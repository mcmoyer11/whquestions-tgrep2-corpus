676:51	###SpeakerA23 . ###Well , the interesting thing \[ was \+ is \] 0 I had heard that , E_S ###and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] tend *-1 to , I think 0 *T*-3 , overreact occasionally when somebody tells me 0 it 's that great *T*-2 .

E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
719:13	###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] more suspense . E_S ###Um , the other one , SILENCE OF THE LAMBS , is kind of \[ a , \+ a \] gory movie , \[ if , \+ if \] somebody 's not into that kind of stuff .

770:13	###but \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 he really knew 0 it was going *-1 to be as big as it was *?* . E_S ###I think 0 it was something that he really wanted *-2 to do *T*-1 .

830:16	###Yeah . E_S ###Real scruffy looking , E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###and \[ it wa- , \+ it *EXP*-2 was \] really funny , \[ it 's , \+ \] uh , \[ that , \+ that \] he winds up *-1 playing in the movie .

839:10	###SpeakerA75 . ###I do n't know how long this conversation is supposed *-1 to go *T*-2 E_S ###but we 're at about five minutes . E_S ###I should think 0 we 've done enough .

865:34	###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Good-bye Sharon . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Good * talking to you Archie .

868:55	###SpeakerB86 . ###Good * talking to you Archie .

E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I agree with that . E_S 
885:97	###and it was sort of exciting E_S ###and so , that was almost an example of \[ s- , \+ \] an invasion that *T*-1 turns out *-2 to be not invasive . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . ###Right , E_S ###it turned out *-1 to be , uh , uh , an invitation . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Exactly . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerB16 . 
926:17	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Um , I guess 0 I 'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to \[ this second , \+ this one \] that you raised *T*-1 .

1396:47	###Okay , E_S ###like I said I guess 0 it would be the work force , you know , as far as changes in the generations .

1877:36	###SpeakerA73 . ###It was , N_S ###ugh , I did n't like that either . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but you know , whatever *T*-1 became of Peter Frampton . E_S ###I mean , there was nothing , N_S ###he was a phenomenon , E_S ###I me- , there was no reason for him to really come into , you know , great stardom or anything . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . 
1886:18	###SpeakerA75 . ###I remember , 0 I saw him in a concert , when I was , N_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 it , N_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###I think 0 it was in high school . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah , E_S 
1895:25	###Yeah , E_S ###I think that probably what *T*-1 did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###He was very good . E_S ###I remember 0 I saw him in a huge stadium in , uh , Philadelphia . E_S ###It was in J F K Stadium , if I can remember . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh man . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . 
1915:40	###I mean , \[ I was , \+ I was \] really into the album oriented music , even then , E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###and you know , I mean , a lot of people they go , they 're better than the Beatles , E_S 
1931:26	###I mean , the comparison made * between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles . It was just , N_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###You can only laugh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah , E_S ###you just sort of , N_S ###you know , well I guess 0 I can just humor them , you know . At this point . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Right E_S ###well , they , N_S 
1939:81	###Right E_S ###well , they , N_S ###I guess 0 our age is showing when , \[ we , \+ we \] think that *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but well , you know , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I 've \] liked a lot of the new music . E_S ###I think , um , um , 0 when N_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . 
1946:71	###SpeakerA97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###I saw some promise , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] a lot of the new wave , \[ when it , \+ when it \] came out , uh , back in the mid and early eighties *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###And then , um , I do n't know E_S ###music \[ is kind of in a weird , \+ it 's in a very weird \] position right now . E_S ###I think that , N_S 
1946:94	###SpeakerA97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###I saw some promise , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] a lot of the new wave , \[ when it , \+ when it \] came out , uh , back in the mid and early eighties *T*-1 .

1959:21	###Like Paul Simon . E_S ###Like , N_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###Paul Simon . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Well , you know , really that 's not world music . E_S 
1965:4	###SpeakerA103 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Well , you know , really that 's not world music . E_S ###But , \[ what , \+ what \] Paul Simon 's doing *T*-1 , I think 0 *T*-5 \[ \[ is , \+ is , \] \+ is \] great because he 's , you know \[ \[ I think , \+ I think \] that \+ \] using , I guess 0 what they call *T*-2 it is *RNR*-3 eclectic , you know . *-4 drawing from a lot of different sources and making , you know , a synthesis of a new type of music . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###SpeakerA107 . 
1968:54	###Well , you know , really that 's not world music . E_S ###But , \[ what , \+ what \] Paul Simon 's doing *T*-1 , I think 0 *T*-5 \[ \[ is , \+ is , \] \+ is \] great because he 's , you know \[ \[ I think , \+ I think \] that \+ \] using , I guess 0 what they call *T*-2 it is *RNR*-3 eclectic , you know . *-4 drawing from a lot of different sources and making , you know , a synthesis of a new type of music . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###SpeakerA107 . ###What do you mean *T*-1 by world music ? E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###Well , world music is , um , N_S 
1977:12	###Well , world music is , um , N_S ###\[ a lot of the , \+ a lot of \] \[ where they , \+ where they \] make music that they adapt *T*-1 \[ \[ to a , \+ to another kind of , \] \+ to another type of \] listener *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###Uh , for example , * let 's say 0 you 're taking like an original Brazilian form of music \[ and , \+ \] with a certain style , E_S ###and then you try *-1 to make it a little bit more listenable for , * let 's say *RNR*-2 another audience , * let 's say *RNR*-3 a North American . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . 
2004:15	###and it 's the same way with , N_S you know , ###world music takes the forms that *T*-1 have really been , um , N_S I guess , 0 I N_S you know , \[ the best example \+ or , you know , the cream of the crop , \] I guess 0 you could say , N_S ###\[ and then , \+ and then \] * taking \[ those , \+ those \] qualities , and then applying , in the styles , \[ that *T*-1 are really , \+ um , that *T*-2 are \] extremely enjoyable , and then taking , N_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###So then it becomes a kind of music \[ of , \+ of \] its own , so * to speak , E_S ###or , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###it becomes a kind of music of its own . E_S 
2027:30	###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] N_S ###\[ a good , \+ another good \] example was I heard Miles Davis , E_S ###and Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar , if you can believe it , E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###I mean , You know , he 's a jazz performer , E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB128 .

6029:16	###And the main , N_S ###SpeakerA183 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Because see what *T*-1 happens is 0 they have a good backup policy . E_S ###SpeakerB184 . ###SpeakerA185 . ###And anybody can fix it . E_S ###SpeakerB186 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA187 . 
6054:34	###SpeakerA193 . ###\[ They , \+ they \] made like , uh , small personal computers . E_S ###SpeakerB194 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Small P C -s . E_S ###MUMBLEx they 're out of Korea ###right ? E_S ###SpeakerA195 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###I do n't know . E_S 
6078:15	###Leading Edge will say we 'll buy it from you . E_S ###SpeakerB202 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA203 . ###And so that 's , N_S ###I mean , they 're still around I think 0 *T*-1 .

6080:34	###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA203 . ###And so that 's , N_S ###I mean , they 're still around I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB204 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ I 've seen , \+ well I 've seen \] them around anyway . You know MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerA205 . ###So , that 's what they do *T*-1 . E_S ###They buy \[ all , \+ all \] the things that I B M throws *T*-1 away E_S 
6100:10	###in a way you realize , N_S ###I mean , \[ one t- , \+ one of my teachers \] got this computer which , you know , N_S ###it 's like , uh , voice , uh , synthesizing stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB210 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA211 . ###And he got that . E_S ###He said , you know , 0 it 's like , uh , N_S ###I was testing it E_S ###and it was wonderful . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerA213 . ###And I want more , you know . E_S ###And it 's like Jesus Christ , you know , N_S 
6122:26	###and you want *-1 to correct the errors into Wave , E_S ###it takes so much , N_S ###I mean , it 's like , N_S ###of course it does .

6180:9	###With just graphics \[ on , \+ on \] a , N_S ###SpeakerA235 . ###Okay ? E_S ###SpeakerB236 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA237 . ###But the only thing was , that it was just lines , E_S ###okay . E_S ###Like if you , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
6195:61	###besides , they tend *-1 to offer \[ ad- , \+ adequate \] vacation , I guess 0 *T*-2 .

6210:5	###Uh-huh E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###And I started *-1 thinking that over the years that importance has changed E_S ###and I suspect that that 's probably true for everyone . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
6220:90	###When I was much younger *T*-1 it *EXP*-2 was , uh , less important * to consider retirement and less important * to consider medical benefits .

7450:75	###and , you know , there 's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States E_S ###and that , you know , N_S ###their , \[ yo- , \+ \] vote 's not going *-1 to make that much difference E_S ###and whether you vote for one person or the other person , the issues is \[ what , \+ you know , what \] you believe in *T*-1 , E_S ###and that person is going *-1 to have a lot of , uh , N_S ###since there 's so many issues , this one person can believe a lot of different ways on , all of them E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA199 . ###SpeakerB200 . ###Of course , you have *-1 to get there early if you want *-2 to get anything , decent . E_S ###SpeakerA201 . ###I know . E_S ###SpeakerB202 . ###SpeakerA203 . 
8291:4	###Well , I was reading the book , E_S ###and it 's called *-1 SHOELESS JOE . E_S ###SpeakerB218 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerA219 . ###It was so wonderful . E_S ###And then \[ I was , \+ um , I decided , \] well , I like this author , E_S ###so I got a , uh , book of his short stories , E_S ###and that 's been real good . E_S ###SpeakerB220 . 
8348:25	###and , uh , um , it *EXP*-2 was a real excitement * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] go out and select the house and have one made and built *-1 E_S and like you wanted it , ###we were the fourth *ICH*-1 0 *T*-2 to build out of three hundred and forty houses . E_S ###And , um , as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home , E_S ###and they 're good for about five years or four years E_S ###and after that they start *-1 falling apart . E_S ###So , I would , uh , not recommend F and J house 0 for my dog to live in *T*-1 , uh , because they 're overpriced , uh , E_S ###but they 're a cheap house . E_S ###If you ca n't afford something good , you know , E_S ###they 're good for that , E_S ###and , um , you can call it a home because it 's a place 0 * to go home and keep the rain off your head *T*-1 , E_S 
8378:46	###and I mean it 's nothing fancy , you know , E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a house , E_S ###it 's nice , E_S ###and it 's real pretty E_S ###and we 're all comfortable in it . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , that 's great , E_S ###that 's great , E_S ###that 's , uh , N_S ###I 've heard , N_S 
8432:49	###well , N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###First one is always a bear . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###We 're having \[ a , \+ an \] architect friend of mine design a house for us E_S ###and that can basically \[ be , \+ be \] put \[ on any lot , \+ in any state , \] \[ any kin- , \+ \] you know , E_S 
8485:54	###SpeakerB40 . ###That 's all , E_S ###\[ on- , \+ you only \] have *-1 to , uh , satisfy yourself and no one else . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###\[ Ap- , \+ apparently \] the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Oh , \[ that 's , \+ uh , that 's , \] uh , an encouraging sign if you ever want *-1 to resell , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Is n't it *?* ? E_S ###It really is *?* E_S 
8504:129	###SpeakerB46 . ###Nice * talking with you , too . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Okay , E_S ###bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that I , um , N_S ###since I 'm in school I do n't , like , basically have a monthly budget because I 'm living off my dad , E_S 
8507:41	###Okay , E_S ###bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that I , um , N_S ###since I 'm in school I do n't , like , basically have a monthly budget because I 'm living off my dad , E_S ###but the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , I have *-1 to keep it under control because , for example , you know , it 's like \[ the , \+ the \] beginning of the semester when you go *-2 to pay for everything *T*-3 , everything is pretty rough , E_S ###but he controls that part E_S ###but , then whenever , you know , N_S 
8507:63	###Okay , E_S ###bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that I , um , N_S ###since I 'm in school I do n't , like , basically have a monthly budget because I 'm living off my dad , E_S ###but the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , I have *-1 to keep it under control because , for example , you know , it 's like \[ the , \+ the \] beginning of the semester when you go *-2 to pay for everything *T*-3 , everything is pretty rough , E_S ###but he controls that part E_S ###but , then whenever , you know , N_S 
8512:4	###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that I , um , N_S ###since I 'm in school I do n't , like , basically have a monthly budget because I 'm living off my dad , E_S ###but the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , I have *-1 to keep it under control because , for example , you know , it 's like \[ the , \+ the \] beginning of the semester when you go *-2 to pay for everything *T*-3 , everything is pretty rough , E_S ###but he controls that part E_S ###but , then whenever , you know , N_S ###it 's like , once the semester starts I 'm the one who *T*-1 has *-2 to control how much spending there is *T*-3 . E_S ###And the only thing that \[ I , \+ I \] basically spend my money on *T*-1 is just food E_S ###\[ and , \+ um , so , \] N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###What about tuition and rent ? E_S 
8518:14	###And the only thing that \[ I , \+ I \] basically spend my money on *T*-1 is just food E_S ###\[ and , \+ um , so , \] N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###What about tuition and rent ? E_S ###Who *T*-1 takes care of that ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that I live in a dorm . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
8532:36	###And then the tuition is also the same thing . E_S ###So , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] basically that I spend , like , maybe thirty-five , forty dollars every two weeks \[ on , \+ on \] groceries E_S ###and that 's about it . E_S ###But the thing , uh , also is that , you know , like if you want *-1 to go out like if you want *-2 to go to a restaurant or something , then I have *-3 to moderate that because it 's like I ca n't go *-4 eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars , um , you know , three times a week . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###No , E_S ###you ca n't do that very often . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###So , I mean , it 's , N_S ###\[ for , \+ for \] us , you know , it 's like , \[ \[ I , I \+ \] can spend , \+ I can spend \] that money E_S 
8552:6	###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###And so \[ they , \+ the government \] does n't allow me to work . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so all the money comes from home . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###So , you got *-1 to make , uh , N_S 
8552:26	###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###And so \[ they , \+ the government \] does n't allow me to work . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so all the money comes from home . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###So , you got *-1 to make , uh , N_S 
8554:73	###And so \[ they , \+ the government \] does n't allow me to work . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so all the money comes from home . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###So , you got *-1 to make , uh , N_S ###so how do you keep track of where you are *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] your monthly spending *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
8565:4	###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And so , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that \[ I , \+ I \] can tell like , uh , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] get all my money out of the teller . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have *-1 to call , you know , international . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
8597:4	###if you want *-1 to save money I wo n't call so often , you know , E_S ###he goes , we want *-1 to keep in touch E_S ###so I does n't matter about the money because we need *-1 to hear from you . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so you call him collect ? E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###No . E_S ###Because it is more expensive that way . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
8633:23	###So , it 's basically , you know , N_S ###\[ it 's \+ like , it 's \] not too much money , E_S ###and it 's not too little money , E_S ###so I wo n't have *-1 to , you know , rush a letter to him or something , E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###because , um , he really wants me to concentrate on my studies . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S 
8637:6	###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###because , um , he really wants me to concentrate on my studies . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###And hopefully * get a job after that . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###You want *-1 to get into some kind of manufacturing , E_S 
8684:47	###well , it 's kind of hard 0 * to say *T*-1 now days , ###um , other than * taking care of the house , she does a lot of sewing herself . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###And she gets paid *-1 for that E_S ###so she brings some money in . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . 
8697:46	###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###and , uh , * do that \[ on a , \+ on a \] full time basis here in town . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###\[ And so , \+ and \] you have a monthly budget ? E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Well , \[ s- , \+ sort \] of . E_S ###We 're probably like most \[ Am- , \+ American \] families , 
8701:13	###and , uh , * do that \[ on a , \+ on a \] full time basis here in town . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###\[ And so , \+ and \] you have a monthly budget ? E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Well , \[ s- , \+ sort \] of . E_S ###We 're probably like most \[ Am- , \+ American \] families , ###I guess , that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we 've got *T*-1 at the end of the month , E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . 
8714:21	###SpeakerA79 . ###So , you do n't have any problem in , um , * overcharging on your credit card , and stuff like that . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh sure . E_S ###We 're like everybody else , you know , E_S ###we 've got \[ a , \+ several \] credit cards that sometimes , um , instead of *-1 paying *T*-2 them all off every month maybe you have *-1 to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . 
8716:65	###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh sure . E_S ###We 're like everybody else , you know , E_S ###we 've got \[ a , \+ several \] credit cards that sometimes , um , instead of *-1 paying *T*-2 them all off every month maybe you have *-1 to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###You know , that 's when everybody goes crazy on * charging stuff *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . 
8726:59	###Well then , uh , see , uh , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] one of the points which I do n't see *T*-1 , E_S ###like \[ I , \+ I \] do n't give a lot of gifts during Christmas E_S ###and \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't wa- , \+ I do n't like \] *-1 to give any at all E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###because the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , you know , it 's like if I want something \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] ask somebody , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . 
8757:34	###That 's great . Utilitarian . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###SpeakerB96 . ###SpeakerA97 . ###Right , E_S ###but N_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Necessary things , no frivolous gifts . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###right , E_S 
8783:12	###Well , * especially being a college student \[ yo- , \+ your , \] N_S ###I do n't know that you need *-1 to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving , you know , E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###that effects the budget especially around , uh , Christmas time E_S ###at the end of the semester you 've got finals and lots of bills I would suspect 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . 
8806:19	###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###I mean , N_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Because \[ it 's like , you know , say , \+ you know , it 's like , we were saying , \] * let 's go *-1 eat out before spring break . E_S ###I go , * let 's not go *-1 eat out , before spring break . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###MUMBLEx . ###SpeakerA117 . 
8815:44	###SpeakerA117 . ###* Let 's see how much money we have *T*-1 afterwards . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Right , MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###And if I felt like I spent way to much then , um , I wo n't go out , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###and so , like my roommate went home , E_S 
8835:30	###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###SpeakerA127 . ###Yeah , E_S ###especially if you live on campus , and you do n't have a car , you just go crazy . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I know the feeling . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . 
8858:34	###Nice * talking to you . E_S ###* Have a good time . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###All right . E_S ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###I guess , um , 0 I 'm going to school while I 'm working at T I , E_S ###so there 's not a whole a lot of time that I 've got *T*-1 , uh , for hobbies it seems like *T*-2 lately . E_S 
8874:58	###SpeakerA3 . ###There 's something about * working with wood \[ that , \+ that \] I enjoy *T*-1 , that , N_S ###I do n't know if it 's the saw dust or the mess 0 you make *T*-1 or the smell of the wood E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###As you know , I think 0 it 's more like the mess 0 you make *T*-1 , is n't it *?* ? E_S ###You do n't have *-1 to worry about *-2 cleaning it up . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###because \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] out there . E_S 
8878:4	###SpeakerB4 . ###As you know , I think 0 it 's more like the mess 0 you make *T*-1 , is n't it *?* ? E_S ###You do n't have *-1 to worry about *-2 cleaning it up . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###because \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] out there . E_S ###You know I do n't have *-1 to worry about *-2 getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust *T*-3 , E_S ###and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that , E_S ###but then , I get the opportunity *-1 to vacuum , E_S ###so I guess 0 I get some of both . E_S 
8880:10	###You do n't have *-1 to worry about *-2 cleaning it up . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###because \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] out there . E_S ###You know I do n't have *-1 to worry about *-2 getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust *T*-3 , E_S ###and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that , E_S ###but then , I get the opportunity *-1 to vacuum , E_S ###so I guess 0 I get some of both . E_S ###What *T*-1 are some of your things 0 you like *-2 to do *T*-3 ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . 
8887:22	###so I guess 0 I get some of both . E_S ###What *T*-1 are some of your things 0 you like *-2 to do *T*-3 ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , when I have time *T*-1 I do like *-2 to sew , E_S ###um , I had been doing a lot of crocheting . E_S ###I make a lot of afghans or used *-1 to make a lot of them . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###My mother was real heavy into crafts , E_S 
8916:21	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Do you find 0 you do most of \[ your , \+ your , \] uh , crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time ? E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###I usually start in the fall . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###And my husband says 0 I do it , you know , make afghans so I can keep my lap warm . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
8948:21	###SpeakerA25 . ###I think tha- , N_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Mile a Minute . E_S ###That 's the name of it . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Mile a Minute . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Mile a Minute . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
8981:48	###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###We ca n't have that down here . E_S ###We get disconnected *-1 all the time . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Well , I guess \[ 0 that 's , \+ 0 that 's \] one way 0 * to end a conversation *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , it gets a little aggravating . E_S ###I 've got kids all over the United States E_S 
8992:10	###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###What , N_S ###have you started your garden yet ? E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yes . E_S ###We planted , um , potatoes and onions and bell peppers . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Um , boy . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
9021:18	###SpeakerB50 . ###Besides they 're fun 0 * to grow *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###I planted , uh , zucchini last year . E_S ###Uh , I planted four hills of them . E_S ###I think 0 I had three or four seeds in each one of them , E_S ###and those things just flat took over . E_S ###Um , it was n't until late , I guess in the summer , E_S ###maybe it was because it was too dry , E_S ###they finally started *-1 making zucchini , E_S 
9034:62	###Supposedly after the soil warms up . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###I would think so , um , E_S ###* seems like \[ these all , \+ they all \] went \[ to , \+ uh , to \] leaf , E_S ###and it was n't until late in the summer 0 they started *-1 making fruit *T*-2 . E_S ###So , I do n't know if I , N_S ###Mom would say 0 you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon . You know , E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . 
9066:7	###Well that 's about , um , N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###We decided this year , N_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###* Go ahead . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###I 'm sorry , E_S ###* go ahead . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Well , I was just going *-1 to say , 0 it 's a little over six or seven minutes . E_S 
9086:41	###Well , I 've enjoyed *-1 talking to you . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###All right , E_S ###* have a good time . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Okay . E_S ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
9111:148	###I grew up in Los Angeles and have felt like I was victimized *-1 by air pollution . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###I was going *-1 to say , N_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ and \] you , \+ so you \] understand smog . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###I understand it very well E_S ###and in fact I was a private pilot there , E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . 
9154:148	###So did it burn coal ? E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###I do n't know that , E_S ###the information is one of those wire services kind of \[ news , \+ pieces of news , \] you know , E_S ###so it 's hard , E_S ###I never did see the full story , E_S ###so I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
9166:9	###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###I mean that 's such a spectacle . E_S ###It *EXP*-1 would be a shame * to ruin it . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
9174:42	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh , what do you think 0 individuals could do *T*-1 , or society could do *T*-1 * to alleviate this problem . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ uh , I do n't \] know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals . ###Uh , maybe just take good care of our cars , and make * sure 0 we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
9175:4	###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh , what do you think 0 individuals could do *T*-1 , or society could do *T*-1 * to alleviate this problem . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ uh , I do n't \] know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals . ###Uh , maybe just take good care of our cars , and make * sure 0 we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###apart from that , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what we can do *T*-1 as individuals . E_S 
9205:16	###they , N_S ###all those \[ re- , \+ restrictions \] are really too hard , E_S ###\[ we ca n't , \+ we ca n't \] quite make that go E_S ###and they do n't N_S ###and then we still live with air pollution . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Um , so I suspect that that 's one thing \[ that , \+ that \] as individuals , we can do *T*-1 , * make our voices known , perhaps to our legislators . E_S ###But , um , as a society , I think 0 we can do more *T*-1 E_S 
9208:49	###and they do n't N_S ###and then we still live with air pollution . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Um , so I suspect that that 's one thing \[ that , \+ that \] as individuals , we can do *T*-1 , * make our voices known , perhaps to our legislators . E_S ###But , um , as a society , I think 0 we can do more *T*-1 E_S ###and that 's probably how we ought *-2 to do it *T*-1 . Uh , \[ individ- , \+ *-2 being individually responsible \] \[ as , uh , gro- , \+ in order *-3 to be group responsible . \] E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah , E_S 
9222:25	###And in the case of air pollution , it simply might turn out at some point down the road , *-1 to be so costly *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 * to have *-3 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems , and everything else that we 'll spend the money that *T*-6 's necessary * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get rid *-2 of the source of it . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###I suspect \[ that the pub- , \+ \] that there 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be a lot of pressure , uh , come * to bear on the companies that *T*-4 deal with it E_S ###and probably the only way 0 that can happen *T*-1 is for , um , governments to realize that they have *-2 to pay if companies do n't . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . 
9263:22	###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh , you know , wha- , N_S ###however , it might have had other causes . E_S ###Certainly oil was a big factor . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Oh certainly , E_S ###yes . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Um , and I think 0 that 's probably going *-1 to happen \[ with , \+ with \] such things as air pollution , 
9276:35	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###do you have any air pollution in your area ? E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###There 's not really a lot here in Raleigh .

9293:80	###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###that 's what they say *T*-1 E_S ###but \[ \[ it 's \+ it 's not , \] \+ it 's not \] very usual E_S ###and certainly we do n't have the eye stinging variety that you get *T*-1 in the big cities .

9438:39	###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh yes . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###and this , N_S ###it was just , N_S ###the humidity was like \[ eighty plus , \+ eighty percent plus \] E_S ###and it was just killing us . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Oh yeah , E_S ###it 's terrible . E_S

9523:22	###And I would MUMBLEx it like that , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] like the adventure of it .

9546:22	###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah , E_S ###those , N_S ###the movies are good too .

9551:50	###SpeakerA13 . ###And \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 \[ all , \+ most \] of the shows 0 I like *T*-1 are , are kind of along the same line because they 're all adventure .

9617:49	###SpeakerB42 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###I guess 0 I have n't ever had any trouble with that .

9636:29	###SpeakerB48 . ###Right , E_S ###well , when my kids were little *T*-1 , I did have a T V set E_S ###and I did watch a lot of SESAME STREET and a lot of ELECTRIC COMPANY , as well .

E_S 
9667:35	###SpeakerB56 . ###I see . E_S ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###So that 's still a real good show too . E_S ###I , N_S ###that one tends *-1 to come on earlier in the day than I want *-2 to turn the T V on . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
9670:54	###SpeakerA57 . ###So that 's still a real good show too . E_S ###I , N_S ###that one tends *-1 to come on earlier in the day than I want *-2 to turn the T V on .

9726:25	###I think 0 \[ some shows , \+ some , \] N_S ###STAR TREK , I , N_S ###for the imagination of it all .

11211:14	###SpeakerA57 . ###Well the last time , ###uh , someone moved offices in my building E_S ###and , uh , the , uh , properties people came in \[ with all , \+ with the \] good cardboard boxes .

11335:64	###SpeakerB102 . ###But ours are real hard 0 * to find *T*-1 . E_S ###That 's the one thing that *T*-1 really discourages me .

11409:7	###they come and empty your trash ###every other day they do your normal trash E_S ###and every other day they do your recycling trash . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###Uh-huh .

11951:16	###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###Oh yeah .

12003:175	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Uh , how we go about that *T*-1 , \[ it 's \+ uh , uh , it 's \] a little bit difficult .

E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah , E_S 
12022:9	###I mean , I remember *-1 reading an article that *T*-2 said like , 0 it 's , uh , the older polluters , E_S ###\[ the , \+ the \] twelve and fifteen year old cars , you know , contribute like ninety percent , of the automobile pollution E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###and the new cars \[ it 's hardly \+ is , hardly \] anything .

12066:110	###SpeakerA97 . ###A lot of people do n't even like *-1 to carpool . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###But we could that . E_S ###That 'll help , \[ pollution , \+ air pollution , \] E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . 
12077:9	###SpeakerB102 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###I guess 0 Canada 's quite concerned that we 're sending a lot of our stuff up there , E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Yeah , E_S ###sure . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###So that 's helping . E_S ###SpeakerB106 .

12119:27	###but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off .

E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###And that 's MUMBLEx . N_S ###SpeakerB118 . 
12156:37	###Uh , but you know a proposal to , uh , uh , I guess the proper authorities , N_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S 
12177:10	###SpeakerB4 . ###And I find that \[ I , \+ \] that 's pretty easy 0 * to cook *T*-1 because a lot of it is one dish meals , type things and , 0 they 're kind of convenient .

12197:4	###SpeakerA13 . ###Really , E_S ###that sounds good . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###Um , fattening . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###actually . E_S ###How about you , E_S 
12223:16	###because I 'm from New Orleans originally . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And , um , I was going *-1 to make that , red beans and rice with \[ the , \+ those \] Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff , E_S ###and , uh , well there 's salad E_S ###and then for desert \[ I would , \+ \] I really wanted *-1 to make , um , just brownies E_S ###or French donuts would have been good , E_S ###but it *EXP*-1 's real hard * to make them .

E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###I do n't know if it 's me or the water or the recipe 0 I have *T*-1 E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Humidity or something . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
12233:12	###I do n't know why . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Oh really . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###I do n't know if it 's me or the water or the recipe 0 I have *T*-1 E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Humidity or something . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###um , that 's what I want *T*-1 . E_S 
12246:47	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Kind of like the Italian , E_S ###it 's really good , E_S ###but instead I catered to their diet E_S ###so I made baked chicken in the crock pot E_S ###and , um , it was good and everything , E_S ###it had all the vegetables in it , E_S ###but , it seemed kind of boring compared , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
12257:4	###SpeakerA31 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Do you find yourself , um , with all the , um , cholesterol \[ and , \+ and \] high fiber changing the way \[ that you fi- , \+ that you entertain *T*-1 ? \] E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###I find it changing the way that I eat *T*-1 , but not the way 0 I entertain *T*-2 , E_S ###because \[ I guess , \+ I guess \] 0 I feel like if they 're on a diet like that , I 'm going *-1 to , you know , honor that , E_S ###but if it 's just N_S ###another couple came , um , over a couple weeks later E_S ###and I made , N_S 
12270:5	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###and I made , um , uh , N_S ###I ca n't believe this E_S ###my husband broke the coffee pot 0 I just bought *T*-1 yesterday . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh no . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###I ca n't believe that . E_S ###Anyway , but I asked , N_S 
12278:17	###I ca n't believe that . E_S ###Anyway , but I asked , N_S ###when Ricky and Carrie came over *T*-1 we made , um , a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###And normally \[ I , do n't eat , \+ we do n't eat \] like that during the week because of \[ the , \+ you know , the \] calories and the fat in it . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
12297:20	###SpeakerA45 . ###But , I do n't think 0 we gained any weight from it E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Well , every once in a while \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I feel the same way . E_S ###When I 'm entertaining *T*-1 , I do n't take that thing into consideration unless it 's really , really , N_S ###like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it 's too rich simply because they do n't want the extra calories , E_S ###so I think 0 dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play *T*-1 , sometimes . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right , E_S 
12312:51	###But I did bake apples so that it would be , not brownies , you know . E_S ###I figured 0 there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies .

13664:18	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh , I have wondered why they allowed , or let , you know , both the father and mother go *T*-1 , uh , E_S ###and the children are left *-1 without either parent .

13759:148	###Maybe we 'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of , say , *-1 taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care *T*-2 .

E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah . E_S ###As long as Troy \[ Ot- , \+ Aikman \] does n't get hurt *-1 again . E_S ###That kind of killed them at the end of the season last year . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . 
14324:9	###for a while there MUMBLEx , N_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###I 've never been over impressed with him . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Well , \[ he could always get past , \+ you know , he 'd get past \] like six or seven tackles and just keep *-1 spinning around and get on into the end zone . E_S ###But , um , I guess 0 you never could really see him play , because with the Cowboys , while he was with the team , the rest of the team was pretty poor E_S ###so you could n't really tell if it was just him or the team E_S ###and I always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team . E_S ###But , I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . 
14352:5	###and he was supposed *-1 to go . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###I 'm not sure . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I kind of , \+ I \] have n't been keeping up with football , ###I mean , in the fall E_S \[ I , \+ I \] can go on and on about football , E_S ###but since it 's kind of off season , it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard * to think back about all that . E_S ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
14371:4	###SpeakerB34 . ###Bu- , N_S ###Jerry Burns . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###No earthly idea . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###\[ Goin- , ke- , \+ he was going *-1 to keep \] him as the coach somehow , E_S ###but , uh , I do n't know , E_S ###I 'd like *-1 to see the Vikings get revamped *-2 somehow . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . 
14425:9	###Because \[ now , \+ now , \] you know , he had a shot \[ and , \+ and \] did n't look too good E_S ###and so , no one 's going *-1 to have much faith in him any more . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###In fact , I think 0 they 're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback . E_S ###\[ I have n't , \+ uh , I have n't \] kept up with it lately , E_S ###but I remember *-1 reading something *ICH*-2 a few months ago about them signing somebody else on , \[ or , \+ or \] trying *-3 to go after somebody or trade for somebody , E_S ###but it was n't anybody 0 I 'd really heard of *T*-1 . E_S ###But I heard on the radio this morning , or yesterday morning , that , uh , Aikman 's back in *-1 practicing , doing real , real well . E_S 
14447:21	###I think 0 it was *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###\[ I think 0 it , \+ I think 0 it \] was his shoulder 0 he had surgery on *T*-1 . E_S ###But anyway , they 're trying *-1 to \[ keep him , \+ you know , keep him , \] uh , from *-2 reinjuring anything , ###but anyway . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###But , uh , well I got my thirty day notice yesterday . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Thirty day notice for what ? E_S ###SpeakerB58 . 
14470:24	###Oh , w- , N_S ###I 've always ran out of time ever since I 've done this . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Really . E_S ###I usually have *?* , too . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###They always say 0 you 've talked your ten minute limit . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 've done that once or twice . E_S 
14478:20	###Yeah , E_S ###I 've done that once or twice . E_S ###I did n't look at the clock when we started *-1 talking *T*-2 , E_S ###so I guess 0 we should talk about football a little bit longer just *-1 to be sure 0 we got five minutes in . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###* Make * sure 0 we get our cash flow . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . 
14480:15	###I did n't look at the clock when we started *-1 talking *T*-2 , E_S ###so I guess 0 we should talk about football a little bit longer just *-1 to be sure 0 we got five minutes in . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###* Make * sure 0 we get our cash flow . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###So other than the Vikings , who do you like *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB70 . 
14491:22	###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh , oh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###* Remember Jim Hart ? E_S ###Jim Hart was playing . E_S ###Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals . E_S ###This was a long time ago . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . 
14498:8	###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Um , I do n't know who else I 've ever . N_S ###That 's about it , E_S ###I was always a Viking fan . E_S ###I think 0 I was into the Cardinals for a little bit E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
14505:66	###and , N_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Back when they were in Saint Louis *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Yes , E_S ###oh , of course . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Since they 've been to Phoenix they have n't been , uh , all that impressive , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###I guess 0 I 've always been a Cowboy fan . E_S 
14516:67	###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , the Cowboys were \[ th- , \+ \] America 's football team , E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###there 's no question about that , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S 
14523:39	###so . N_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I mean \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 \] was really exciting , * growing up \[ when , \+ when \] the Cowboys were really big *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###SpeakerA83 . ###Because my parents would always have season tickets , E_S ###and they 'd go to all the games , E_S ###and you know , the hype were just unbelievable . E_S ###It 's just , you know , the last , oh N_S 
14538:4	###and , you know , \[ they 'll , \+ they 'll \] wind up *-1 being good again . E_S ###They 've got \[ some , \+ lot \] of really good young players \[ that *T*-1 are going *-2 to , \+ that *T*-3 are going *-4 to , \] uh , do pretty good , I think 0 *T*-5 . E_S ###But , they 're raising prices on their tickets . E_S ###So they 're banking on *-1 doing good next season . E_S ###I think 0 tickets are , N_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Again . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . 
14553:45	###They used *T*-1 to just have like , uh , N_S ###first of all it was all one price . E_S ###And then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else . E_S ###And now they 're sectioning it off \[ to \+ like \[ from the , \+ from one \] \] twenty yard line to the other one , E_S ###just on the lower levels is the highest price , E_S ###and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level , E_S ###and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line . E_S ###And then they 're some sections kind of in the corner areas , E_S ###and then the cheapest of course is going *-1 to be \[ the end , \+ the direct end \] zones . E_S ###But , um , they have about four or five different prices *ICH*-1 now , E_S that they 're structuring it with *T*-2 , E_S 
14560:34	###And then they 're some sections kind of in the corner areas , E_S ###and then the cheapest of course is going *-1 to be \[ the end , \+ the direct end \] zones . E_S ###But , um , they have about four or five different prices *ICH*-1 now , E_S that they 're structuring it with *T*-2 , E_S ###but obviously yeah , they 're all going up , MUMBLEx more or less is what it 's going *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Um , you know , I 'm not sure , E_S ###I 'm not positive , E_S ###\[ I did n't , \+ I did n't \] really think about that . E_S 
14564:95	###SpeakerB88 . ###So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Um , you know , I 'm not sure , E_S ###I 'm not positive , E_S ###\[ I did n't , \+ I did n't \] really think about that . E_S ###I just remember *-1 trying *-2 to figure out where you could get N_S ###that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper . E_S ###But , not that I 'll ever go . E_S ###I had n't been to a Cowboys game , N_S 
14615:4	###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so . My name is Fernando . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Well , my name 's Mary . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###SpeakerB14 . ###Fernando , glad * to know you . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###So , um , do you , well , N_S 
14626:13	###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh , I was visiting my son down in Dallas , E_S ###and . N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Oh , okay , E_S ###he works for T I . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###No , E_S ###no , E_S ###but his wife has a contract with T I , E_S 
14651:13	###SpeakerB24 . ###I 'm ready . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Okay , E_S ###* let 's get started . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###All right , E_S ###okay . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Okay , E_S 
14652:39	###I 'm ready . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Okay , E_S ###* let 's get started . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###All right , E_S ###okay . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Okay , E_S ###so , uh , what do you think , that , uh , N_S 
14657:33	###All right , E_S ###okay . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Okay , E_S ###so , uh , what do you think , that , uh , N_S ###\[ \[ what do , \+ what do , \] \+ what do \] you think 0 we can do *T*-1 * to solve the crime in America ? E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Oh , if I knew that I 'd be a very wealthy person . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S 
14662:15	###\[ \[ what do , \+ what do , \] \+ what do \] you think 0 we can do *T*-1 * to solve the crime in America ? E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Oh , if I knew that I 'd be a very wealthy person .

E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Well , you have *-1 to see , E_S ###\[ I , \+ the way 0 I \] look at it *T*-1 , you have *-2 to think first of all why , E_S ###or \[ ha- , \+ has \] \] crime increased , E_S 
14664:47	###Oh , if I knew that I 'd be a very wealthy person . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but \[ \[ what , \+ what , \] \+ what \] are the steps *T*-1 ?

E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
14677:8	###SpeakerA33 . ###Because in the country , people still respect , uh , the property of other people . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###And so , \[ as , \+ as , \] N_S ###and the people in the country do n't want as much as the people in the city . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . 
14679:13	###SpeakerB34 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###And so , \[ as , \+ as , \] N_S ###and the people in the country do n't want as much as the people in the city . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Now what *T*-1 happens is 0 all those that *T*-2 do n't have any money in the country move to the cities , E_S ###and they rush *-1 to get the same thing . E_S 
14681:7	###SpeakerA35 . ###And so , \[ as , \+ as , \] N_S ###and the people in the country do n't want as much as the people in the city . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###They say , why ca n't we have the same things that these other people have *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S ###and the thing that we can do *T*-1 is , 0 we need money for drugs , E_S 
14692:22	###SpeakerB38 . ###It 's easy , E_S ###you said the magic word there . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Which one ? E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Drugs . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
14714:25	###I mean , the thing \[ is \+ is \] that , you know , it 's like you might be standing somewhere , right , E_S ###and like * let 's say 0 \[ \[ \[ you , \+ you 're , \] \+ you 're , \] \+ you know , you 're \] driving out E_S ###and you 're driving back home E_S ###and it 's late at night . E_S ###And you stop by one of these , you know , twenty-four hour , you know , gas stations joints . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###And , uh , somebody walks in there with a gun . E_S ###I mean , they 're going *-1 to want the money , E_S 
14730:41	###SpeakerA49 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S ###and so . N_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Well , but you know , \[ the , \+ the \] \[ strange thing , \+ uh , perhaps , not strange , but something that many people do n't realize *T*-1 , \] is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying *-2 to influence the high school kids , E_S ###because , uh , I 'm a retired educator . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
14730:67	###SpeakerA49 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S ###and so .

14787:52	###SpeakerB68 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###That 's right , E_S ###and , they , N_S ###one person does n't know the other person down the line . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . 
14787:95	###SpeakerB68 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###That 's right , E_S ###and , they , N_S ###one person does n't know the other person down the line . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . 
14796:18	###SpeakerB72 . ###But the guy at the very top , the one \[ who *T*-1 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] really making the millions and the millions is the one who *T*-3 also many times is part of the power structure , uh , \[ the , \+ \] uh , and had the political uh , pull to \[ keep things from , \+ uh , keep \] the interest or the emphasis in some other direction , other than on the drug dealing , E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah .

14957:14	###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###Well , I 've been pretty lucky in that respect .

15073:23	###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###And then before the milk gets too hot , um , I add two beaten eggs ###and I really mix them in good . ###And then about a half a cup of sugar E_S ###and I let it pretty much , E_S ###I beat it like every minute for about ten seconds E_S ###and \[ it 's , \+ it starts \] *-1 thickening , E_S 
16353:14	###when it thickens *T*-1 the cornstarch might get a little , I do n't know , N_S ###it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch , E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Oh , huh . Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###and you just keep *-1 beating it in . E_S ###And it 's the , N_S ###the trick \[ is , \+ is \] *-1 to have this blender , E_S ###so , if you were , N_S ###you 'd have *-1 to probably almost go out E_S 
16413:38	###Cooking chocolate . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but , um , N_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###That 's really interesting , E_S ###I 've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before ###that 's really neat . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Well , I used *-1 to make the regular pudding , the chocolate and put it in the pie shell E_S 
16417:9	###SpeakerB96 . ###That 's really interesting , E_S ###I 've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before ###that 's really neat . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Well , I used *-1 to make the regular pudding , the chocolate and put it in the pie shell E_S ###and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day , where you cut the pie *T*-1 , it would soak into the pie shell E_S ###and it was like red , E_S ###and I 'm like , oh , N_S this is kind of groedy . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . 
16473:54	###SpeakerB114 . ###Huh that 's , N_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Because by the vanilla does n't seem *-1 to thicken as well as the , N_S ###sometimes the cocoa is N_S ###like , my husband really likes it thick E_S ###he says , I can stick the spoon right in this . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . 
16474:5	###Huh that 's , N_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Because by the vanilla does n't seem *-1 to thicken as well as the , N_S ###sometimes the cocoa is N_S ###like , my husband really likes it thick E_S ###he says , I can stick the spoon right in this . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###Because I 'm always worrying 0 it wo n't firm up because \[ it , \+ when you take it \] out of the saucepan *T*-1 it 's like , boy , I hope 0 this thickens a little more because it 's not like real package thick , you know , E_S 
16485:9	###SpeakerB118 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###but I put it in a nice glass bowl E_S ###and , um , some people do n't like \[ that , \+ that , \] film on the pudding E_S ###so you can put , uh , Saran Wrap over the top . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###And then once the pudding starts *-1 cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap , E_S 
16493:20	###SpeakerA121 . ###And then once the pudding starts *-1 cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap , E_S ###so , when you pull the Saran Wrap back *T*-1 , you sort of should be a little careful , pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap E_S ###and I might put it back on . E_S ###But , um , N_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###\[ Do yo- , \+ do you \] put it in the refrigerator then E_S ###or y- , N_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###Yeah , E_S 
16509:18	###SpeakerB126 . ###Right , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###I knew that . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###That 's , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . 
16522:13	###SpeakerA131 . ###So , well , I do n't know E_S ###that 's \[ my , \+ my \] great hard recipe .

18979:34	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###And so , you know , you could also apply the magazines toward that . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Well , that would be a help . E_S ###I wish 0 they would do that here . E_S ###We have got so little landfill space left * that we 're going *-1 to run out before the end of this decade . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yes .

19006:58	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###And then you put all your \[ lar- , \+ \] yard clippings and , uh , leaf rakings and anything that *T*-1 will be compostible .

19204:53	###Right .

19301:16	###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###Right .

20131:23	###Well , \[ how , \+ how \] do you feel *T*-1 about the immigration laws ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###At , N_S ###currently , I think 0 they are a little restrictive .

E_S ###Um , I think 0 we should permit , uh , more immigration from eastern Europe , for example , uh , particularly \[ the , \+ uh , the \] Jewish , uh , , uh , people from Russia . E_S ###I think 0 we could permit more of them *ICH*-1 in than we have permitted *?* in the last , uh , several years . E_S ###And , I think 0 we have , uh , uh , too much restriction \[ on the , \+ uh , on the \] Orientals also , E_S ###but , of course , that 's just my opinion . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah , E_S 
20146:275	###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , we seem *-1 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] favor certain , uh , uh , countries particularly South American countries .

E_S ###Of course , that 's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern Europe , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
20177:123	###so , I 'm a little touchy *ICH*-1 every now and then about that . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah .

20214:134	###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 if immigration was entirely unrestricted , uh , not only \[ would , \+ would \] the United States become \[ over populated , \+ well , more over populated \] awfully quickly , I think 0 *T*-3 \[ it , \+ it \] would bring in a lot of , uh , people that *T*-1 are , run *-2 out of other countries or in trouble \[ in , \+ in \] other countries .

E_S ###Age is one , for example , E_S 
20272:87	###SpeakerB4 . ###I have *-1 to agree that . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And you 're right .

20385:16	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Well , you know , um , back then what they tried *-2 to do *T*-1 , you know , N_S ###the MUMBLEx would always try *-1 to stump Jesus , try *-2 to give him something that *T*-3 would contradict himself , E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Right .

20769:5	###or are you familiar with any of that ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I know that we have some relatives that *T*-1 live around , like the MUMBLEx area in there , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###I know 0 they 're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah . E_S ###You know , I read , you know , N_S 
20770:79	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I know that we have some relatives that *T*-1 live around , like the MUMBLEx area in there , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###I know 0 they 're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah . E_S ###You know , I read , you know , N_S ###when they first started *-2 doing that in the paper , \[ and \+ \] I read about that *T*-1 , E_S I was just praying that , that would be in our area , because we 've been recycling for quite some time . E_S 
20795:50	###Oh , God . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Because I finally asked because , you know , we had all of those milk cartons E_S ###and there was nowhere else 0 * to take them *T*-1 E_S ###and they had it in front of Wal-Mart E_S ###and I ask in Wal-Mart E_S ###and they said 0 they moved it just behind . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh . E_S ###That 's really nice 0 * to know *T*-1 , because we were doing the same thing . E_S 
20795:79	###Oh , God .

20799:10	###and they had it in front of Wal-Mart E_S ###and I ask in Wal-Mart E_S ###and they said 0 they moved it just behind . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh . E_S ###That 's really nice 0 * to know *T*-1 , because we were doing the same thing . E_S ###Because *-1 to take it to a Metco , you have *-1 to take it when they 're open *T*-3 , you know , which *T*-2 is always a real pain . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
20809:22	###And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot *T*-1 , we thought , oh , this is great . E_S ###And we started *-1 taking them up there . E_S ###And then , all the sudden , it disappeared , you know . E_S ###I did n't know . E_S ###And we 're going , oh , no , there goes our recycling place . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###That 's really nice 0 * to find *T*-1 out that it 's behind there . E_S ###Well , we pretty much do , um , plastic milk cartons and , um , um , um , newspapers . E_S 
20820:14	###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Plastic milk cartons , newspapers and cans , and glass , I guess 0 *T*-2 , \[ is the four , \+ is really the four \] things that we do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Like aluminum cans ? E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
20843:53	###I do n't want *-1 to be running down there every week , or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###I know . E_S ###I know . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . ###We 're kind of the same way . E_S ###You know , at first , you know , you , N_S ###at first \[ it was a real , \+ it was a real \] hassle , E_S ###and I 'm wondering are we really going *-1 to do this , E_S 
20871:33	###And they 're impossible 0 *-1 to crush *T*-2 . E_S ###I mean , you ca n't get the down to any size , you know . E_S ###If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag , you know pretty easily , E_S ###so . You know , N_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###I guess 0 we kind of started *-1 recycling after I moved here about a year and a half ago . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###We were using baby food E_S 
20879:22	###SpeakerB44 . ###We were using baby food E_S ###and there was so many baby food jars , kind of what *T*-1 started it . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Some of our neighbors were doing it E_S

21077:37	###SpeakerA43 . ###But , I think 0 there 's enough out there 0 * to pick from *T*-1 . E_S ###I 'm not , N_S ###we do n't have cable to the point \[ of , \+ of \] the H B O or any of that stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB46 . 
21095:57	###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###Oh , me . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###And I watched that for like , oh , ten or fifteen straight years , E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Oh , no . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###and then \[ I had , \+ well , you know , I 'd \] eat N_S ###like at work , we 'd have a T V or whatever . E_S 
21112:39	###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###* Bet 0 they hated that . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###\[ I watched , \+ I had watched \] it since it started . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Oh , goodness . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
21122:34	###Uh , now \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know who the characters are *T*-1 , E_S ###and , um , I 'll turn it on every once in awhile E_S ###and I do n't recognize anybody , E_S ###so I guess 0 that 's a good sign . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Really . E_S ###I used *-1 to watch , uh , N_S ###I can recall , N_S ###this might \[ age me , \+ date me \] here , 
21222:11	###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I need *-1 to get brave . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Yeah . E_S ###* Give them your pen number . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S 
21254:20	###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . ###um , \[ QUANTUM , LEAP has , \+ I mean QUANTUM LEAP is \] kind of a comedy in its own way , I guess 0 *T*-1 , E_S ###but , uh , mostly \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] kind of science fiction , E_S ###and , \[ it 's , \+ um , it 's \] adventure and things like that E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###and then NIGHT COURT is just pure , you know , weird fun , you know , E_S ###\[ just , it 's , \+ it 's \] nothing serious about it at all . E_S 
21305:4	###SpeakerB24 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###And he , you know , was too depressed , you know , *-1 to , N_S ###so that was part of , I guess , his character building or whatever , E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###I think 0 it \[ adds a , \+ probably adds a \] little bit of depth to his character . E_S ###I have n't watched , um N_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
21309:4	###so that was part of , I guess , his character building or whatever , E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###I think 0 it \[ adds a , \+ probably adds a \] little bit of depth to his character . E_S ###I have n't watched , um N_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Which of course he needed *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###yeah , E_S ###I think so , E_S 
21315:31	###Which of course he needed *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###yeah , E_S ###I think so , E_S ###which in QUANTUM LEAP you get *T*-1 N_S ###even though the person is involved in so many other people 's lives , you still see \[ a , \+ a \] real person in those situations . E_S ###\[ He gets , \+ um , he 's \] doing amazing things E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
21324:26	###SpeakerB30 . ###but he 's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S ###that 's a good point , E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###and I think 0 that 's , N_S ###I like that . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
21330:54	###SpeakerB32 . ###and I think 0 that 's , N_S ###I like that . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###So \[ what do you , \+ what do you \] consider *T*-1 your favorite shows ? E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Um , I think 0 my favorite show is HUNTER . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
21342:16	###Dede , E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I agree . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###\[ \[ and , \+ um , so , \] \+ uh , uh , and then \] the blond that they took *T*-1 out , the one that *T*-2 got killed *-3 E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah , E_S 
21349:23	###\[ \[ and , \+ um , so , \] \+ uh , uh , and then \] the blond that they took *T*-1 out , the one that *T*-2 got killed *-3 E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I ca n't remember what her name is *T*-1 , E_S ###but is , N_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###yeah , E_S ###I did n't enjoy her . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I , \] N_S ###she was too much of a opposite of Dede , E_S 
21355:138	###yeah , E_S ###I did n't enjoy her . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I , \] N_S ###she was too much of a opposite of Dede , E_S ###and I think 0 that 's what they try *-2 to do *T*-1 , E_S ###but I think 0 we wanted *-1 to see Dede *ICH*-2 there or somebody like her . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . 
21384:23	###They did n't . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###I mean , they were never partners . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah , E_S ###she would go her way , E_S ###and he would do his , N_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . 
21393:64	###SpeakerB58 . ###and I think 0 that 's what I did n't like *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###\[ \[ And , \+ and , \] \+ and \] \[ even , \+ even \] at the beginning Dede \[ and , \+ and \] Hunter would decide that one of them would go *-1 do this , while the other one \[ would do , \+ would go \] this , E_S ###but , uh , it seemed like it was almost two different organizations you know , E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###like Hunter was the boss , E_S ###and this other girl was not *?* , E_S 
21404:29	###SpeakerB62 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###So , yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] kind of agree with that . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And I like the new lady better , E_S ###but I 'd just as soon that they did n't have the romance there . E_S ###I 'd just as soon have \[ the , \+ the \] police story without all the romance . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . 
21413:16	###SpeakerA65 . ###Well , I 'm afraid 0 that 's what \[ they , \+ they \] really wanted *-1 to do *T*-2 , um , E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 most shows were doing that , E_S ###and then they went away from it E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###and now they 're starting *-1 to go back to it , E_S 
21416:14	###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 most shows were doing that , E_S ###and then they went away from it E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###and now they 're starting *-1 to go back to it , E_S ###and maybe that 's what the public wants *T*-1 , E_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###but \[ I just , \+ I like \] \[ the , \+ the \] cut and dry * solve the mystery , E_S 
21426:40	###and that 's what *ICH*-2 I always enjoyed *T*-1 about it . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , see , there was that spark between Dede and Hunter for a while E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###but \[ they , \+ they \] like started it , E_S ###and then they 'd pull it back , E_S ###and they 'd start it and pull it back . E_S 
21426:70	###and that 's what *ICH*-2 I always enjoyed *T*-1 about it . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , see , there was that spark between Dede and Hunter for a while E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###but \[ they , \+ they \] like started it , E_S ###and then they 'd pull it back , E_S ###and they 'd start it and pull it back . E_S 
21426:133	###and that 's what *ICH*-2 I always enjoyed *T*-1 about it .

21434:18	###and then they 'd pull it back , E_S ###and they 'd start it and pull it back . E_S ###And that really made it a very interesting , uh , show to where you never really knew \[ which , \+ which \] one *T*-1 was going *-6 to show up .

E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###And , \[ that , \+ that \] I kind of thought 0 *T*-1 was good , E_S ###but , um , you know , it 's , I guess 0 *T*-1 , you know , N_S ###you always kind of sit there E_S ###and you see these two people together , E_S 
21438:26	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###And , \[ that , \+ that \] I kind of thought 0 *T*-1 was good , E_S ###but , um , you know , it 's , I guess 0 *T*-1 , you know , N_S ###you always kind of sit there E_S ###and you see these two people together , E_S ###and you always wonder , why they do n't , you know , get together or whatever *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . 
21453:39	###SpeakerB78 . ###\[ and , \+ and , \] N_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###But \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-3 's \] always been a formula , uh , for T V \[ that the minute that two people , \+ that the two main stars \] get married *-1 *T*-4 , that the show ends up , you know , *-2 dying .

E_S ###I 've been watching Nickelodeon all last week , because they had what they called *T*-1 MAXIMUM SMART . E_S ###They had GET SMART for , uh , ten hours a day , from seven o'clock at night , until six or until five o'clock the next morning . All the GET SMART episodes 0 you could ever see *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . 
21469:23	###SpeakerB84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###and \[ that was , \+ I mean , that was \] the killer , E_S ###the series died right after that , because , N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###\[ I did n't , \+ I was going *-1 to say , 0 I did n't \] ever watch MOONLIGHTING , E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###well * go ahead .

21498:68	###SpeakerB96 . ###Halfway through , E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###SpeakerB98 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Um , couple of examples would be , um , well , like I said , this one about \[ Max S- , \+ or Get Well Smart , \] the female character , Barbara Feldon E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . 
21499:18	###Halfway through , E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###SpeakerB98 . ###Yeah .

21514:4	###SpeakerB104 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###It made no sense . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] guess 0 it 's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows N_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Unfortunately , that 's probably true . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###yeah , E_S 
21515:24	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###It made no sense .

21518:47	###SpeakerB106 . ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] guess 0 it 's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows N_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Unfortunately , that 's probably true .

21530:85	###SpeakerB110 . ###I 've seen it before , E_S ###but I do n't watch it regularly . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , \[ I \+ I \] hardly ever watch it , E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###Usually Tuesday nights I 'm out , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA113 . 
21535:98	###well , \[ I \+ I \] hardly ever watch it , E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###Usually Tuesday nights I 'm out , E_S ###so .

E_S ###SpeakerA115 . 
21542:18	###SpeakerB114 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###and I think 0 they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about *T*-1 .

22851:17	###SpeakerB20 . ###and that 's always kind of bothered me . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , I kind of think 0 that 's true , too .

22856:35	###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###that 's like everything else , though . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###I have a sister-in-law who *T*-1 runs a nursing home , E_S ###but I 've never actually been there E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
22903:17	###SpeakerA43 . ###Other things . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###and it *EXP*-1 's hard * to , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . 
22920:21	###in fact there 's a , N_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###I do too . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . ###Outside 's awful deceiving sometimes you know . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . 
22929:47	###SpeakerB56 . ###There 's one close to where my mother is *T*-1 , E_S ###but in order * to get in , you have *-1 to be able *-2 to , um , walk in on your own , E_S ###in other words , you ca n't be in , you know , too bad a shape *-1 to start out with *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . 
22945:43	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###But it 's always , well , N_S ###and they have a long waiting list , too . E_S ###So there 's always this feeling of , well , golly gee , you know , you 've got *-1 to be able *-2 to walk in the door , E_S ###so you ca n't wait until you 're too bad off E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Off , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . 
22981:67	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###but of course , I would never be able *-1 to afford *-2 to put my parents in something like that , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's the problem E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###that 's way out of my reach . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###the expense of it all is , N_S 
22985:11	###Yeah , E_S ###that 's the problem E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###that 's way out of my reach .

E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . 
23006:21	###but \[ \[ I , \+ there 's , \] I think 0 there 's \] ways around it *ICH*-1 , though , that , you know , N_S ###like , they could put it in one of their children 's names or something you know .

E_S ###SpeakerA93 . 
23059:21	###it 's not all bad E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###but I guess 0 once you get ill , then , you know , you really have some problems if you ca n't get around and do things . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Around , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###SpeakerA113 . 
23065:5	###Around , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###SpeakerA113 . ###But I really do n't know what the other solution would be *T*-1 you know , E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###I really do n't . E_S ###But no , E_S 
23075:41	###when the time comes *T*-1 \[ I 'm really , \+ hopefully we 'll really \] look around before I decide on one for my parents E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###* really do , E_S ###because I have been raised *-1 in one , you know , E_S ###so there 's lot of things 0 I know *-1 to look for *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . 
23104:7	###SpeakerA127 . ###And I guess 0 we 'd better get back to work , huh . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###All right . E_S ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
23105:4	###And I guess 0 we 'd better get back to work , huh . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###All right . E_S ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###So what do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S 
23110:21	###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###So what do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S ###How are we doing in recycling *T*-1 ? E_S ###Are we , N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I think 0 we need *-1 to do more . E_S ###I mean , I know 0 I need *-1 to do more . E_S 
23155:22	###but , you know , I get it on , N_S ###I try *-1 to buy , you know , the early edition *ICH*-2 for the coupons , you know , the Sunday edition . E_S ###So . N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###But , then I just , you know , bundle it up and put it on \[ the front , \+ you know , the front \] walk \[ ev- , \+ you know , every \] Monday or every other Monday , and have them pick that up , E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
23157:110	###So . N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###But , then I just , you know , bundle it up and put it on \[ the front , \+ you know , the front \] walk \[ ev- , \+ you know , every \] Monday or every other Monday , and have them pick that up , E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###but that 's the extent of what I 've done *T*-1 . E_S ###I 'd like *-1 to be able *-2 to do more . E_S 
23166:14	###I 'd like *-1 to be able *-2 to do more . E_S ###The problem is , with a lot of it is , 0 \[ you have * to go , \+ \] you know , it takes a while * to drive to these places where you recycle it *T*-1 , you know E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah E_S ###see , and , N_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###it *EXP*-1 's not always convenient * to do it . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###see , and here in Lubbock everything 's so close . E_S 
23169:18	###Yeah E_S ###see , and , N_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###it *EXP*-1 's not always convenient * to do it . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###see , and here in Lubbock everything 's so close . E_S ###I can imagine what it 's like *T*-1 up there . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S 
23206:19	###I did n't want *-1 to buy a plastic one . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah E_S ###because those things I think 0 *T*-1 would just snap you know . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###But Payless Cashways has them E_S ###and they 're metal , E_S 
23287:7	###SpeakerA61 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###and I think 0 they 're just fine . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I bought a , N_S ###I got one *ICH*-1 at work that I bought *T*-2 for one of the guys there at work , E_S ###it 's his birthday , E_S ###we 're pretty good friends , E_S 
23316:16	###I think 0 we 're \[ getting , \+ becoming \] more conscious because we just ca n't stick everything in landfills any more . E_S ###So . N_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###No , E_S ###there 's not going *-1 to be any room , shortly . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###No , E_S ###no , E_S ###the office , N_S ###SpeakerA75 . 
23332:53	###Yeah , E_S ###\[ so . \+ But \] I think 0 we 're getting better at it E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###I think 0 there 's quite a bit more 0 we could do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Girls , * put that away . E_S ###Now . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . 
23371:6	###We tried *-1 to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that I have *T*-2 , E_S ###and we just do n't have any place 0 * to store those kind of cans *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###You know , if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people , sure they 'll save them for us , ###there 's no problem there . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . 
23378:4	###SpeakerB94 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###But what do you do *T*-1 with them in the meantime ? E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Now I do n't want \[ a can , \+ a garage \] full of cans . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###That 's right , E_S 
23491:40	###Really . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###And maybe instead \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , * just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do , maybe we should commit *-1 to spend a week , E_S ###and during that week you 're kind of an ad hoc , * let 's hear about it , group of , I do n't know , twenty-five instead of twelve E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh .

23509:73	###SpeakerB14 . ###But the way 0 \[ our system , \+ our court system \] works *T*-1 , that guy is going *-2 to have *-3 to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###I just think 0 our system is overworked , E_S ###and we 're starting *-1 to stretch the true meaning \[ of , \+ of \] right to a speedy trial .

24612:123	###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###I mean if someone assumed that of me , I would be upset . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it \] would almost be like \[ a , \+ a , \] uh ... N_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###It 's an accusation , E_S 
24617:9	###right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it \] would almost be like \[ a , \+ a , \] uh ... N_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###It 's an accusation , E_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ and \] it 's \+ and it 's \] based *-4 \[ on , \+ on \] a perception \[ that someone has *T*-3 \+ \] as how a drug user would behave *T*-2 when some drug users behave , uh , normal *T*-1 , uh , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . 
24617:25	###right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it \] would almost be like \[ a , \+ a , \] uh ...

E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . 
24629:5	###Right , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I \] do n't , E_S ###\+ \[ the , \+ \] I think \] 0 almost the only way that drug testing can be done *-1 fairly *T*-2 is if it 's across the board \[ from , \+ from \] the janitors to the executive management . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Right . E_S ###I agree with that . E_S Because I know personally myself , 0 I 've been in the same job for three years , E_S ###it will be three years in August E_S ###and I 've already been drug tested *-1 three times . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . 
24665:60	###SpeakerB60 . ###so , see it 's really strange . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###That is odd . E_S ###I was drug tested *-1 , uh , not for the job 0 I have *T*-2 now , but for the prior job , uh , E_S ###but I know \[ that \+ \[ they sent , \+ \] that \] the job 0 I had *T*-1 before , that , well , N_S ###the job 0 I \[ have , \+ have *T*-1 \] now , requested \[ my , \+ uh , uh , my , \] uh , medical record from my old company E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Oh , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . 
24711:21	###all of them are tested *-1 once every three mo- , E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###They 're ... N_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###it 's a rotation . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###But it , N_S 
24723:72	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###The men that *T*-1 are out there *-3 fixing power lines are tested *-2 a lot E_S ###and the men that *T*-1 drive the trucks \[ with , \+ with \] the guys that *T*-2 fix the power lines are n't tested *-3 as much . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###SpeakerB86 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . 
24801:59	###But , of course , people are trapped *-1 economically E_S ###and they ca n't do that . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I know 0 down here the schools are , you know , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###they rate , N_S ###I moved to Arkansas and Texas after *-1 living in Ohio E_S ###and the schools down here rate , you know , *-1 bottom ten percent across the country E_S ###and *-1 having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why . E_S 
24808:4	###I moved to Arkansas and Texas after *-1 living in Ohio E_S ###and the schools down here rate , you know , *-1 bottom ten percent across the country E_S ###and *-1 having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why . E_S ###Because they 're so far behind and so poorly staffed *-2 , half the time the teachers do n't know what *T*-1 's going on . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Well , that 's really too bad because \[ it , \+ it 's \] giving some people unfair advantage . E_S ###I mean \[ we , \+ our \] high school up here is like a junior college in Florida E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . 
24811:5	###Because they 're so far behind and so poorly staffed *-2 , half the time the teachers do n't know what *T*-1 's going on . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Well , that 's really too bad because \[ it , \+ it 's \] giving some people unfair advantage . E_S ###I mean \[ we , \+ our \] high school up here is like a junior college in Florida E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###what we learned *T*-1 . N_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Well , that was my experience * going through junior high up there E_S 
24811:45	###Because they 're so far behind and so poorly staffed *-2 , half the time the teachers do n't know what *T*-1 's going on .

24820:66	###Well , that was my experience * going through junior high up there E_S ###when I came down south for high school *T*-1 I was just repeating what I 'd already done *T*-2 . Because we were so far advanced . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And , uh , you know , I 'd been in a parochial school before junior high E_S ###and , you know , even the public schools are behind the parochial schools . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
24834:111	###SpeakerA19 . ###Like they have that *ICH*-1 down there that , N_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Well , they talk about it E_S ###and there are a few in some of the more , like in N_S ###I live in a big Metroplex E_S ###and some of \[ the , \+ the \] better parts of the Metroplex , \[ the , \+ the \] suburbs that *T*-1 are richer have those kind of target schools . E_S ###But , uh , you know , N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah , E_S 
24854:7	###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###I was fortunate . E_S ###\[ I 'm a , \+ I 'm a \] technician E_S ###and we had a vocational , uh , electronics in our high school . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Right , E_S ###in high school . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
24860:16	###SpeakerB26 . ###Right , E_S ###in high school . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###So when I went to my first year of tech school *T*-1 , I had a very easy time because our high school had \[ a , \+ a \] good program . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###I think 0 the schools today , you know , \[ the public schools are just , \+ they 're just \] overrun *-1 , you know , E_S 
24885:14	###but if *-2 do n't work with them as a parent , I think 0 *T*-1 you 're putting your child at a big disadvantage . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and , you know , there 's some kids that , you know , *T*-1 want *-2 to go *-3 learn , E_S ###but most of them just want *-1 to go *-2 play . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well \[ I could , \+ I could \] see 0 if a kid does n't have any encouragement if , \[ t- , \+ they 're , \] you know , come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about *-1 trying *-2 to work E_S ###\[ and , \+ or \] maybe they 're unemployed E_S ###and they 're mad at the world , E_S 
24909:60	###are they going *-1 to move to , uh Mexico ? E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh , I do n't know about that , E_S ###but a lot of the industry up in , uh , you know , the northern states is moving south E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
24948:16	###I just think 0 \[ \[ it , \+ it 's , \] \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] a duty of the parent * to do that .

E_S ###I can see some lady , E_S ###she 's twenty-one years old E_S ###and she 's got four kids . E_S ###A kid in , N_S ###her first grader , N_S

27777:45	###I was born *-1 in fifty E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Okay , E_S ###\[ we , \+ we 're \] very similarly aged , E_S ###so we probably have an \[ in- , \+ interesting \] perspective on the music on the times , E_S ###so I 'm just a couple years older than you , E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah .

27779:37	###SpeakerB4 . ###Okay , E_S ###\[ we , \+ we 're \] very similarly aged , E_S ###so we probably have an \[ in- , \+ interesting \] perspective on the music on the times , E_S ###so I 'm just a couple years older than you , E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###um , essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which *T*-1 meant that \[ I , \+ for one reason or another I \] did n't pay much attention to music , E_S ###but as I look back now I realize 0 it was very formative for me , E_S 
27779:55	###SpeakerB4 . ###Okay , E_S ###\[ we , \+ we 're \] very similarly aged , E_S ###so we probably have an \[ in- , \+ interesting \] perspective on the music on the times , E_S ###so I 'm just a couple years older than you , E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah .

27795:11	###Uh , over time I became very interested \[ in , \+ in \] baroque classical E_S ###and I think 0 that was just through * experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found \[ it , \+ it \] very relaxing for me . E_S ###My tastes now run I guess 0 *T*-1 to a upbeat , uh , Simon , N_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###it 's something that *T*-1 interests me , uh , combined \[ with , \+ with \] the classical tastes 0 I had mentioned *T*-2 . E_S ###And my classical music tends *-1 to be confined *-2 to the seventeen hundreds , early eighteen hundred music . E_S ###I 'm not a music , um , N_S MUMBLEx , ###I 'm not particularly schooled in it . E_S 
27805:37	###I know what I like *-1 to listen to *T*-2 as far as classical music . E_S ###And \[ I , \+ I \] spent a good deal of time *-1 listening also to , uh , people from the late seventies , really , um , Neil Diamond , for instance . Um , people \[ of , \+ of \] that particular time , E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###That 's kind of the way 0 I am *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###I listen to some country and western E_S ###but I 'm not \[ sch- , \+ schooled \] in it E_S 
27810:7	###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###I listen to some country and western E_S ###but I 'm not \[ sch- , \+ schooled \] in it E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I 've \] enjoyed the times when I have listened to it *T*-1 .

27810:76	###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh .

27820:52	###but when I do play , uh , and begin *-4 to reacquire skills *T*-5 I inevitably fall in love with country western music which *T*-1 tends *-2 to be in some ways easy 0 * to play *T*-3 \[ for a , \+ for a \] new piano player . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###\[ It is , \+ it 's \] got , uh , basically an easy , uh , rhythm \[ and , \+ and \] tone . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###And \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \[ pretty , \+ fairly \] well easily \[ to \+ uh , uh , something 0 * to \] fall into *T*-1 . E_S ###I 'm kind of the say way , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I 've \] gone through different periods of life , uh , in music from pop to classical . E_S ###I guess 0 one of the things \[ was \+ \] that *T*-1 influenced me was that \[ I , \+ I 've \] worked in radio stations as a D J for all my college years *-2 trying *-3 to support my way through there , E_S and suppor- , N_S was support , N_S

E_S ###And I 've developed a real love for , uh , classical music in , probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was , uh , heavy into classical type music . E_S ###He said 0 he used *-1 to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just *-3 to hear the music , uh , that they were using *T*-2 behind them because they used , especially Disney used *RNR*-4 a lot of classical music , uh , behind the cartoons E_S ###and so consequently we \[ wind up , \+ wound up \] *-1 playing a lot of classical music there E_S ###and I think 0 that , uh , got deep seated into me . E_S 
27839:16	###Chicago had some things , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###uh , and I think 0 even Electric Light Orchestra had \[ some , \+ some \] real , um , influences by classical music E_S ###and I 'm \[ still , \+ still , \] N_S ###my favorite , N_S ###in fact most of my C D -s are classical music . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###I find it *EXP*-2 very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy *T*-1 I particularly like the music . E_S 
27861:90	###uh , and I , I 've , uh , THIRTY SOMETHING I 'm particularly interested , E_S ###but it 's the music *ICH*-1 , almost that I find myself listening to *T*-2 , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . ###I 'm kind of thinking 0 that 's maybe , N_S ###our generation was , uh , so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness *ICH*-2 with , uh , things now with the music that *T*-1 's behinds them .

27895:23	###SpeakerB40 . ###that 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###When did you first take your , uh , first piano lesson *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh , probably about first grade , E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###and I have , uh , returned about every four or five years to *-2 thinking that I would like *-1 to do something about it . E_S

27927:29	###uh , but \[ in a , \+ in a \] innate music sense there just seems *-1 to be something missing * there which *T*-2 is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude E_S ###and I keep *-2 thinking , gee , I thought that all the math and music people are supposed *-1 to go hand in hand E_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] it does n't for me .

27978:38	###SpeakerA71 . ###Good-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###So well , \[ you 're , \+ \[ you , \+ you \] take \] this subject much more personally than I do , I suppose 0 *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###well , * take it back , thirty years N_S 
27997:127	###And if you really pushed it , you taught until you had kids or something you know , E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###\[ if you had , \+ if you were \] a teacher .

28007:53	###\[ There was not , \+ there 's not \] supposed *-1 to be any reason 0 * to use this education or this brain that you might have *T*-2 for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be *T*-3 on any given day *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###\[ And then , \+ and then \] of course today it 's supposed *-1 to be all the other way .

E_S ###SpeakerA16 . 
28015:16	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] we have these wonderful people \[ who *T*-1 are \+ who *T*-2 are \] totally prepared *-3 \[ to tea- , \+ to teach \] your child everything 0 they need *-4 to know *T*-5 in day care E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh-huh .

28051:40	###and , N_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###So it was you and the kid E_S ###and your work schedule is . N_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Well that 's the thing , see , you know , E_S ###maybe if you get along E_S ###for example if you 'd been a technician instead of an engineer . E_S 
28067:10	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###But if you 're going *-1 to be more professional oriented , then you 've got *-2 to have this , * to be able *-3 to perform well on the job E_S you 've got *-4 to have the flexibility that *T*-5 does n't really go with the family . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and so it was , N_S ###in my case , I just , uh , decided that , as long as my kids were little , I would be better off at home with them , instead of *-3 driving myself crazy *-1 trying *-2 to do everything at once . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###So you figure 0 one of these days you 're going *-1 to go back to *-2 being an engineer ? E_S 
28071:4	###Yeah , E_S ###and so it was , N_S ###in my case , I just , uh , decided that , as long as my kids were little , I would be better off at home with them , instead of *-3 driving myself crazy *-1 trying *-2 to do everything at once . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###So you figure 0 one of these days you 're going *-1 to go back to *-2 being an engineer ? E_S ###Is that what you 're saying *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###Well , actually I 've found out that I 'm not going *-1 to go back to *-2 being an engineer . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . 
28080:7	###SpeakerB41 . ###What will you , N_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###\[ \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] a photographer now . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Oh , okay , E_S ###you 've found something else . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###\[ I have , \+ I have \] branched out . E_S ###I was a photographer before , E_S 
28106:159	###I mean , you figure 0 there 's got *-1 to be more to life than * sitting here playing with this child . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] great while they 're really little , E_S ###but as they get older and they 're more independent , and there 's things 0 * to do *T*-1 , then it *EXP*-2 's good for them to go to different , N_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###I mean , \[ it , \+ he \] goes to \[ a , \+ a \] mother 's day out program now once a week . E_S ###Both of my kids do , E_S 
28150:12	###SpeakerB67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###because , I liked my job really well . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###But I was just pulled *-1 in so many different directions E_S ###\[ I was , \+ it was \] just driving me crazy .

28165:48	###SpeakerB73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###SpeakerB75 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###SpeakerB77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###So my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week , E_S 
28177:128	###Yeah , E_S ###so jobs have *-1 to , I guess , become more flexible . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###I think 0 they 're really going *-1 to have *-2 to *?* , ###\[ and not , \+ and not \] just for mothers , for fathers as well . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###It 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be both . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . 
28226:11	###SpeakerB99 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###I know 0 that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if I wanted my husband to do something *-1 to help , and even though we were both working the same number of hours , \[ and , \+ and \] doing things , I had *-2 to come in there specifically and say this needs *-3 to be done *-4 , E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###Uh-huh .

28255:37	###SpeakerB111 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA112 . ###SpeakerB113 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA114 . ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB115 .

28279:47	###and , uh .

33011:49	###uh , I have one recipe for , uh , a really good , um , type of a meatball .

E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###um E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] really good E_S 
33040:30	###SpeakerA17 . ###But if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like , uh , N_S ###\[ shrimp , \+ shrimp \] fettucini is real easy * to , um , make and everything E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###and it 's usually well liked *-1 by people , I guess 0 *T*-2 , E_S ###I 'm just a seafood fan E_S ###so , I think on the lines of , N_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
33061:17	###I mean , well , you eat them *-1 dead E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###* Do n't buy them *-1 that way . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###Because \[ if , \+ if \] they are dead for too long , N_S 
33088:47	###But , um , you just put some Cajun , well , lots of pepper E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh .

33318:31	###I do n't know if we have enough time for it E_S ###SpeakerA153 . ###Oh E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###it 's real easy E_S ###one of the unique things in this it 's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings E_S ###you can just light N_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerB156 . 
33341:5	###and that adds something new to it E_S ###And then the sauce is just made *-1 with um bouillion cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour E_S ###SpeakerA163 . ###Um-hum E_S ###SpeakerB164 . ###SpeakerA165 . ###Oh E_S ###SpeakerB166 . ###So \[ it 's not a \+ it 's not a \] thick rich type of a sauce E_S ###it 's more of a N_S

33603:60	###Well , I like aerobics , E_S ###but I 'm not so sure that , N_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Well not that much , though .

33695:18	###SpeakerA81 . ###That 's probably the safer way E_S ###because I notice 0 in aerobics a lot of the women that *T*-1 do n't look like they should n't be doing certain things E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Uh-huh .

33952:12	###SpeakerA163 . ###Okay , E_S ###* thank you , Sandy . E_S ###SpeakerB164 . ###Sure , E_S ###thanks . E_S ###SpeakerA165 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
33955:60	###SpeakerB164 . ###Sure , E_S ###thanks . E_S ###SpeakerA165 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Uh , well what would you say 0 your opinion *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 on gun control ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I do n't know . E_S 
33964:9	###Well , I do n't know . E_S ###\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] had mixed emotions *ICH*-4 , I guess 0 *T*-3 , when I listen to , uh , the radio \[ and , \+ and \] watch T V *T*-2 about the different , uh , things that *T*-1 are happening . E_S ###Uh , I 'm against it E_S ###but on the same token , uh , I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right * to do that . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Ye- , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###So \[ I , \+ I \] have a rifle in the house . E_S ###Uh , the ammunition is probably so old 0 I 'm afraid *-1 to use it . E_S ###But , uh , I bought it for target practicing \[ and , \+ uh , and \] also because I wanted a weapon . E_S 
33988:42	###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh , I do n't know if I 'll ever use it , you know . E_S ###And like you , my bullets to my little pistol 's probably , uh , about three years old . E_S ###Uh , my gun has n't been shot *-1 in a year or two . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###But , uh , I like *-1 to have them \[ where \+ \] handy . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . 
34027:4	###And you can get them really cheap . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###I know E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in , uh , Tennessee . And , uh , they had a waiting period E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###and , uh , we bought it there . E_S ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
34037:134	###How long was the waiting period out there *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###About nine days . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Huh . E_S ###That was n't \[ too , \+ too \] bad . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###No . E_S ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
34064:85	###But I do n't know , uh , E_S ###I think 0 you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###No , E_S ###a shotgun 's got too much of a spread . E_S ###Or at least ours does . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh , it 's , you know , N_S 
34123:16	###You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have , uh , competition . E_S ###Uh , I 've never really joined a club because I have n't got the time . Not because I have n't got the desire . E_S ###Uh , there 's an annual membership fee , uh , \[ that 's , \+ that *T*-1 's \] fairly high . E_S ###Plus there 's \[ ini- , \+ an initiation \] fee that you have *-1 to pay *T*-2 because of first time , uh , uh , member . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###SpeakerB62 . ###So the whole process *ICH*-2 can cost you a hundred fifty dollars * to join the club . E_S ###Plus you have *-1 to pay for \[ the , \+ the \] ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah . E_S 
34142:42	###I think \[ that , \+ that \] the gun clubs serve a useful purpose . E_S ###In fact , I 'd like *-1 to see 0 somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon *T*-2 you have * to , uh , show that you 've gone to school or gone to some class * to know how * to handle that weapon *T*-3 . N_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###That 's a good , N_S ###I 've never thought of that . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###That 's a good point . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###And , you know , \[ it , \+ it , \] N_S 
34142:114	###I think \[ that , \+ that \] the gun clubs serve a useful purpose . E_S ###In fact , I 'd like *-1 to see 0 somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon *T*-2 you have * to , uh , show that you 've gone to school or gone to some class * to know how * to handle that weapon *T*-3 .

34168:16	###He was fortunate . E_S ###\[ He could , \+ he could \] of hit something else . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Well , he went *-1 tumbling down the steps along with , uh , *-1 shooting his foot almost off . E_S ###He broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things I 'm sure , *-1 being , Mister Cowboy . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###SpeakerB78 . ###SpeakerA79 . 
34177:4	###SpeakerA79 . ###I ca n't remember what \[ the na- , \+ the term *ICH*-1 \] was *T*-2 going around . E_S ###It was about four or five years ago . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###SpeakerA81 . ###But . ###Now , I guess 0 that would be a good idea . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###About , uh , private citizens selling a weapons ? E_S ###Like if you wanted *-1 to sell your pistol to me . E_S 
34186:11	###Like if you wanted *-1 to sell your pistol to me . E_S ###How do you feel about that *T*-1 ? E_S ###Do you believe 0 there ought *-1 to be legislation guiding the , uh , buyer and the seller ? E_S ###\[ And , \+ or \] do you believe that you ought *-1 to be able *-1 to sell your system , uh , because you own it ? E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###SpeakerB84 . ###SpeakerA85 . ###Uh , that 's a hard one because we did that . E_S ###But , uh , I think 0 there ought *-1 to be some rule against it . E_S ###I 'll , uh , you know , N_S 
34212:25	###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Is it registered *-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I- , N_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###\[ The , \+ uh , the \] rifle that I 've got *T*-1 is not registered *-2 , E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###SpeakerB98 . 
34243:76	###I guess 0 that could happen . E_S ###It 's just like \[ the , \+ uh , the \] social security system . E_S ###Once \[ they , \+ uh , they \] gave everybody a number E_S ###and now they 're making you , uh , uh , get one \[ at , \+ at \] birth . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###SpeakerB108 . ###And once they have your number , they have your identification . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB110 .

34334:57	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###You know . And I 'm sure 0 it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun .

34342:34	###I mean regulation . E_S ###Control is something that I would n't want the Federal government to have *T*-1 . E_S ###Uh , but I would like *-1 to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who *T*-2 has what weapons . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , I agree with you there . E_S ###They do have too much control over us already . E_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA145 .

35127:64	###Stuff I guess *T*-2 that *T*-1 mostly public , on public T V . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###Right .

35178:13	###SpeakerA100 . ###I 'll sit down for the big games , the Super Bowl , and the championship you know , things like that . E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###Yeah .

35193:25	###SpeakerA106 . ###SpeakerB107 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] enjoy that , E_S ###but \[ \[ what do you , \+ where do you \] \+ do you \] get that come- .

E_S ###SpeakerB109 . ###You do n't have cable now , E_S ###I was going *-1 to say 0 they have a comedy channel now .

35271:10	###Yeah , E_S ###we try *-1 to stay up , too . E_S ###SpeakerA134 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB135 . ###It 's getting harder and harder .

35282:35	###I think 0 it 's come around again . E_S ###It 's gone through cycles . E_S ###SpeakerB137 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it was , N_S ###we stopped *-1 watching for a couple of years in the middle there , E_S ###but we started *-1 watching again . E_S ###SpeakerA138 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB139 . 
35288:22	###but we started *-1 watching again . E_S ###SpeakerA138 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB139 . ###But it 's real different show than it was *?* when it started *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA140 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB141 . ###It 's funny now , E_S ###and it 's better , E_S 
35335:8	###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB157 . ###* Take care . E_S ###SpeakerA158 . ###You too . E_S ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerB159 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S 
35439:7	###Oh no . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Those things go fast . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh , of course \[ we 're not , \+ we ca n't \] consider *-1 getting a brand new Cadillac , because those are twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
35447:12	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###But when they 're three years old *T*-1 they 're , N_S ###the price already drops in half . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###So then it becomes , uh , more realistic . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S 
35455:94	###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S ###That 's what I 'm thinking about *T*-1 on my next car is do I want *-2 to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . 
35481:30	###but if you 've narrowed it down to one or two you can have the car , uh , uh , checked *-1 at , uh , an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong , because they do n't have any financial interest in it . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . 
35484:7	###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###And then you 'll have a realistic assessment of what you 're getting *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
35518:10	###SpeakerA79 . ###Yes , E_S ###I do n't want *-1 to think about *-2 buying a car for a while . E_S ###I just want *-1 to enjoy *-2 not having any car payments for a while and enjoy *-2 watching my savings account get larger and , uh , you know , hang on to the one 0 I 've got *T*-3 for a few years because \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] almost four years old , E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###but it 's still in great shape . E_S ###I have a Mazda R X seven . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . 
35522:7	###SpeakerB80 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###but it 's still in great shape . E_S ###I have a Mazda R X seven . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Well , what you can do *T*-1 is * take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . 
35546:29	###\[ I , \+ I \] would think 0 that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Could you hold on for just a moment ? E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Okay . E_S ###I 'm on a cordless phone , E_S ###and I was picking up , uh , some background noise , E_S ###so I just switched the channel *ICH*-1 up on it . E_S 
35625:5	###\[ So , \+ but , \] uh , it runs fine , E_S ###all 0 you hav- , N_S ###it 's just very thirsty . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###If I just keep the oil in , it seems *-1 to be okay . E_S ###But , you know , that 's a sign that I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to do something sooner or later . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###Right . E_S 
35660:5	###SpeakerA139 . ###That 's probably the best thing . E_S ###SpeakerB140 . ###You lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in . E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###Or maybe more than that , as I 've learned . E_S ###SpeakerB142 . ###Oh really . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###Yeah . E_S 
35674:4	###Oh there you go . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###You can do much better . E_S ###I 'm glad 0 \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] taking care of it yourself . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 * trading it in , they just use that as additional , N_S ###they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car 0 you 're buying *T*-1 , E_S ###but they just , are going *-1 to give you that much less for your trade in . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###Well that 's fact . E_S ###SpeakerA147 . 
35686:29	###SpeakerB148 . ###I think 0 you 're right . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###But strangely enough , \[ the best off- , \+ I mean , the best bargaining \] 0 I had made *T*-1 with a dealer on my car was also the same place 0 I got the best price trade in *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerB150 . ###Interesting . E_S ###SpeakerA151 . ###but it 's a place in Arlington , E_S ###and I think , 0 maybe , as you get outside the Dallas area , E_S ###I kind of , N_S 
35698:21	###plus I was going through that T I fleet discount program . E_S ###SpeakerB152 . ###Okay , E_S ###\[ did , \+ did \] you use it at the car shop place . E_S ###SpeakerA153 . ###Well , it 's before they had that . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###I had gone over to Texins E_S

35703:8	###Well , it 's before they had that . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###I had gone over to Texins E_S ###and they had a little file where they said which dealers *T*-1 participated \[ in the , \+ in the \] fleet program *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerB156 . ###That 's right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . 
35715:105	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA159 . ###SpeakerB160 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA161 . ###So , I figured out a price based on that . E_S ###SpeakerB162 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's good . E_S ###SpeakerA163 . 
35733:7	###SpeakerB168 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA169 . ###SpeakerB170 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA171 . ###He said , You 're going *-1 to get a car that *T*-2 's got flood damage or hail damage .

35748:18	###So it was that same car . E_S ###SpeakerB174 . ###My gosh . E_S ###SpeakerA175 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , unless you 're selling car with hail damage and flood damage , I got the car off your lot for that price . E_S ###SpeakerB176 . ###And you laughed all the way to the bank . E_S ###SpeakerA177 . ###Oh I did . E_S 
35761:29	###SpeakerA179 . ###and , uh , that they required you to do *T*-1 . E_S ###And I took it to Town North , E_S ###and sure enough I saw that guy , E_S ###and he recognized me . E_S ###SpeakerB180 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA181 . ###He said , Oh , hi , Dana , E_S ###and he kind of looked down and saw that car , E_S

36281:16	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA179 . ###SpeakerB180 . ###That 's about right . E_S ###SpeakerA181 . ###Gosh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###well , back to the original subject , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I think 0 youngsters ought *-1 to go out and do some public service , E_S 
36324:5	###I exercise pretty regularly . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###I lift weights quite a bit . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Um , I run occasionally . E_S ###* Let 's see 
36373:26	###so that is a good exercise for that . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it *EXP*-2 's nice * to do it together , too , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###My husband and I use *-1 to walk together , E_S ###but our schedules do n't coincide as well as they used *-1 to *?* , E_S ###and so , we very seldom get together *-1 to walk E_S 
36390:23	###SpeakerA27 . ###We used *-1 to try and belong to clubs or the Y , stuff like that , E_S ###but it *EXP*-3 was so difficult * to go on a regular basis , to drive the distance 0 you have *-1 to go *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###* Save the fees , N_S ###we 've , uh , just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
36402:38	###Yeah , E_S ###I 've got a weight bench , E_S ###and we got my wife an exercise bike , E_S ###and I use that sometimes too . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###It 's a little more convenient , E_S ###but , \[ you 're , \+ I guess 0 you 're \] not as dedicated if you do n't drive over *-1 to do it . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . 
36434:5	###and I think 0 you really have *-1 to *?* , at least twice a week , just *-3 to maintain the shape that you 're in *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###With the walking , I think 0 they said 0 *T*-2 you need *-1 to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###And \[ we , \+ I have two friends , that we \] walk *T*-1 . E_S ###They have babies that *T*-1 are about the same ages \[ as , \+ as \] mine , E_S ###and we 've been walking every morning \[ at , \+ \] going E_S 
36438:19	###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###And \[ we , \+ I have two friends , that we \] walk *T*-1 . E_S ###They have babies that *T*-1 are about the same ages \[ as , \+ as \] mine , E_S ###and we 've been walking every morning \[ at , \+ \] going E_S ###when it was cold *T*-1 we would go to the mall because you ca n't take the babies out very easily . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
36440:21	###SpeakerB46 . ###And \[ we , \+ I have two friends , that we \] walk *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###So \[ we , \+ when we \] go *T*-1 , we \[ have about , \+ do about \] fifteen miles a week , E_S ###but the last little while , for one reason or another , we have n't been real consistent . E_S 
36444:38	###when it was cold *T*-1 we would go to the mall because you ca n't take the babies out very easily . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###So it 's a little harder when you 're depending on other people 0 *T*-3 to do it with you *T*-2 because you have *-1 to meet their schedules as well , E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . 
36488:24	###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###\[ Maybe it , \+ maybe it \] speeded up the process and all that . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Well I think 0 it made parts of it a lot easier . E_S ###\[ And , \+ and \] is this your first that you 're having *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Oh , okay , E_S 
36535:16	###it 's too much work . E_S ###But there 's a lot of different things 0 you can do *T*-2 that *T*-3 are enjoyable that you do n't have *-1 to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###SpeakerB76 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like , Well I 've done a good job because I \[ got , \+ worked \] myself to that point . E_S ###But I guess that you do n't want *-1 to overdo . E_S ###But , well have we reached our limit ? E_S 
36664:16	###and that 's just about as bad as a kid . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah , E_S ###boy , he does n't go in and out of the tent a hundred times .

36946:65	###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###I believe 0 Communism is very much waning .

37584:13	###SpeakerB56 . ###Well is that a good indicator ? E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###\[ That , \+ well it \] can be *?* .

37608:22	###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah .

41605:8	###SpeakerA22 . ###Uh-huh .

41647:11	###SpeakerA36 . ###Well there are mini skirts ###and there are mini skirts . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###There are some that *T*-1 are really short E_S ###and then there are some that *T*-1 may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee .

41662:28	###SpeakerA42 . ###SpeakerB43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###Now , I also , uh , N_S ###even though I retired from education , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] do modeling E_S ###and I teach at a modeling agency here . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA46 .

41685:33	###SpeakerB53 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA54 . ###But , uh , the mini skirt many times will evoke comments 0 you do n't really want *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Right .

41708:24	###again maybe because I was at the school , there were still many teachers who *T*-2 wore mini skirts , E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Uh-huh .

41712:154	###uh , we had no regulation against it E_S ###and a lot of the kids did of course , E_S ###and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###Because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . 
41741:42	###SpeakerA76 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###but I can be professional too .

41765:39	###SpeakerA86 . ###So I was always fighting against the idea of * looking tailored or manish , E_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###Right .

41767:7	###SpeakerB87 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA88 . ###uh , and people would never , ever guess that I was Phys Ed E_S ###\[ and , \+ um , and \] that pleased me , E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###Uh-huh .

41782:83	###SpeakerB93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA94 . ###And , so , uh , uh , I just feel that , uh , you know each person has *-1 to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort . E_S ###SpeakerB95 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA96 . ###But , uh , there are certain norms that companies should be able * to , uh , put *T*-1 out as guidelines for their employees . E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Right , E_S 
41787:103	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA96 . ###But , uh , there are certain norms that companies should be able * to , uh , put *T*-1 out as guidelines for their employees . E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Right , E_S ###that 's \[ what I , \+ one thing 0 I \] like *T*-2 about T I is that they are n't overly strict about what you wear *T*-3 E_S ###and \[ they do n't , \+ you know , your boss does n't \] come up to you and say now * remember , tomorrow you have a meeting ###so you 'd better wear a suit . E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###SpeakerB99 . 
41814:51	###SpeakerA108 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB109 . ###and I think 0 that 's good because it does allow people to be individual E_S ###and it allows you to kind of dress the way 0 you feel *T*-1 that day . E_S ###SpeakerA110 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB111 . ###Or , you know , if you want *-1 to be comfortable and casual you can *?* , E_S 
41819:22	###and it allows you to kind of dress the way 0 you feel *T*-1 that day . E_S ###SpeakerA110 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB111 . ###Or , you know , if you want *-1 to be comfortable and casual you can *?* , E_S ###and sometimes I think 0 you may be more productive if you 're comfortable with what you 're wearing *T*-1 and can \[ \[ be , \+ be , \] \+ feel \] more relaxed . ###Whereas , uh , sometimes when you 're in the suit and feel , kind of almost stiff and \[ you 're not , \+ you know , maybe you \[ do n't , \+ uh , ca n't \] \] get as comfortable *-2 to sit down *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA112 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB113 . 
41825:56	###Whereas , uh , sometimes when you 're in the suit and feel , kind of almost stiff and \[ you 're not , \+ you know , maybe you \[ do n't , \+ uh , ca n't \] \] get as comfortable *-2 to sit down *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA112 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB113 . ###and , you know , like when I 'm writing training material *T*-1 , I prefer *-2 to be more comfortable unless I know 0 I have *-3 to meet with a customer later during the day . E_S ###SpeakerA114 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB115 . ###So , \[ that 's \+ I think , 0 that is \] good that they 're like that . E_S 
41838:89	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB117 . ###and \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] quite agree with that . E_S ###SpeakerA118 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , I do n't either . E_S ###Fortunately I do n't have *-1 to work in those companies . E_S ###SpeakerB119 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA120 . 
41885:51	###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , Deanna , uh , E_S ###on capital punishment in our state , they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman , E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Right , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
41960:31	###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###And he said 0 he 's had his house broken into *-2 and windows smashed *-1 and his car stolen *-3 three times and everything , * trying *-4 to \[ ge- , \+ keep \] him quiet , E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh .

44662:92	###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###I mean she really could pick up on my mood uh , the way 0 I walked in the door *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###It was , uh , uncanny . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Huh .

44668:15	###SpeakerB60 . ###It was , uh , uncanny . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Huh . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think , uh , 0 in a way we 're able *-2 to read each other pretty well because , uh , she knows when I 'm upset *T*-1 and I know when she 's not feeling good *T*-3 too .

44680:226	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh , \[ and , \+ and , \] you know , some people might not believe that E_S ###\[ \[ but , \+ but , \] \+ but , \] uh , I do . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Sure . E_S ###Oh , absolutely . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . 
44694:28	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###That 's the way , N_S ###well , I had that cat that I mentioned *T*-1 , Alfie .

E_S ###Well , for some reason during the night , the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . 
44726:64	###and , uh , she stayed there for one day E_S ###and the doctor called me up and said , uh , 0 she had a low white cell count and that , uh , \[ she was n't , \+ she was \] dying and , uh , suggested that I take her to a \[ \[ working hos- , \+ dog hospital , \] \+ animal hospital \] .

E_S ###Well , she ended *-1 staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care . E_S ###It cost me over five hundred dollars . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Ouch . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . 
44731:19	###Well , she ended *-1 staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care . E_S ###It cost me over five hundred dollars . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Ouch . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Plus , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ uh , the \] vet sent me a bill for what he did *T*-1 E_S ###and , uh , then she recouped . E_S ###She was okay for a couple of years . E_S ###And then she got sick on me again E_S ###and I brought her to a different vet this time E_S 
44743:160	###and she was okay E_S ###and she 's been okay every since . E_S ###It 's been about two years now . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Huh . ###Well , that 's great , E_S ###it really is *?* . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] glad that she was able *-1 to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , \[ the , \+ see the \] problem is 0 \[ \[ if , \+ if the , \] \+ if someone \] would have came up to me and said it 's going *-1 to cost you five hundred dollars *-2 to keep your dog alive . E_S What do you want *-1 to do *T*-2 ? E_S I probably would have had second thoughts . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Of course , you would *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . 
44751:50	###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###You do n't know that , uh , you know . E_S 
44780:16	###SpeakerA95 . ###And , uh , you know , she just brought the cat in because he was n't feeling good . E_S ###So \[ that \+ that \] was kind of a surprise E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Really . E_S ###Geez . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###At lea- , E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Yeah . E_S 
44827:4	###And you take care . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###SpeakerA115 . ###Bye now . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###Maybe we 'll talk again sometimes . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###Okay . E_S 
44854:16	###SpeakerA3 . ###I think 0 it 's somewhere really close to that cause I think 0 a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going *-1 to make that much difference . E_S ###And they really do n't listen to any of the issues anymore . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked , you know ?

44871:53	###I mean that 's the only , thing that I can figure *T*-2 out because I 've heard so many people say well I 'm not going on voting on that one , you know , ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] going *-1 to go *-3 fishing today . ###Or it wo n't make any difference \[ if , \+ if \] I do n't vote E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###and I think 0 it does .

44906:4	###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###But it *ICH*-2 's going *-1 to take at least a whole generation of people , uh , * to get across the idea of voting .

44996:97	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###And I hear so many people saying well I wish 0 this would change , ###I wish that E_S ###\[ and , \+ you know , but \] they did n't go *-1 vote . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . 
45029:139	###Uh , and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first , second or third grade .

45061:23	###You know a good \[ i- , \+ idea \] for the young kids like that too , is * to have like \[ a \+ a \] mock one .

45061:36	###You know a good \[ i- , \+ idea \] for the young kids like that too , is * to have like \[ a \+ a \] mock one .

E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###If they did something like that and started kids out *-3 real young and showed them , okay now you 're not going *-1 to get *-2 to vote E_S 
45078:76	###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###they would understand probably by the time 0 they were in high school *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Right .

45095:128	###SpeakerB100 . ###and you do that in the primary . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Uh , and I do n't know that , uh , a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason . E_S ###Uh , they can declare anything 0 they want *T*-1 E_S ###and they can actually rig it . E_S ###If they really wanted *-1 to vote Republican , they could go in the primary and say 0 they were voting Democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat *T*-2 . E_S ###But , uh , \[ it 's , \+ uh , it 's \] just a sad situation E_S 
45105:39	###and , uh , I do think 0 more needs *-2 to be done *-3 along that line * to help * to , uh , teach the \[ people , \+ uh , uh , everyone , \] uh , more about what *T*-1 is going on with voting and with nonvoting .

45116:18	###SpeakerB108 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###I mean , you know , it would have *-1 to be a child that *T*-2 is just coming into school .

45129:143	###SpeakerB112 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###They thought 0 that was funny . E_S ###Ah , she do n't even know how , wah , wah . E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Right . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###So there was n't any way 0 I was going *-1 to go in there and vote *T*-2 . E_S

46812:39	###well , when I bought my car *T*-1 , it was right out of college E_S ###and , uh , you know , I always been looking for something sporty E_S ###and I ended up *-2 getting , you know , basically something that I could , you know , afford *T*-1 .

46964:40	###SpeakerB118 . ###so , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] very authentic E_S ###and there only is supposed *-1 to be limited edition ###so it \[ may be , \+ may be \] a good investment .

46995:34	###SpeakerA129 . ###Now , see , \[ I would have never figured that , \+ ###I would have figured that \] to be a lot more than that for something that *T*-2 's limited edition . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Well , I do n't know , E_S ###I think 0 the demand 's gone all , down a little bit . E_S ###I think 0 you can , E_S ###the prices are n't as high , you know , E_S ###and \[ the , \+ the \] \[ mu- , \+ \] Miata was first introduced *-1 , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA131 . 
47022:19	###SpeakerA139 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB140 . ###but I , N_S ###they 're still pretty much in demand . E_S ###I think 0 there 's another car coming in , E_S ###it 's supposed *-1 to come out and compete with that Miata , E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB142 . 
47118:22	###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerB174 . ###I just made my first job hop about eight months ago , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA175 . ###uh ... E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###All right . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###What about you , E_S 
47184:17	###so , I went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear E_S ###and , uh , you know , I still do it once in a while .

E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . 
47219:33	###SpeakerB34 . ###The way 0 it works *T*-1 .

47291:36	###I mean , it 's just beautiful .

47312:36	###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###I 'll bet .

48003:55	###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###oh , I started out with college and then went to high school E_S ###and then I preferred the high school age level much better than I did the college , because you have a closer relationship with the , uh , students , that , N_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Oh , did you ? E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . 
48069:92	###it was his responsibility E_S ###and he never ever thought of , uh , *-1 not going to school he said 0 *T*-2 , in view of the fact that he was certain 0 I had a hot line to his school .

48080:47	###SpeakerA89 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###SpeakerA91 . ###SpeakerB92 . ###and I would n't have checked on him .

E_S ###SpeakerB94 . 
48087:19	###SpeakerA93 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Uh , I listened to more than one parent say I do n't know what this child wants *T*-1 . E_S ###I 'm working two jobs , E_S ###they each have their own television , E_S ###they each have their own telephone , E_S ###they each have their own rooms , E_S ###they each have this , E_S ###they each have that . E_S 
48096:13	###they each have that . E_S ###I 'd say , but what they do n't have *T*-1 is you . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###That 's right . E_S ###They need some attention . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Absolutely . E_S ###And , uh , I think out N_S ###because that is the way of * getting attention . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . 
48143:45	###SpeakerA111 . ###It is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###SpeakerA113 . ###It 's way too late , E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###I agree . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . 
48167:72	###Uh , we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football E_S ###and I did keep statistics for his team , E_S ###and , his Dad did take movies of the football team and movies of the basketball team , E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###Oh , great . E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###and we tried *-1 to be a part of it but * not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had *-2 to be there all the time . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . 
48172:5	###SpeakerB124 . ###and we tried *-1 to be a part of it but * not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had *-2 to be there all the time . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###So , \[ wh- , \+ \] I feel that I learned a great deal from my students , uh , with regard to what their biggest complaints *ICH*-2 were *T*-1 with parents . E_S ###And a thing such as , uh , N_S ###one of the biggest complaints 0 I well remember *T*-1 because I spent a lot of time with seniors , uh , was , um , * carrying their MUMBLEx E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###SpeakerB128 . 
48182:32	###when I was your age *T*-1 I did n't have this or that , E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###and \[ I know \+ 0 I never ever said that because I knew \] that that was one thing that *T*-1 was really irritating to young people . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###Well , I guess 0 that was good that \[ you were , \+ you were \] hearing it from other students . E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###Yes , E_S ###and I had *-1 to deal with their problems E_S 
48209:7	###but when he went away to coll- *T*-1 , N_S ###and he was on the lawns from the time 0 he was in the seventh grade and , uh , a small MUMBLEx and all the way through college E_S ###and he held three jobs .

48214:14	###Oh , goodness . E_S ###SpeakerB140 . ###He did n't even tell us .

E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
48252:70	###I mean it 's , N_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] should n't say 0 I do n't know if it was any worse , E_S ###but it certainly did n't get any better . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I usually just , N_S ###I 'm trying *-1 to think of , N_S 
48264:67	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature , uh , E_S you know , ###you should n't be able *-1 to go out there and just buy one \[ and , \+ \] you know , right off the shelf . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] agree with that . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###\[ And \+ but , \] N_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
48276:54	###Uh-huh , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###\[ I think that , \+ I think that \] the , N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And , so , I think 0 that kind of control \[ is , \+ would be \] good , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###but the , uh , N_S 
48280:79	###SpeakerA21 . ###And , so , I think 0 that kind of control \[ is , \+ would be \] good , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Um , I , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###And maybe they just do n't report those E_S ###or I 'm not sure E_S 
48296:72	###or , you know , I ca n't think of *-1 ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who *T*-2 was being robbed *-3 E_S ###but good thing 0 they had their gun on them E_S ###and \[ they , \+ they \] thwarted the robbery attempt .

48312:36	###SpeakerA31 . ###True . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###\[ \[ Did , \+ did you , \] \+ were you \] brought up in a family that *T*-1 hunted E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###No . E_S ###Uh , nobody in my family hunted , E_S

48339:27	###Oh , jeez . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###And so that was really the only experience *ICH*-2 that I 've had *T*-1 with guns E_S ###and \[ it , \+ it \] kind of scared me . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . 
48342:62	###and \[ it , \+ it \] kind of scared me . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###But I think that if I learn how *-1 to use one *T*-2 , \[ I would , \+ I would \] feel better . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right . E_S 
48346:21	###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###But I think that if I learn how *-1 to use one *T*-2 , \[ I would , \+ I would \] feel better . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right . E_S ###I 've also always thought about the idea 0 , you know , most sports , you know , which *T*-1 are ###the N R A and people have their thing , you know , N_S 0 if you ban guns , you 're just banning \[ the , \+ the \] recreation , the sport of hunting , things of that nature . E_S ###Most of that 's done *-1 with rifles and such . Uh , though there 's , you know , probably I 'm sure 0 *T*-3 some sector that *T*-2 does it with handguns . E_S ###But just by the mere fact of * outlawing handguns , would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous , E_S 
48358:43	###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA51 . 
48362:36	###* made it more difficult * to get \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ uh , a \] handgun .

48422:33	###SpeakerA1 . ###Um , so do you have a personal computer ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , well we do have one \[ in , \+ in \] our home , uh , E_S ###it 's on the fritz right now , because the monitor is n't working properly E_S ###but , uh , it has been , uh , used *-1 tremendously , mostly by my children for , uh , * playing games .

E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###However , um , you know , the bane of our existence these days , N_S ###uh , but it does have a word processing program , which all of us have used *T*-1 for \[ re- , \+ reports \] and papers and that sort of thing . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's what , N_S 
48466:38	###SpeakerB16 . ###Exactly , E_S ###and there are , lots of them on the market . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###yeah , E_S ###basically payroll . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
48467:4	###Exactly , E_S ###and there are , lots of them on the market . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###yeah , E_S ###basically payroll . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###But you do have *-1 to research that , find out what *T*-2 works for your system . E_S 
48502:74	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###so I do n't know if she 's going *-1 to even use it anymore . E_S ###\[ It , \+ it 's , \] N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Oh , well , well , * encourage her to try other things , E_S ###because , um , I am , uh , N_S ###I work in a school system , E_S ###and I teach writing E_S 
48568:20	###SpeakerB56 . ###Well , my son is , uh , studying electronic technology , E_S ###and he 's been able *-1 to do things *ICH*-3 \[ on \+ , uh , on \] the personal computer here that *T*-2 really have enhanced his , um , reports , and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah .

48601:13	###but \[ this is , \+ you know , this is \] one step above it , E_S ###but it 's actual , um , drafting , E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###and I always , N_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Yes , E_S ###you can do wonderful design . E_S ###\[ It , \+ it 's \] really , s- , \+ N_S

49464:84	###SpeakerB27 . ###I had , uh , a Mazda R X Seven before that E_S ###and that was the worse car 0 I 've ever driven *T*-1 in my life .

56229:7	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###And you put a little bit of that over it . E_S ###Now if you use the dried kind ? Then you would only use two of them . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yes .

56709:16	###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerA243 . ###And we went to this one , E_S ###it was called * The Back Porch . E_S ###And , uh , they were cooking the stuff , you know , while \[ we were , \+ we went \] on this boat ride . E_S ###And then we came back and ate , out on this , it was like a *RNR*-1 back porch . E_S ###And , uh , usually if you can find somebody , N_S ###SpeakerB244 . ###Oh , that 's nice . E_S ###SpeakerA245 . 
56723:24	###SpeakerA247 . ###I have never gone to a restaurant , and not just been so full , E_S ###it 's unreal . E_S ###SpeakerB248 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerA249 . ###I mean , it 's so good .

56767:40	###SpeakerA265 . ###And I 'll tell you what . E_S ###SpeakerB266 . ###See we do , um , uh , a thing , ###we call it a sea bake . E_S ###\[ You , \+ uh , you \] take clams , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , do you think , uh , N_S ###I mean I wonder , N_S ###the assumption is that it is a problem , uh , E_S 
56774:18	###Well , do you think , uh , N_S ###I mean I wonder , N_S ###the assumption is that it is a problem , uh , E_S ###and I 've never actually had too many people explain to me why it 's a problem *T*-1 , though I have the same instinctual feeling that it 's a problem E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , but \] it *EXP*-1 's not clear to me that it is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , bo- , N_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Um , it 's a problem if those voting do n't represent the population demographically , or in terms of their opinions . E_S ###But if those who *T*-1 do n't vote , if you made them vote N_S 
56774:124	###Well , do you think , uh , N_S ###I mean I wonder , N_S ###the assumption is that it is a problem , uh , E_S ###and I 've never actually had too many people explain to me why it 's a problem *T*-1 , though I have the same instinctual feeling that it 's a problem E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , but \] it *EXP*-1 's not clear to me that it is *?* .

56782:42	###Um , it 's a problem if those voting do n't represent the population demographically , or in terms of their opinions . E_S ###But if those who *T*-1 do n't vote , if you made them vote N_S ###and , it those who *T*-1 do n't vote would have voted exactly the same way , you know , in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other , just like everyone who *T*-4 did vote , it *EXP*-5 's not clear to me that it is really a problem , um . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Um , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] interesting , E_S ###because I had thought , N_S ###I \[ ha- , \+ feel \] that it 's a problem also , E_S ###but , I see your point on that . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] assume that those who *T*-1 do n't vote , N_S 
56806:57	###Um , \[ I guess , \+ I guess \] 0 I 'm a fan of democracy E_S ###and , uh , * wish 0 I could vote on more things frankly . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###That 's right , um , E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###But it 's funny because here in California things are getting , uh , increasingly democratically oriented , \[ in , \+ in \] the sense of people being able *-1 to vote for things . E_S ###I mean , we have these \[ initiatives , \+ state initiatives \] now . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . 
56815:18	###SpeakerA13 . ###The first really \[ popular , \+ you know wide spread \] one was , uh , Proposition Thirteen which *T*-1 was a , uh , tax revolt , against property taxes . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Right , E_S ###I r- , N_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh , and , you know , now we 're , N_S ###and that was whatever , ten years ago E_S ###and now we 're up to Proposition a Hundred and fifty or something like that .

56823:59	###and now we 're up to Proposition a Hundred and fifty or something like that . E_S ###I mean , we 've just , N_S ###there were apparently voters who *T*-1 just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were \[ asked , \+ being asked *-2 *-3 \] to make decisions on topics that *T*-4 would have three different competing proposals E_S ###and you had *-1 to vote for , you know , yes or no on each of them E_S ###and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them E_S ###and it was incredibly complicated and difficult . E_S ###And a lot of people revolted against that , E_S ###they said we do n't want *-1 to have *-2 to decide all these things , E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . 
56843:9	###I think 0 our elected officials say 0 they are speaking for us E_S ###but they 're not speaking for me . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I would n't mind *-1 having , oh , more votes than I get *-2 to have *?* , frankly . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
56865:16	###SpeakerB30 . ###Is that true ? E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###I did n't know that , E_S ###I was think- , N_S ###that is one solution to it . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
56869:7	###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###I did n't know that , E_S ###I was think- , N_S ###that is one solution to it . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###I do n't know how I feel *T*-1 about that . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###But I do n't , N_S ###that 's not really democratic . 
56891:35	###I mean here you have the right * to vote E_S ###and they simply define it as a duty there . E_S ###You know , \[ we have , \+ just as we have \] \[ a r- , \+ a duty \] * to pay taxes , you know , E_S ###is that democratic ? E_S ###I mean , we do n't have the right * to pay taxes in this country , E_S ###we have the duty * to pay taxes . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###It 's a duty , right . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###And in that country it *EXP*-1 's a duty * to pay taxes E_S 
56899:70	###SpeakerA41 . ###And in that country it *EXP*-1 's a duty * to pay taxes E_S ###and it *EXP*-3 's a duty * to vote on how those taxes are spent *-1 *T*-2 . E_S ###And it *EXP*-1 's not clear to me that , that 's so much less democratic . E_S ###Um . I do n't know , E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###but part of me rebels against that , E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
56909:52	###\[ \[ \[ I , \+ it 's , \] \+ that 's , \] \+ it 's \] complex question when you start *-2 thinking about it *T*-1 , is n't it *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###but then I 'm an American . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And some people do n't vote , E_S ###I mean there is N_S ###like three or four percent of Australians do n't vote E_S ###and I think 0 they 're \[ el- , \+ eligible \] for a fine . E_S 
56926:11	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###And \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 they feel 0 they can criticize if they do n't . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I was sort of , s- , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###I told them 0 if they do n't vote they do n't have the right * to criticize . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Well I , N_S 
56929:127	###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I was sort of , s- , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###I told them 0 if they do n't vote they do n't have the right * to criticize . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Well I , N_S ###that 's how I feel *T*-1 . E_S ###I mean , \[ if yo- , \+ if you \] vote and your guy looses well \[ you leas- , \+ you least \] tried E_S ###and you can say something E_S 
56937:22	###I mean , \[ if yo- , \+ if you \] vote and your guy looses well \[ you leas- , \+ you least \] tried E_S ###and you can say something E_S ###but if you do n't vote , \[ I sort of feel like , \+ part of me , and it 's kind of a nasty part of me feels like , \] well if you did n't vote , you get what *T*-1 's coming to you , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###That 's right , E_S ###I feel th- , N_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###And certainly that 's true in the overall , E_S ###I mean no one individual 0 that 's true for *T*-1 ###but for the population as a whole , E_S I sort of feel that way . 
56960:79	###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###It does n't really gain anything . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yes , E_S ###it \[ rea- , \+ really \] does n't , E_S ###and so \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a complicated situation , E_S ###but I would like *-1 to see , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###\[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] thinking of actually moving to Australia E_S

E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah , E_S 
57493:18	###so there goes the carburetor E_S ###and if the fuel injection system breaks down , there 's no way in the world 0 you 're going *-1 to work on that *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###No E_S ###there 's no way . E_S ###Somebody once said , uh , ###I had a car that *T*-1 said fuel injection on the side of it E_S 
57544:27	###And it was really fairly easy . E_S ###* Take the grill out and the radiator out E_S ###and you can just stand there and work on it . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah , E_S ###the hardest part about , uh , water pump changes is * getting all the junk off , before you can get too it . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Well that 's true .

57554:23	###I was hoping 0 I could remember where all those other things went *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###A few years ago I had an Oldsmobile diesel E_S ###and , uh , the , N_S ###uh , it , N_S ###after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump *ICH*-1 went out on it . E_S 
57555:5	###SpeakerA27 . ###Well that 's kind of the way 0 I was *T*-1 , E_S ###I tried *-1 to remember *ICH*-3 as I took stuff off where it went *T*-2 , E_S ###and I do n't think 0 I had too many nuts and bolts left * over when I got it all put *-1 back together *T*-2 .

57570:29	###SpeakerA29 . ###Oh , yeah . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And , uh , the injector pump went bad E_S ###so I found a outfit down here 0 *T*-1 to rebuild it .

57580:114	###I do n't think 0 I 'd know where * to start *T*-1 with a diesel .

57588:62	###And , uh , . N_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###I think 0 the \[ onl- , \+ closest \] thing 0 I 've come *T*-2 \[ to , \+ to \] a diesel is , 0 I 've worked for a tractor repair shop , uh , when I was in high school *T*-1 E_S ###and , uh , we used *-1 to overhaul farm tractors basically , E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###and they were nearly \[ all , \+ all \] diesel , E_S ###but as far as cars I 've never , never been involved with them . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . 
57612:54	###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###He was out at Tech E_S ###and \[ he , \+ he \] finished it off . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###\[ I 'm , \+ I \] guess 0 you 're right E_S ###\[ the , \+ the \] diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status . E_S ###I do n't know exactly why . E_S ###One of the reasons is N_S 
57631:30	###SpeakerB50 . ###You mean the diesel availability ? E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] notice E_S ###but maybe because I 'm not looking for it . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well I 'd bought , uh , a G M C diesel pickup and , uh , loved that thing , you know , E_S ###I really liked it . E_S 
57646:11	###* traded it in on the Chevy van . E_S ###But , uh , * sure enjoyed it . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###But \[ yo- , \+ you \] got \[ the , \+ the \] three fifty in the van ? E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S ###the three fifty regular gas engine . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah , E_S 
57651:31	###Yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S ###the three fifty regular gas engine . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's what I like *T*-1 because , they 've got plenty of power , E_S ###and , uh , if you treat them right , they 're not the gas guzzlers 0 I think that they 've got the reputation * to be *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
57651:63	###Yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S ###the three fifty regular gas engine .

E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
57669:43	###I 'm convinced that the small V eight like \[ the , \+ the \] Mustang 's original two eighty-nine or some of the Chevy two eighty-threes , were good little V eight engines that *T*-1 were not gas guzzlers E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###but they had enough power * t- , pull all this weight . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And the four cylinders just do n't have it . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . 
57674:39	###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And the four cylinders just do n't have it . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###I think 0 \[ that little , \+ the little \] Chevy V eight when it started out \[ in sixty , \+ in fifty-five , \] I think *T*-1 was two sixty-five , something like that . N_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Little , you know , not whole lot more \[ \[ than the , \+ than the , \] \+ than the \] six cylinder that I think 0 *T*-1 was like about two thirty-five or so . N_S 
57714:39	###and there was basically nothing in there but an engine , and a few things . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Now , you open the hood ###and it 's scary . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . 
57727:52	###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###And , uh , I was look under the hood of that the other day E_S ###and like you say , you can see the road . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###It 's amazing . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . 
57741:16	###My dad 's got a new , um , N_S ###I guess 0 it 's an eighty-nine or ninety , uh , Chrysler something or other . E_S ###It 's one of those transverse mounted V sixes , front wheel drive .

E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###And , uh , he was showing it to me E_S ###and we 're looking under the hood ###and everything 's nice and clean E_S ###and , you know , you can see the three spark plugs there in the front . E_S 
57757:9	###SpeakerA97 . ###And he says well , hopefully I wo n't have *-1 to change them , before I trade it off .

E_S ###There 's a lot of us that *T*-1 are opposed to war E_S 
58146:21	###SpeakerB100 . ###I mean they 're not helping anybody . E_S ###\[ That 's the , \+ that 's the \] whole point , E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###\[ Th- , \+ \] not .

58168:37	###Yeah .

58200:24	###So , well * have a good day E_S ###and I appreciate the conversation . E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###Thanks , E_S ###same here . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
58217:71	###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###because , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###To use you mean *T*-1 , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###yeah , E_S 
58230:55	###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh , it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it 's all decimal . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###And it *EXP*-1 's so easy * to convert from one set of units to another . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###We , N_S 
58239:26	###We , N_S ###well I 've lived both in the United States \[ and , \+ and \] in a country where they do use the metric system *T*-1 E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , so \] \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] lived with MUMBLEx pounds and inches and found it *EXP*-1 really quite easy * to convert over . E_S ###Um , the secret seeming to me * to be * to not bother ever *-2 converting inches to centimeters and , pounds to \[ kilom- , \+ uh , uh , kilograms , \] E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###SpeakerB16 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
58244:4	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###SpeakerB16 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###and , I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 hung people up the most is 0 they went now * wait a minute , ###an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
58256:115	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And the problem is that we tried *-1 to convert everything from inches to centimeters * preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than * saying no , a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail , or whatever , \[ and , \+ you know , and \] leaving it at that E_S ###and , uh , you know , a kilogram weighs about this much E_S ###and * get used to it from scratch , E_S ###cause I still ca n't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters E_S ###but I 'm perfectly comfortable *-1 using either . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . 
58277:16	###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh , I do n't know , E_S ###I mean even Britain has converted over E_S ###and we inherited this mess from them E_S ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###That 's right , E_S ###it 's all their fault . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Well , I mean , it 's more *ICH*-1 our fault than theirs at this point because \[ they , \+ they \] saw the light , um , E_S 
58323:21	###SpeakerB38 . ###No . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that would be the easiest way E_S ###but human nature being such as it is *?* , I would think 0 it would take , probably , two or three years before people \[ co- , \+ could \] completely cut the cord . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah , E_S 
58397:20	###and if you start *-1 expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in \[ the , \+ the , \] you know , the odd numbers , you know , two point two pounds or something . I think 0 people will start *-2 getting a sense of , gee the metric is the sensible one . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Right . E_S ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###That 's true . E_S ###Well , * sure have enjoyed our talk . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yes , E_S 
58419:5	###Okay , E_S ###so do you do a lot of cooking in your family ? E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Um , I do some every now and then , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] work E_S ###and my wife 's home during the day E_S ###so she usually ends up *-1 doing most of it . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . 
58457:9	###SpeakerA16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I 'm not , \+ I 'm \] a pretty bad cook . E_S ###I 'm pretty bad . E_S ###My husband is really good , E_S ###he put himself through college *-1 working in restaurants . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Oh , wow . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###And , uh , he 's much better cook than I am *?* , E_S 
58488:49	###SpeakerB23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###one is , uh , nine months E_S ###and the other is two and a half . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###Two and half , oh . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's the hard part is * cooking with , uh , kids around \[ because , \+ uh , becau- , \] N_S ###SpeakerA26 . 
58496:36	###that 's the hard part is * cooking with , uh , kids around \[ because , \+ uh , becau- , \] N_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###I was just going *-1 to say , 0 * makes a difference in what you eat *T*-2 does n't it . E_S ###Or are you not at that stage yet ? E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it does . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . 
58532:4	###Boy , I could n't do that , E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###But , um , yeah , E_S ###our favorite , N_S ###* let me think , E_S ###I was thinking of the one recipe \[ that , \+ uh , that \] we made *T*-1 . E_S ###I guess 0 the thing that *T*-1 always turned out the best for us was something 0 we thought 0 *T*-2 looked really fancy but was real easy , E_S ###and that was , um , uh , \[ scallops , \+ uh , scallop , \] um , N_S ###SpeakerA42 . 
58542:20	###What 's that *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###SpeakerA44 . ###Oh really . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###it has a French name , E_S ###it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese , cream sauce with it E_S ###and you pour it over rice , E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###Oh yeah , E_S 
58551:19	###Oh yeah , E_S ###\[ what 's , \+ what is \] that *T*-1 , ###Saint Jack or something . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###Yeah , uh . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###Scallops Saint something , E_S ###or , yeah , MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Yeah , E_S 
58592:26	###SpeakerB61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###and you came *-1 dressed *-2 as one of the characters E_S ###and you had *-1 to solve the mystery during the dinner , E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###and it was really fun E_S ###and so \[ \[ we , \+ we were thinking 0 we wanted *-1 to do , \] \+ you know , we were going *-2 to try *-2 doing \] it ourselves , E_S 
58645:18	###SpeakerB79 . ###My dad could eat , \[ a , \+ a \] meal with out any vegetables at all . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###Oh , my gosh . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###And , uh , Susan 's , you know , they had , you know meatless meals , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . 
58666:7	###SpeakerA88 . ###That you do , E_S ###right , E_S ###right , E_S ###that 's just part of it . E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA90 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ we did n't , \+ my family did n't , \] E_S 
58712:5	###\[ ye- , \+ \] it 's nice . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###Yeah , E_S ###some of the stuff is good , E_S ###but \[ it just , \+ it \] was a tremendous amount of cooking . E_S ###Because you do have *-1 to make * sure 0 you have the right combinations of different proteins to make * sure 0 they 're complete , E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###and we had little kids at the time , you know , E_S 
58758:18	###And , um , the sticky buns , of course , would last , you know three or four days E_S ###and that would be it . E_S ###SpeakerA116 . ###Yeah , E_S ###then be gone . E_S ###I know , E_S ###that 's the thing about baking . E_S ###\[ \[ I used *-1 to , \+ I , \] \+ I do n't mind \] *-2 baking at all E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I \] can do a pretty good pie , E_S ###we have this pie crust recipe *ICH*-1 in our family that my grandmother gave my mother *T*-2 E_S 
58776:16	###SpeakerB119 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA120 . ###I mean , \[ forge- , \+ \] it 's supposed *-1 to save you money E_S ###but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat *T*-1 . E_S ###It tastes so good . E_S ###SpeakerB121 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###\[ we always , \+ we had \] that bread that *T*-1 was , uh , um , N_S ###you ever seen \[ the , \+ the \] starter bread , E_S 
58804:32	###You know , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA128 . ###That sounds pretty good . E_S ###SpeakerB129 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it tasted pretty good , really . E_S ###SpeakerA130 . ###Yeah , E_S ###oh yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB131 . 
58815:13	###and then you add all these other ingredients to it , E_S ###but . N_S ###SpeakerA132 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and then \[ you sa- , \+ you make \] the bread E_S ###but you pinch off a portion , or save a portion of it for the next time , or something . E_S ###SpeakerB133 . ###Yeah E_S ###right , E_S ###\[ ye- , \+ you \] take some of the batter out and give it to someone else E_S 
58821:16	###SpeakerB133 . ###Yeah E_S ###right , E_S ###\[ ye- , \+ you \] take some of the batter out and give it to someone else E_S ###and that 's how they continue the thing *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA134 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###I know , 0 \[ it sounds , \+ it always sounded , \] N_S 
58840:4	###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] got *-2 to kill anything I guess 0 *T*-1 , E_S ###but . N_S ###SpeakerB137 . ###Okay , E_S ###well , I 'll talk to you later . E_S ###SpeakerA138 . ###All right , E_S ###well , yeah E_S ###thanks . E_S ###SpeakerB139 .

61717:24	###SpeakerB14 . ###Yes .

61796:21	###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###And then the keyboard is another fifty , E_S ###the monitor with the card that * drives *T*-1 is another hundred E_S ###and then the disk drive is two fifty . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
61820:118	###and it 's probably an inch thick a thousand pages .

E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Oh , no . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Okay , E_S ###so after that then \[ you could n't get a \+ , you could n't get a \] tape 0 * to play *T*-1 at the right speed in that side . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . 
62570:4	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###And then on the other side , \[ when I , \+ when \[ I , uh , \+ I \[ loa- , \+ loaned \] \] \] it to my daughter the other day * to take it over \[ to , \+ uh , to , \] uh , videotaping 0 they were doing *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S ###and she says 0 it 's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far , E_S ###and so \[ you ca n't , \+ you ca n't \] get it to run \[ the right , \+ the right \] way , either , E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###so , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB104 . 
62575:19	###SpeakerB102 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###so , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###What brand is it *T*-1 ? E_S ###Do you know ? E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so \[ I , \+ I \] wish 0 I could tell you E_S 
62579:13	###SpeakerB104 . ###What brand is it *T*-1 ? E_S ###Do you know ? E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so \[ I , \+ I \] wish 0 I could tell you E_S ###I really do n't know which brand it is *T*-1 . E_S ###It 's , N_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###But I was wondering like , you know E_S 
62658:40	###I think 0 that 's right . E_S ###The fact that , N_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###because I , N_S ###they want people to replace it after , a couple of years . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###SpeakerA137 . ###The fact \[ that they , \+ that they \] have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes , uh , dwells on a fact that , you know , uh , N_S 
62685:26	###SpeakerA145 . ###so , part of it is that we need *-1 to develop more \[ of a , \+ of a \] pride \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , the kinds of things 0 we do *T*-2 so we make them better . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###Good . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA147 . ###And it kind of has *-1 to start from the top \[ \[ and , \+ and go clea- , \] \+ or from the bottom maybe and go clear \] up . E_S ###People , N_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###Well , I think 0 part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship . E_S 
62698:64	###SpeakerB150 . ###SpeakerA151 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB152 . ###You know , the whole , N_S ###nobody cares , \[ no , \+ nobody 's , \] really paying , N_S ###SpeakerA153 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###SpeakerA155 . 
62703:4	###nobody cares , \[ no , \+ nobody 's , \] really paying , N_S ###SpeakerA153 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###SpeakerA155 . ###Attitude \[ is , \+ is \] * just get me my dollar so I can go *-3 do what I want *-1 to do *T*-2 , and , MUMBLEx on , E_S ###SpeakerB156 . ###Right , E_S ###* give me my paycheck , so I can go home . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . 
62705:32	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###SpeakerA155 . ###Attitude \[ is , \+ is \] * just get me my dollar so I can go *-3 do what I want *-1 to do *T*-2 , and , MUMBLEx on , E_S ###SpeakerB156 . ###Right , E_S ###* give me my paycheck , so I can go home . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . ###what I 'm doing *T*-1 , right . E_S ###I think 0 that 's too bad . E_S 
62711:7	###* give me my paycheck , so I can go home . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . ###what I 'm doing *T*-1 , right . E_S ###I think 0 that 's too bad . E_S ###And it 's a shame too because , uh , when you get right down to it *T*-1 most things , \[ there is n't any , \+ \] if you do a good job , nobody can pay you enough . E_S ###There is n't , any way 0 * to get paid *-1 enough *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB158 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA159 . ###But if you do a good job , you feel enough satisfaction , E_S 
62716:43	###There is n't , any way 0 * to get paid *-1 enough *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB158 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA159 . ###But if you do a good job , you feel enough satisfaction , E_S ###so whatever you 're paid *T*-1 is enough . E_S ###SpeakerB160 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and also I think , N_S ###well , I do research E_S 
62726:37	###and so I 'm used to * sort of being underpaid *-2 for whatever work *T*-1 gets done *-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA161 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB162 . ###\[ But , \+ and \] you get satisfaction out of it . E_S ###SpeakerA163 . ###That 's right , E_S ###SpeakerB164 . ###\[ And , \+ But \] \[ I think 0 a lot of it , \+ you know , I think 0 things \] come both from the , uh , individual side and also from the company side E_S ###SpeakerA165 . 
62742:5	###SpeakerA167 . ###SpeakerB168 . ###and we just want you to do your day 's work , E_S ###SpeakerA169 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB170 . ###and we do n't really care about you , as an individual . E_S ###SpeakerA171 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB172 . 
62752:16	###When you 've got that type of attitude on it *T*-1 , the people do n't care , about their work . E_S ###SpeakerA173 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB174 . ###And so , N_S ###SpeakerA175 . ###\[ It probab- , \+ it probably \] basically goes right back into the \[ h- , \+ home \] though unfortunately . E_S ###* Starts with the one person that , you know , N_S ###and so you need *-1 to really work hard at * helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB176 . 
62780:38	###I try *-1 to walk . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And , uh , last year \[ I would , \+ I did \] it every day , E_S ###but \[ I 've kind of , \+ in ninety-one I 've kind of \] gone down hill . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###And so I 'm not doing it as much as I need *-1 to *?* , E_S 
62790:7	###but \[ I , \+ I \] can tell you 0 when I \[ do \+ do \] it on a regular basis *T*-1 I feel so much better and so much healthier . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###I agree . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###But it 's just * to get motivated *-1 to do it , E_S ###and once I get started *-1 , \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ \] \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] ca- , \+ I do \] it every night . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###It 's just * to get , uh , \[ motiv- , \+ motivated \] again , E_S 
62814:11	###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###but . N_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###I have n't walked since , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###It *EXP*-1 's always easy * to find an excuse 0 * not to exercise *T*-2 . E_S 
62922:16	###And I think 0 another thing is that my friend that *T*-1 was taking with me the first two months was n't *?* the second two months . E_S ###She started *-1 taking tennis lessons , E_S ###and so I have n't had that extra motivation , \[ of , \+ of \] us \[ forcing each other , \+ or \[ not forcing each other but \+ \] encouraging each other \+ \] to go . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Sure , E_S ###yeah E_S 
62931:16	###yeah E_S ###that makes a difference when you have somebody 0 * to go with *T*-1 and 0 *T*-2 to do the same the same thing *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Like it 's misery loves company . E_S ###I do n't really love exercise . E_S ###I mean , some I , N_S ###the neighbor across the street , she \[ goes , \+ belongs \] to President 's , E_S ###and , uh , it 's not President 's any more . E_S 
62947:16	###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###She just enjoys it so much . E_S ###And I do n't . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I 'm the same way . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###I feel good after I do it , E_S 
62954:12	###I 'm the same way . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###I feel good after I do it , E_S ###but I hate it when I 'm doing it *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###You know , I just , N_S ###I do n't enjoy it at all , E_S ###and she just loves it . E_S 
62976:8	###SpeakerB68 . ###and I have an older sister that *T*-1 loves running , too , E_S ###and she runs all the time , E_S ###but \[ at , \+ to \] me , it 's every minute 's agony , E_S ###and I , N_S ###in fact , I do n't run .

62997:19	###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###And it 's not as boring if you get several people E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###and you can kind of talk , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] \[ it , \+ it \] makes it pass pretty quickly , E_S ###and the aerobics is n't too boring . E_S 
63012:16	###SpeakerA77 . ###But , uh , \[ I do , \+ I do \] have *-1 to make myself go , E_S ###and of course while I 'm doing it I feel pretty good , E_S ###and after I get finished I feel great . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Oh , it 's great afterwards , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###I mean , I can go in there , E_S ###I can be , N_S 
63019:19	###SpeakerA79 . ###I mean , I can go in there , E_S ###I can be , N_S ###like a Friday afternoon when I 'm tired , it 's the end of the week and I just want *-1 to go home *T*-2 . ###\[ And \+ \] I 'll make myself go , E_S ###and I 'll have headache and everything , E_S ###and I get out , E_S ###I do n't have a headache any more .

63057:33	###well , I just got over the flu , E_S ###and I 'm still kind of draggy E_S ###so I better *-1 not go . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###It 's kind of a vicious circle is n't it *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah , E_S 
63061:16	###It 's kind of a vicious circle is n't it *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I find , too , that I have more energy when I exercise *T*-1 , E_S ###and , you know , it *EXP*-1 's silly * not to *?* , E_S ###but , I do n't know , E_S ###it 's just a put off . E_S 
63119:42	###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###Since it 's more expensive , I think , Okay , you spent that much money , ###you 'd better *-1 go . E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###That 's right , E_S ###that 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###So hopefully . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . 
63131:26	###SpeakerA117 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###it 's right there , E_S ###and \[ it 's , \+ they \] have a really nice facility at the T I . E_S ###They 've got two different aerobics rooms , E_S ###they have the mirrors . E_S ###Of course , sometimes you do n't like *-1 to see the mirrors on the wall E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###SpeakerA119 . 
63176:47	###SpeakerB130 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###But there 's a lot more guys that *T*-1 do that one . E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###And , um , they have them , you know , in the evenings , E_S ###they even have some late night ones for people that *T*-1 work second shift and things like that . E_S ###So they have big variety . E_S 
63224:48	###No , E_S ###not at all . E_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###Pretty cheap . E_S ###SpeakerB150 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA151 . ###And then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership , E_S 
63241:4	###SpeakerB154 . ###People of all ages take advantage of the aerobics ? E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###in fact , uh , the T I-er 's families can come in on these things , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###the topic was , should the United States adopt the metric system , ###and if so , should , uh .

63259:18	###well , \[ I , \+ I \] am *?* too . E_S ###I wish , uh , 0 it had started a long time ago , is the problem , because we 're so wound up \[ in the \+ in the \] system that we 've got *T*-1 that , you know , * trying *-2 to convert over , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###and I guess , \[ what 'd they try *T*-1 , \+ 0 they tried \] what 'd the call it *T*-2 , soft conversion and hard conversion N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah , E_S ###they tried the , N_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
63259:32	###well , \[ I , \+ I \] am *?* too .

63284:50	###They do , E_S ###but things are generally packaged *-1 in the English sized packages , you know . E_S ###You buy a quart of milk , E_S ###and sure it \[ has , \+ has \] the metric equivalent written * on there , E_S ###but it still a quart . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###But if they started *-1 putting it in liters , \[ liter \+ \] of oil , and you know , liters of gasoline , people are going *-2 to learn *-3 to think in metric . E_S 
63286:24	###You buy a quart of milk , E_S ###and sure it \[ has , \+ has \] the metric equivalent written * on there , E_S ###but it still a quart . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah .

63298:18	###SpeakerB18 . ###It figures . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###we were living in Lubbock at the time , E_S ###they started *-1 marketing it in liters , E_S ###and it was only like twenty-nine and thirty cents a liter . E_S ###So they could put this sign *ICH*-2 out front that *T*-1 said , you know , thirty-nine cents a liter . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
63303:5	###and it was only like twenty-nine and thirty cents a liter . E_S ###So they could put this sign *ICH*-2 out front that *T*-1 said , you know , thirty-nine cents a liter . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And nobody had any idea what a liter was *T*-1 , E_S ###so , uh . N_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###\[ That , \+ that 's \] the problem . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . 
63304:19	###So they could put this sign *ICH*-2 out front that *T*-1 said , you know , thirty-nine cents a liter . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right .

E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###When we finally out that liters was about a quart *T*-1 , there 's about four liters in a gallon E_S 
63309:5	###so , uh . N_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###\[ That , \+ that 's \] the problem . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###When we finally out that liters was about a quart *T*-1 , there 's about four liters in a gallon E_S ###so you can figure out what you 're actually paying *T*-1 for it . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###It *EXP*-1 's kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S 
63319:100	###when I was growing up *T*-1 , we were talking metric system in school . ###I mean , \[ not , \+ not \] at first , E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh .

63322:41	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###but by the time 0 I was in fifth or sixth grade *T*-1 anyway . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###I would expect people with any kind of buying power \[ over the age , \+ you know , under the age \] of thirty or so , to have some idea what it is *T*-1 , anyway . E_S ###A liter 's about a quart . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
63325:5	###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###I would expect people with any kind of buying power \[ over the age , \+ you know , under the age \] of thirty or so , to have some idea what it is *T*-1 , anyway . E_S ###A liter 's about a quart . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###\[ The , \+ uh , I think 0 maybe there 's where the \] problem came in *T*-1 , you know . E_S ###We 've tried *-1 to , instead of *-2 learning , E_S ###it 's kind of like * learning a language , you know , E_S 
63344:16	###SpeakerA33 . ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Well , thing is , 0 it 's a \[ global , \+ global \] market place these days , E_S ###and , you know , we 're like , what , one of two backwards countries in the world , as far as , N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I read that , what Uganda and , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Something . E_S 
63378:29	###SpeakerB46 . ###Right . E_S ###Mils and microns . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###SpeakerB48 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###SpeakerB50 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . 
63385:46	###SpeakerB50 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###And then you end up with a decimal , where you start *-1 getting into mils , and that sort of thing *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###And then some of them are done *-1 in , you know , purely metric . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah , E_S 
63401:25	###somewhere down the line they went standardized , E_S ###they went microns , E_S ###but , uh , \[ you just , \+ you know , you \] end up with all kinds of problems with *-1 converting your designs . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Oh , I can imagine . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###\[ The , \+ uh , the \] one that , uh , uh , N_S 
63407:60	###SpeakerB58 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###\[ The , \+ uh , the \] one that , uh , uh , N_S ###have you ever lived in a country where they use metric *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###I was with T I in El Salvador for a while , E_S ###and I had *-1 to get used to , you know , purely metric system down there , because they did n't understand anything else . E_S 
63428:29	###You know , I guess 0 that 's some N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###About half a liter . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###it 's not a liter , E_S ###it 's like a half a liter or something like that . E_S ###It 's a strange looking can . E_S ###But my daughter in law 's from Panama , E_S ###and \[ she has , \+ they have had \] Americans down there for so long , you know , that they 're kind of into both systems , E_S ###but , uh , she gets real confused on distances E_S 
63445:173	###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###Well , I had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature , you know , E_S ###if it 's between zero and ten , it 's cold , E_S ###and if it 's ten and twenty it 's not too bad , E_S ###if it 's between twenty and thirty it 's pretty warm , E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###It 's getting warm , right . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###if it 's more than thirty it 's just hotter than all get out . E_S 
63454:24	###if it 's more than thirty it 's just hotter than all get out . E_S ###\[ So , \+ but , \] uh . The big problem is not * having \[ the , \+ uh , the \] resolution \[ between temperature , \+ you know , between a hundred , \] if you 're talking about a hundred degrees or what , thirty , zero , you know thirty four degrees , whatever that is *T*-1 . E_S ###You know , you do n't get all the little differences E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's about . N_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###you know , the differences between seventy and seventy-two or seventy-five degrees is n't much , E_S ###but the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is , quite a bit . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . 
63473:18	###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so . \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 as long as people have a choice , they 're going *-1 to stick with the American way . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###And until we \[ have * to , \+ have *-1 to \] learn *-2 to think that way , we wo n't *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Though we call it the English system , E_S 
63532:43	###It just gets bad , E_S ###now , \[ you got *-1 to , \+ you got *-2 to \] have one , and not mix them up . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Because you 're never going *-1 to get to \[ one , \+ one \] system if you still \[ got a , \+ got a \] mix . E_S ###And of course , here \[ that , \+ that \] would involve * changing road signs all across the country , you know , ###miles per hour to kilometers per hour , and the whole nine yards . E_S ###Kind of hard 0 * to do *T*-1 gradually . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . 
63572:29	###they could 've converted it to metric just about as easy . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 they , N_S ###you got the problem with all your cars are still , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###you still got cars on the road that *T*-2 do n't have both . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB112 .

63702:73	###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###and it *EXP*-1 's , uh , I guess a lot more \[ e- , \+ ecological \] * to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil .

63769:100	###\[ I s- , \+ I seen \] a lot of adds *ICH*-1 recently for organic fertilizers \[ and , \+ and \] lawn additives and that type of thing , E_S ###but the cost \[ is , \+ is \] like , double or sometimes triple , \[ what \+ \] the regular \[ things 0 you , \+ fertilizers and things 0 you \] buy *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Now , see that 's recycling , you know , E_S 
63778:14	###Now , see that 's recycling , you know , E_S ###companies that *T*-1 do at least go into it , E_S I 'd like *-1 to see subsidy by the government or something , or tax-wise or something , heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular *T*-2 .

65795:56	###Well , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###but , uh , you know , I think , 0 uh , \[ they , \+ maybe they \] need *-2 to , uh , help *-3 promote that more .

E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###I do n't know , you know , what kind of options they 've got *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Well , that 's something about what Germany 's supposed *-1 to be doing *T*-2 . Something similar to that right now . E_S 
65796:106	###SpeakerA45 . ###but , uh , you know , I think , 0 uh , \[ they , \+ maybe they \] need *-2 to , uh , help *-3 promote that more .

E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Well , that 's something about what Germany 's supposed *-1 to be doing *T*-2 . Something similar to that right now . E_S ###And , uh , they have jobs out on , you know , bulletin boards so people know what *T*-1 is open for an apprentices in different fields . E_S 
65842:4	###Well , it seems to me that kids that *T*-1 \[ a- , \+ \] get out of high school that parents *T*-4 have gone to college and college here and college there that *T*-2 are really not interested in *-3 going to college and forced *-3 into it , usually are your drop outs . ###Where if they 're said *-5 , hey , it *EXP*-7 's just as advisable * to go into something 0 you enjoy *T*-6 and you like *T*-6 . N_S ###Because you can get just as far as *-1 being a journeyman , carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that . Make as much money E_S ###and if they enjoy it more , they 'll make a lo- , happier life for themselves . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Question . N_S ###You threw that question *ICH*-1 on me about the deficit , E_S ###* put it on your shoe now . E_S 
65863:74	###\[ And , \+ and \] obviously \[ the , \+ the \] demand for their goods is quite high here , E_S ###so they can get their goods in here . E_S ###And , uh , you know , * to start *-1 even that out we need *-2 to continue *-3 to , you know , at least threaten that , you know , E_S we 're going *-4 to give them higher tariffs , etcetera *-5 to raise their prices to , you know , ours . E_S ###But , uh , it 's just that , uh , they 're , eh , N_S ###I think 0 \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] going *-1 to find that just because the United States , you know , there is such a demand here , the market , you know . N_S ###And , uh , uh , the \[ mone- , \+ you know , money \] being spent *-1 and the goods flow in and \[ we do n't sell , \+ you know , we do n't , uh , sell \] products abroad as much as we bring in . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Were you watching , N_S ###I think , uh , N_S 
65867:11	###I think 0 \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] going *-1 to find that just because the United States , you know , there is such a demand here , the market , you know .

E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Were you watching , N_S ###I think , uh , N_S ###one of the news stations . I could n't even tell you which one I watched *T*-1 . But they had on there , where \[ the , \+ the \] output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones 0 *T*-2 are exporting *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB1 . 
65887:36	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###So , \[ I p- , \+ I pack \] around a lot of them , E_S ###but I only use a few of them . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###You have a lot of discipline . E_S ###They make it *EXP*-2 really easy for people *ICH*-1 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get credit cards , especially college students . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . 
65901:32	###And they give you such high credit limits . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] easy * to get caught *-2 up in the minimum payment trap . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Uh , right . E_S ###And then \[ they , \+ they \] give you , uh , uh , the credit limit , E_S ###and then you 're always \[ s- , \+ seemingly \] up to that limit . E_S ###Now I have quite a few credit cards that I 'm always almost up to the limit on most of *T*-1 them . E_S 
65987:47	###SpeakerB47 . ###So I thought , man , I do n't know if I trust this or not . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###Well , \[ they , \+ they \] do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time . E_S ###\[ \[ Ev- , \+ ev- , \] \+ everybody \] in the world will offer you \[ a , \+ a \] credit card . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###It 's like , * let 's see if we can get her to run up her bills . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###SpeakerB51 . ###But it 's hard , E_S 
66001:30	###SpeakerA52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###SpeakerA54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Just \[ I fe- , \+ I feel \] like even that little bit helps . E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , you know , the way 0 the economy 's going *T*-1 and inflation and the recession and all that , I think 0 \[ we , \+ we \] really need *-2 to try *-3 to stay out of debt as much as possible . E_S 
66002:17	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###SpeakerA54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Just \[ I fe- , \+ I feel \] like even that little bit helps . E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , you know , the way 0 the economy 's going *T*-1 and inflation and the recession and all that , I think 0 \[ we , \+ we \] really need *-2 to try *-3 to stay out of debt as much as possible . E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] why \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] really started *-1 to try *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] pay off mine and get out of debt *T*-3 . 
66016:4	###Especially me . E_S ###I work for Texas Instruments , E_S ###and they 've \[ had , \+ had \] a lot \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , you know , layoffs lately . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###Well , I work for T I too . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###You do ? E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###And I think 0 they 're getting ready *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] probably sell us *ICH*-1 out , our division . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . 
66035:72	###SpeakerA66 . ###SpeakerB67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ They just , \+ they just \] announced that , did n't they *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###So , I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] kind of a bad time 0 * to be a slave to your credit cards *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###\[ It , \+ it \] certainly is *?* . E_S 
66047:52	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . ###People , uh , that N_S ###they just had this jewelry account . E_S ###It was Zales jewelry , in fact .

66107:83	###SpeakerA94 . ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB95 . ###that 's scary . E_S ###SpeakerA96 . ###SpeakerB97 . ###SpeakerA98 . ###A- , a- , N_S ###and , anyway , we need *-1 to watch our credit reports and all that kind of , N_S ###SpeakerB99 . 
66128:11	###You might even find 0 somebody 's been reporting on you E_S ###and you did n't even know it . E_S ###You know , \[ you , \+ I mean you \] might think 0 you 're paying something on time E_S ###\[ or \+ and \] you , by that day N_S ###and you 're \[ thir- , \+ ###thirty \] days is not real bad though anyway . ###If you 've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB103 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . 
66157:44	###I felt like with Visa and Mastercard and American Express you did n't need another one . E_S ###SpeakerA114 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB115 . ###I would think 0 it would n't be , you know , much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent 0 everyone else charges *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA116 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB117 . ###So \[ that , \+ that \] would n't be too bad . E_S ###SpeakerA118 . 
66165:14	###So \[ that , \+ that \] would n't be too bad . E_S ###SpeakerA118 . ###Well , * always watch out for \[ s- , \+ \] anybody who *T*-1 bills you out of Atlanta , Georgia . E_S ###Or there 's a couple of other places that *T*-1 are able *-2 to charge us like twenty-one and twenty-two percent interest . E_S ###I know , ###I had a charge with , uh , Spiegel , E_S ###and I had n't read the , uh , terms of the credit agreement really . E_S ###SpeakerB119 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA120 . 
66234:15	###And it *EXP*-2 took me about eighteen months *-1 to get \[ that , \+ all of that \] mess off of my account . E_S ###SpeakerA150 . ###Wow ! E_S ###SpeakerB151 . ###So \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] probably the worst thing 0 I 've ever had *T*-1 happen with a credit card . E_S ###SpeakerA152 . ###I wonder if they ... N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###I 'll let you go first . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . 
66244:11	###Oh , well , what *ICH*-2 's there *T*-3 0 * to say *T*-1 ? E_S ###* Does n't seem like it 's being carried *-1 out very well in my opinion . E_S ###* Seems like it takes so long *ICH*-2 between conviction and * carrying out the penalty that I do n't see that it *EXP*-1 makes any difference * to sentence anybody . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it seems like they could die of old age *-1 waiting *-2 to get the death penalty . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S 
66257:11	###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###and , uh , I 've seen , uh , a lot of people get \[ convicted , \+ sentenced *-1 , \] E_S ###and then just nothing *ICH*-1 happens , just endless , endless , endless appeals . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh , E_S 
66268:5	###I saw a statistic *ICH*-2 just a few days ago , um , 0 so far this \[ ye- , \+ year , \] or was it during the last year , \[ somewh- , \+ during \] a year 's time , I think 0 it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation . E_S ###Meanwhile , there were twenty-five hundred people on death row . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###So \[ I , \+ I , \] N_S ###and it 's building up , you know , E_S ###\[ they 're , \+ they 're \] convicting them faster than they 're executing them E_S ###so it 's really building up . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S 
66280:30	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###And , uh , here in Maryland I know 0 *T*-1 we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons , ###uh , E_S just , N_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###everybody 's got that . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but I mean , in , N_S 
66296:29	###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And it was just , uh , amazing to me , E_S ###and of course they made a big deal out of \[ the , \+ the \] few that *T*-1 got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of *-2 getting out , and being rearrested *-2 an . N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . 
66367:72	###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###I mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that , I mean pretty soon you run out of people 0 * to murder *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah , E_S ###the only consolation is 0 so many of the murders are , you know , N_S the , the violent people going against each other E_S ###and so they , you know , N_S ###society 's not going *-1 to put them to death , E_S ###well at least maybe the guy 0 they cross *T*-1 next time is going *-2 to *?* . 
66375:21	###society 's not going *-1 to put them to death , E_S ###well at least maybe the guy 0 they cross *T*-1 next time is going *-2 to *?* . ###Uh , N_S \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say , you know , this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society *T*-1 E_S ###and we are there by going *-1 to remove them from society , not temporarily , but permanently . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] personally think 0 life imprisonment , E_S ###I do n't think much \[ of li- , \+ of life \] imprisonment . ###First of all , it 's never , turns out *-1 to be life , E_S 
66379:12	###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] personally think 0 life imprisonment , E_S ###I do n't think much \[ of li- , \+ of life \] imprisonment . ###First of all , it 's never , turns out *-1 to be life , E_S ###but second , you know , why should we *?* *T*-1 , N_S ###the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole . E_S ###Well that means 0 you 're going *-1 to put them in a cage ###you think 0 it *EXP*-3 's never ever going *-2 to be safe for them to walk the streets again , E_S 
66389:19	###well then , why * bother *T*-1 . E_S ###* Just execute them , because \[ that 's , \+ that \] way you 're sure 0 they 'll never ever going *-1 to walk the streets again . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###So \[ \[ any , \+ any , \] \+ anybody \] that *T*-1 says life in prison with no chance of parole , I 'd say , uh , * give them the death penalty . E_S ###So , . N_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah , E_S ###you know , it makes sense , um , you know , E_S 
66395:132	###So , . N_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah , E_S ###you know , it makes sense , um , you know , E_S ###you have the occasional person who *T*-1 may have been falsely accused *-2 , ###but I mean , uh , so few and far between , uh , you know , E_S ###* makes good T V movies E_S ###and that 's about it .

66451:7	###And , uh , it turned out that the , you know , policeman survived to the point that he was able *-1 to , you know , identify the guy *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh .

66523:29	###SpeakerA95 . ###SpeakerB96 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###SpeakerB98 . ###Well the thing 0 I 'd be most likely *-1 to attach the death penalty to *T*-2 is the violence .

E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###And the people 0 I 'd most likely want *-1 to sentence *T*-2 to death are the people that *T*-3 just show a really low regard for human life . E_S ###That , you know , N_S 
66543:25	###I agree . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###And so I go , le- , N_S ###these are the kind of people 0 I would like *-1 to \[ ye- , \+ \] get *T*-2 out of here and get *T*-2 out of circulation and say \[ I do n't , \+ we do n't \] accept your kind in our society . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I agree , E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I 've , \] \+ I have , \] uh , a low tolerance for \[ that kind of , \+ uh , that kind of \] person .

66605:18	###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###And that 's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###but it 's a lot .

66670:9	###SpeakerB40 . ###And she lasted about two weeks , E_S ###and her ankles could n't take it anymore . E_S ###She was used to *-1 running , you know flat tracks and whatnot , E_S ###and uh , ever since that , it 's just been real difficult . E_S ###It 's real aggravating , because she starts in E_S ###and her ankles will start *-1 hurting again and stuff . Even if she does get on flat ground , E_S ###so she 's kind of in the same mode .

E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###It was a big \[ hunk , \+ hunk \] of the day . E_S ###Uh , and then of course another hour 0 * to get back home *T*-1 . E_S 
67044:5	###Yeah . E_S ###Do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there ? E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Not so much . E_S ###Uh , I guess 0 mostly I bike on my own .

67200:27	###And , uh , yeah , E_S ###I guess 0 I just never really thought about it much for a while , uh , until I suddenly discovered 0 all my friends were basically biking a lot .

67240:4	###You say 0 you ride about a hundred , hundred fifty miles a week ? E_S ###SpeakerB99 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###Man . E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] hard-core . E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###On average , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA102 .

67390:25	###SpeakerA20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###and I just , N_S ###you get so attached to them . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###I had a , uh , N_S ###last year \[ I had ano- , \+ I had another \] German Shepherd , E_S ###now this one was purebred E_S

67691:14	###And that was the thing 0 I could n't figure *T*-1 out E_S because he would go in the lake , E_S ###it was n't like he did n't N_S ###SpeakerB129 . ###Uh-huh .

67707:37	###and she did n't want you getting her wet . E_S ###SpeakerA134 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S ###obstinate , E_S ###obstinate . E_S ###SpeakerB135 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but you really need *-1 to see that movie . E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I \] \+ \[ w- , \+ we \] \] bought the movie E_S

67796:23	###yeah . E_S ###They just , uh , started it again , too just late , or , within the past few years . E_S ###You know for quite some time , just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###But now it 's coming back into favor . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , yes . E_S ###Well , they find 0 it is more deterrent . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , my sociology class at S M U 's taught us that it was not a deterrent . E_S

67821:18	###That was before \[ the , \+ uh , uh , they adopted the \] death law again .

N_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Well I , N_S ###uh , when is your next one , uh , scheduled now *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Well it 's like , the last one was my high school graduation E_S 
69596:26	###SpeakerA79 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###and does he *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###No , E_S ###he 's trying *-1 to get in med school , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###well , we do n't either , E_S 
69656:13	###SpeakerA1 . ###All right . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , I can go ahead and start and tell you mine E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###We 're from San Antonio E_S 
69697:4	###And if you go just a little bit ways in , I 'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas , uh , the weather completely changes E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###and it gets very hot and dry E_S ###and the fog never makes it that far . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###But along here it 's , uh , \[ very \+ , very \] different from the Texas type weather . E_S 
69761:4	###SpeakerA41 . ###and , uh , there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Oh , I miss that . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###MUMBLEx drove through San Antonio E_S ###and I spoke to somebody else *ICH*-1 this morning from San Antonio E_S ###and were , N_S ###they had , N_S ###and we came back . E_S 
69801:7	###Oh . Yeah . E_S ###I really do n't miss all the heat there . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###I 'm getting acclimated *-1 to have the cool evenings E_S ###so we get a bit of a relief . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I 'm from here originally , E_S 
69812:15	###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###The biggest problem \[ with , \+ with \] the weather and the rain in this area is the soil . E_S ###It 's that black clay soil . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . 
69829:20	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###You know , once it rains a little bit , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] filled *-1 up ###and everything else just runs off , E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###you know . N_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S 
69850:28	###And there 's a section in South Dallas that *T*-1 's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , we could use some rain up here . E_S ###We 're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought , up here E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###and they had a pretty good early Spring E_S ###and we got quite a bit of rain , E_S 
69861:77	###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###\[ And , \+ uh , so \] they 're still talking water rationing this Summer , E_S ###so it would seem strange because in San Antonio , N_S ###we had lived out , um , west of San Antonio , in Castroville , E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###And the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down , that they were considering that they might have *-1 to do water rationing E_S 
69918:5	###SpeakerA99 . ###I guess 0 I 'd prefer that . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Yeah . E_S ###To the heat . E_S ###I really do n't miss the heat . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Um , we do a lot of , you know , N_S 
69930:14	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###and you do n't have *-1 to worry about the high humidity . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###Does Dallas get high humidity ? E_S ###Or is it pretty dry . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###It 's pretty dry . E_S 
69965:19	###you can lay on the beach all 0 you want *?* *T*-1 , E_S ###but if you want *-1 to go *-3 wind suffering or diving or swimming , you have *-2 to wear a wet suit . And a thick wet suit at that , because it 's just extremely cold E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###and I , N_S ###for some reason , because of the cold , uh , ocean , uh , water , the air is always cool . E_S ###It 's never humid or sticky or salty feeling , E_S ###so I really like that about this area . E_S ###And , uh , we just had n't expected it , E_S 
69965:49	###you can lay on the beach all 0 you want *?* *T*-1 , E_S ###but if you want *-1 to go *-3 wind suffering or diving or swimming , you have *-2 to wear a wet suit .

69982:43	###Yeah . E_S ###Probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference , E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###It does E_S ###and the air does n't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region . E_S ###But you , um , N_S ###but we like it E_S ###so it 's a nice change . E_S ###So we 'll be here a couple of years E_S 
70008:14	###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###And , they have , of course , some pretty severe storms , Winter storms , snow and that type of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###But they 're so good about * clearing the roads , that , you know , it does n't usually bother you very much . E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S 
70020:60	###Yeah . E_S ###Their Springs and Summers are pretty mild , too . E_S ###It never gets real , real hot . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I 'll have *-1 to try that out because I had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###And , uh , I 've just never really been in that region of the country E_S 
70054:26	###Maybe we can send you some . E_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Because we could sure use it . E_S ###Well , you think 0 that takes care of the time ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###I think 0 that will do it . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###Okay . E_S 
70085:4	###Well , it 's an older home . E_S ###It was made *-1 back in the early sixties . E_S ###It 's a pier beam house . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###* Got three bedrooms , one bath ###and that just makes me scream . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###That 's pretty tough . E_S 
70127:63	###SpeakerA15 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###Oh , that 's nice . E_S ###Because I have just like \[ a very small , \+ ###you know , those basic tract \] houses , ###like that . E_S ###We have a very small yard E_S ###and , um , I do have garden , E_S ###but it 's extremely small , E_S ###but , uh , it seems like , though , for your area \[ that , \+ that \] is sort of different . E_S 
70169:19	###Yeah . E_S ###That 's really it . E_S ###That 's a plus . E_S ###At least we do have like three walk-in closets here . E_S ###So \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] maybe not so typical , E_S ###but , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###It helps a bunch . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S 
70208:30	###SpeakerB36 . ###Well , \[ I , \+ I \] enjoy that though . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###Do you . E_S ###You must have more time \[ than , \+ than \] I have *?* . E_S ###I 'm sitting out here right now . E_S ###We had this terrible rain E_S 
70316:18	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###in the garden I 've got my beans , peas , E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###I 've got some onions *ICH*-1 out , tomatoes , E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . 
70325:9	###SpeakerB70 . ###I 'm not real sure what they 're going *-1 to do *T*-2 this year . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###I never have much luck with tomatoes . E_S ###I do plant a lot of beans , because it seems like , the , uh , bugs get on them so easily E_S ###and I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that , E_S ###so , the only thing that I use *T*-1 is soap . E_S ###I water , you know , spray the plants , because they say , 0 supposedly , that will keep the bugs off them . E_S ###But , uh , I do n't have luck with that tomato plant , E_S ###so I hate *-1 to spray them with anything . E_S 
70343:5	###and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time , E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###That 's true . E_S ###That 's true . E_S ###My dad is a farmer E_S ###so , I 've heard him talk about that forever . E_S ###I guess 0 it works , E_S ###but , um , you have *-1 to really wash your vegetables after that E_S ###so it wo n't make you sick . E_S ###* Let 's see 
70397:13	###SpeakerB92 . ###SpeakerA93 . ###That 's right . E_S ###It does not make for a happy situation . E_S ###That 's true . E_S ###Well , do you have any children ? E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###I 've got one . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###One child . E_S 
70407:24	###And they enjoy where they 're living *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###We 'll , N_S ###he 's nine months old . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Oh , so he does n't know , right . E_S ###I guess , 0 he 's a big help out in your garden . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###He likes *-1 to dig around a little bit . E_S 
70422:27	###That 's right . E_S ###It 's healthy , E_S ###why not . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###He was eating the dirt , E_S ###I would n't worry about it . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###No . E_S ###It wo n't hurt them . E_S 
70430:16	###No . E_S ###It wo n't hurt them . E_S ###I was a big dirt eater , supposedly , when I was a child *T*-1 E_S ###and I turned out okay , E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###SpeakerA105 . ###so , * do n't worry about it . E_S ###Just * let him enjoy himself . E_S ###So you think that you want *-1 to move away from the big city , uh ? E_S ###SpeakerB106 .

70517:14	###Uh , that God because , \[ it never occurred to \+ , it never occurred to \] us that it would take seven months . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###That was smart . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA33 .

74315:10	###SpeakerB63 . ###Uh , just something 0 *T*-1 to , i- , N_S ###rather than * throw someone \[ in , \+ into \] that environment , uh , you know , it N_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Yeah .

75254:60	###SpeakerB124 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Uh , I was almost thirty before I got off this continent . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###And , uh , both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###Yeah . E_S 
75287:10	###but \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff I 'd say 0 probably the police department would claim 0 the number one \[ crimes , \+ crimes \] are probably solicitation of prostitution , uh , and sale of drugs . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###\[ Prob- , \+ probably \] right , if you look at it from that stand point . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###What , uh , N_S ###is there anything , uh , that you particularly are concerned with *T*-2 in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
75298:5	###I mean I can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have *-1 to worry about it . E_S ###Uh , but I do have friends that *T*-1 live in the city E_S ###and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing . Uh , just because there are , like , crack houses , you know , on their street and stuff like this . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Do you live in a real small town \[ or , \+ or \] out in the country ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###I live out in the country , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
75303:29	###Do you live in a real small town \[ or , \+ or \] out in the country ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###I live out in the country , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###How far out from the city , I mean , do you , N_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###I 'm about fifteen miles out . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###About fifteen miles . E_S 
75343:37	###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###It 's cut back , you know , considerably , E_S ###but \[ it , \+ it \] just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood , E_S ###so it still , uh , remains city wide , \[ pretty , \+ pretty \] high . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
75352:4	###SpeakerB32 . ###\[ Are there , \+ are there \] any theories on why this is happening *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh , I would say 0 the majority of it 's happening during the day , uh , between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Most , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###But why ? E_S 
75387:9	###the , you know , Mercedes , Volvos , things that they can get , you know , big dollars for *T*-1 and the jewelry are the major targets , E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###guns , that sort of stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Very few , you know , \[ penny , \+ penny \] ante stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
75393:66	###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Very few , you know , \[ penny , \+ penny \] ante stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Well , what do you think 0 *T*-1 can be done *-2 * to reduce that sort of crime ? E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Well , uh , the police force , for one , E_S ###I think 0 they could , uh , definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use *T*-1 . E_S ###Uh , it 's , E_S ###oh , right now I think 0 *T*-1 , we are about thirty thousand people E_S 
75408:15	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###But , I mean , that 's going *-1 to tend *-2 to , N_S ###I mean it seems to me 0 that sort of approach will tend *-1 to simply make the cost of * committing the crime slightly higher , E_S ###in other words , you 've increased the probability of somebody being caught *-1 a little bit . E_S 
75419:15	###SpeakerA61 . ###Well , the , N_S ###course in our particular state , uh , we have the prison overcrowding , whatever , E_S ###so they 're giving the early release , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Right . E_S ###They 're doing that in our state , too . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] it 's , N_S 
75432:24	###So you think 0 that would be a deterrent ? E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###That would \[ be , \+ certainly be \] a deterrent . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And , uh , not necessarily , you know , give in to their , uh , human rights desires . E_S ###You know , if they 're overcrowded , just keep * cramming them in there till they just suffocate . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB68 . 
75526:40	###SpeakerB106 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's too bad . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###\[ And , \+ uh , you know , and \] \[ they 're \+ , right now they 're \] reluctant *-1 to go after him because \[ \[ they 're , \+ you know , they 're , \] \+ they 're \] repeat offenders , E_S ###they , uh , been in jail before , E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . 
75556:16	###SpeakerB120 . ###That 's awful . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###and he goes out and commits it again . E_S ###Fact , he 's back in jail now . E_S ###So , \[ what , \+ what , \] uh , N_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###* Gives you sympathy for the vigilantes . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###Yeah . E_S 
75565:37	###Yeah . E_S ###\[ What , \+ what \] deterrent does he really have *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 \[ in our , \+ in our \] particular neighborhood , vigilantism is becoming a \[ real , \+ real \] possibility . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###Uh-huh .

75570:25	###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 \[ in our , \+ in our \] particular neighborhood , vigilantism is becoming a \[ real , \+ real \] possibility . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###Uh , we 've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually , you know , shot the people *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###Oh , my God . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###and , uh , return offenders have , N_S 
75603:22	###SpeakerB140 . ###And \[ that , \+ that 's \] a deterrent , too . If you think 0 the home owner might be armed , right , and awake E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB142 . ###here you break in , E_S ###and you 're going *-1 to get shot *-2 .

75634:73	###it 's not many from the local communities . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###Uh-huh .

76183:18	###Um , and , it 's seen *-1 more so because when you call parents up *T*-2 , many parents wo n't even recognize that there is a problem E_S ###and \[ I 'll say , \+ they 'll say , \] oh , well , \[ our kids , \+ my kid , \] E_S ###I 've never heard anything about this before .

77404:5	###SpeakerB61 . ###Well , it lo- , N_S o- , N_S ###the one trend I would say 0 *T*-1 is that with so many more women choosing professional careers , there are fewer of them home in the afternoons , E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###and I do n't think 0 it needs *-1 to be the mothers , E_S ###but I think 0 it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours .

E_S ###SpeakerB71 . 
77439:7	###No , E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] realize that , E_S ###but it 's funny , E_S ###they do n't always do it , E_S ###but occasionally they do , E_S ###and you want , N_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . 
77443:68	###but occasionally they do , E_S ###and you want , N_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###and when they do *T*-1 , there 's a reason for it , that they 're sharing it *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . 
77454:4	###SpeakerB77 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###and it was , uh , N_S ###you just felt , gee , if I were n't here , how , N_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###Uh-huh E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###\[ or , \+ or \] if my husband , N_S ###SpeakerB81 .

E_S ###Uh , but \[ it has been , \+ um , it 's been \] interesting \[ and \+ \] particularly \[ I , \+ I \] think because the society in which we live *T*-1 , families are separated . E_S ###You do n't have grandparents *ICH*-1 near by or aunts and uncles . E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA86 . 
77496:21	###SpeakerB93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA94 . ###Um , and it was sort of an Italian family , E_S ###SpeakerB95 . ###Um .

E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###SpeakerB99 . 
77544:50	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA114 . ###so \[ we , \+ we \] try *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] do it as well as we can *?* .

77567:71	###Well , \[ we 've always , \+ we have had \] this tradition , um , that we always go out before Christmas and cut our own tree . E_S ###SpeakerB121 . ###Uh-huh .

77608:37	###SpeakerB139 . ###How nice . E_S ###SpeakerA140 . ###And , I mean , they look today *-1 as new as they did when \[ they gave them to , \+ she gave them to \] us *T*-2 , E_S ###and there 's a ring E_S ###and you buy a present , E_S ###SpeakerB141 . ###Oh , I see .

78095:5	###SpeakerA19 . ###y- , Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's \[ neat , \+ neat \] . E_S 
78130:17	###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh , and we could n't get enough people together , uh , *-1 to go , E_S ###so it ended up \[ falling a- , \+ *-1 falling through . \] E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###We were going *-1 to get a really good price . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
78164:17	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###so \[ any , \+ any \] vacation that we go on *T*-1 is usually , \[ involves , \+ \] close to the ocean , \[ or , \+ or \] something like that . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###It 's got *-1 to be the water . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###SpeakerA57 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . 
78194:75	###SpeakerB70 . ###\[ we like the , \+ we like the \] white mountains E_S ###and , Uh , unfortunately , I did n't really get *-1 to go *-2 skiing much while I was there . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###I went *-1 skiing once . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ we loved the , \+ we loved \[ the , \+ the \] \] New Jersey area , too , because \[ the \+ the \] lakes were really pretty close , you know , E_S 
78199:30	###SpeakerB72 . ###I went *-1 skiing once . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ we loved the , \+ we loved \[ the , \+ the \] \] New Jersey area , too , because \[ the \+ the \] lakes were really pretty close , you know , E_S ###\[ you could , \+ you could \] drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail \[ and , \+ and \] just really *T*-1 , N_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###and then we were n't too for from the Appalachian Trail , E_S 
78207:83	###SpeakerA75 . ###and then we were n't too for from the Appalachian Trail , E_S ###we did quite a bit of hiking , E_S which *T*-1 is kind of fun . E_S ###Are \[ you a , \+ you a \] hiker , or not ? E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Not so much , huh ? E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###\[ Not , \+ not \] really so much . E_S 
78233:64	###SpeakerA85 . ###Okay , E_S ###then that 's probably one of the reasons 0 our , N_S ###we had little children all the time , E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###so some of the things are not \[ as , \+ quite as , \] uh , adaptable . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah , E_S 
78260:21	###SpeakerA95 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###SpeakerA97 . ###Eleven or twelve , I would think *T*-1 , probably E_S ###but , maybe fifteen even . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###I know that , uh , uh , \[ one of , \+ one \] thing that *T*-1 happens \[ to us \+ to \] vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family . E_S 
78265:43	###but , maybe fifteen even . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###I know that , uh , uh , \[ one of , \+ one \] thing that *T*-1 happens \[ to us \+ to \] vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family . E_S ###You know , we go wherever somebody *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 , that we have n't seen *T*-3 for a while . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh .

Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###and so that was fun , E_S 
78292:58	###SpeakerB110 . ###that there were several hundred , uh , people E_S ###and they all kind of met at a central place . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] did n't go , E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Um .

78363:88	###and , you know , he 'll say , 0 this is my itinerary . E_S ###I 'm going here , here and here E_S ###and I 'll be back in about two months . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###Yeah .

78375:64	###interesting things 0 * to N_S ###so , you know . N_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###so , N_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###Have you been \[ a , \+ to a \] lot of the different historical sites ? E_S ###SpeakerA147 . ###Yeah , E_S 
78396:32	###\[ I \+ I \] think 0 \[ right , \+ right \] now while my husband and I do n't have any kids we 'll probably take as many vacations as we can *?* * doing things like scuba diving \[ and , \+ and \] adventurous types of things , E_S ###SpeakerA151 . ###It was really interesting . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB152 . ###SpeakerA153 . ###SpeakerB154 . ###SpeakerA155 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB156 . 
78410:21	###Now , \[ his , \+ his \] folks did a lot of traveling across country . E_S ###You know they went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that . E_S ###SpeakerA159 . ###Well , now , camping is fun with kids . E_S ###If you 're , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB160 . ###Yeah .

78481:16	###Unless you have something 0 *T*-1 to do with it . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###But the problem is , that I am very liberal politically E_S ###and so I hardly ever have anybody that *T*-1 wins that I vote for *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Oh , liberal , E_S 
78491:30	###\[ by , \+ what do you mean *T*-1 by \] liberal , um . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Liberal politically , E_S ###I 'm , you know , like pretty left wing \[ Demo- , \+ Democrat , \] E_S ###so .

E_S ###Uh , one of the books that I bought *T*-1 , where it 's \[ d- , \+ describing \] the sponge painting *T*-2 , said 0 you can like layer different colors E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yes , E_S ###yeah , E_S 
80352:27	###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and in between there was a sort of a rust , uh , put * on very sparingly . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Ugh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###And it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S 
80367:43	###and I 'm changing \[ \[ \[ the , \+ like the towel racks and stuff , \] \+ the , \] \+ the \] fixtures out * to make them wood , E_S ###I 'm going *-1 to put wood in there . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###that should be nice . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###So it 's going *-1 to have kind of a country look . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
80380:37	###SpeakerA25 . ###Well , uh . N_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Um , it 's going *-1 to be a big experiment . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I was about *-1 to say , 0 you ought *-2 to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
80399:38	###I have n't ever done fancy painting E_S ###but I sure did my share of just regular painting . E_S ###Uh , I 've painted several houses , inside . E_S ###No- , N_S ###I , never painted the outside . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###inside . N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . 
80408:71	###SpeakerB36 . ###\[ \[ What , \+ what kind of , \] \+ what kind of \] paint do you normally use *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Well , uh , we used a latex , uh , wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork E_S ###and my job was mostly the woodwork . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Okay , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###My husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers E_S 
80426:55	###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Um , I 'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken *-1 down first . Because \[ I , \+ I \] think , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Well I was going *-1 to ask if you planned *-2 to paint over it or try *-3 to strip it . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###No , E_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] planning on *-1 taking it off . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . 
80440:33	###Um , I tried *-1 to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago , oh , with a just a scraper and wet sponge E_S ###and it took forever . E_S ###I would not recommend that method . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh , \[ if \+ if you can rent a steamer , \] if it 's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Well that 's something \[ that , \+ that * 's \] worthwhile * checking into *T*-1 then . 'Cause I , N_S ###SpeakerA53 . 
80490:38	###Well \[ \[ I , \+ I 've also been *-4 thinking about , \] \+ after * looking at all \[ these magazines , \+ um , these design magazines \] and stuff , I 'm thinking about \] maybe *-1 painting the bedroom walls too , in a color that *T*-2 will kind of , um , tie in \[ \[ our , \+ um , our , \] \+ um , our , \] uh , comforter , with a color that *T*-3 's kind of a , um , burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh .

80505:155	###SpeakerA73 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###It would n't be any kind of \[ special , \+ um , special \] effects type thing . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###It would be just plain paint . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Well it 's not hard 0 * to do *T*-1 if you get everything prepared *-2 ahead of time . E_S 
80520:69	###SpeakerA79 . ###you can wash up easily because they 're water soluble . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB84 . 
80541:23	###okay . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###You do n't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried *-1 to hard . E_S ###That 's the problem . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###It will come up a lot easier if you do n't wait too long . E_S ###And \[ I 've , \+ I was \] told *-1 , N_S ###I always used the nice wide masking tape , E_S 
80552:60	###SpeakerB90 . ###Oh really , E_S ###okay . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###and then you end up *-1 tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###And the whole point of * using it is * to save yourself work . E_S ###You can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape . E_S 
80573:19	###and I decided 0 that was too much 0 * to tackle *T*-1 , E_S ###I 'd hire a professional . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###\[ If you were , \+ if you were \] closer \[ \[ I 'd , \+ I 'd , \] \+ I 'd \] tell you 0 you could come over and supervise .

80609:26	###Well , \[ I , \+ I \] do about the same , I guess 0 *T*-1 , but in a different fashion .

80642:28	###SpeakerA14 . ###I find that I 'm leaning on , uh , N_S ###I travel a great deal , uh , even overseas , E_S ###and I find that I lean on , uh , C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff .

E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay , E_S ###I live in Plano , in a four bedroom , two bath house , which *T*-1 is ###the area 's dominantly three bedroom , two bath .

81459:11	###I suppose 0 we still only have three effective bedrooms E_S ###but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of *-1 enclosing the garage .

81479:4	###The only thing about mine , um , I think 0 there 's probably about , oh , ###when I go down the street *T*-3 I can just pick out houses \[ that *T*-1 are , \+ that *T*-2 are \] identical to mine E_S ###and usually they are the four bedroom , um , E_S ###but they 're spaced *-1 out , oh I 'd say *ICH*-2 maybe three , on a two block period . E_S ###Because it 's all different builders up here . E_S ###So it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard at that point * to , you know , classify some of the builders .

E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Uh , cathedral ceilings . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###And , uh , the kitchen is norm E_S ###and the bedrooms are norm .

E_S ###\[ It just , \+ it 's , \] uh , N_S ###luckily I came from a house in Colorado which *T*-1 had the cathedral ceiling E_S ###and I just lucked out and walked into this one E_S 
81517:11	###and he 's six foot . E_S ###And he says , oh , * come on up mom . ###I 'm not going up there . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###SpeakerA18 . ###I 'm not going up there , E_S ###but he says 0 there 's plenty of room up there for a room .

E_S ###I tol- , N_S 
81531:46	###\[ \[ ninety , \+ I would say 0 \[ about , \+ oh , about \] ninety-five \] percent , \+ no I guess 0 \[ may- , \+ probably \] a hundred percent \] of them all are mostly brick , uh , with some wood .

82352:10	###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###and so . N_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Uh , we had started out like that E_S ###and , um , I think 0 that was really ideal , uh . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I do to , E_S ###I agree , E_S 
82374:19	###SpeakerA56 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###\[ \[ I 'm , \+ I 've , \] \+ I 've \] lived here forever , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I me- , I live in Germantown , E_S ###and , uh . N_S 
82408:4	###Well , um , I do n't know , E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ uh , we , \] \+ we \] do a lot of things on the weekends together , the family , E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah .

82439:166	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###but , um . N_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###Yeah , E_S ###what , uh , N_S ###my wife did some teaching at \[ like , \+ uh , like \] a private tutoring place . A Sylvan Learning Center this year E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . 
82478:26	###SpeakerB95 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA96 . ###And I 'm not able *-1 to work during the week , uh , because of that .

82542:21	###\[ I 'm , \+ I , \] you know N_S ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] hard because , you know , N_S ###then you 're not getting *-1 to spend as much time \[ with , \+ at \] home , E_S ###I mean your husband is not getting *-1 to spend as much time *ICH*-2 at home as he 'd want *-3 to *?* .

82567:8	###I 'm getting out . E_S ###SpeakerA126 . ###I know .

82583:32	###SpeakerB133 . ###And so I think 0 that 's \[ le- , \+ tended *-1 to lead \] to a decline \[ in , \+ in \] families and family values especially .

82621:36	###SpeakerB147 . ###Well , you know , in the next year or so , you 'll see so many instances where , you know , he 'll mimic something that you 've done *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S ###and you see , you know , everything 0 I 'm doing *T*-1 , he 's learning from *T*-2 .

82629:76	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB151 . ###You know , \[ th- , \+ that 's \] how they 're developing their patterns *T*-1 .

82641:18	###Yeah E_S ###eventually . E_S ###SpeakerA156 . ###SpeakerB157 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA158 . ###but it , um , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] know , E_S ###even just this first year , that I 've been with , uh , my son , \[ h- , \+ here *T*-1 , \] um , he 's , N_S 
82689:17	###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###However , there are solutions to it . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
82698:11	###SpeakerA9 . ###And foremost , uh , where we compare \[ w- , \+ that we \] are now doing fifty percent of our , uh , people are voting . E_S ###Uh , we 're probably making a comparison against , uh , some European \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] uh , uh , s-s-say , newer republics \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 have very high percentages . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh , so , uh , \[ \[ one of the reasons , uh , that , \+ uh , \[ o- , \+ one \] of the reasons that \] we could get , \+ uh , one of the reasons that it is \] lower in the United States *T*-1 is that mostly we hold it on Tuesdays . E_S 
82716:107	###\[ Most people , \+ uh , a great number of people \] now work \[ at various , \+ at different \] jobs that , ###if a third of the people are shift workers , they wo n't be able *-1 to get \[ to the , \+ to the \] polls in any case . If they , uh , have *-2 to work late into the evening and not get up . E_S ###My solution to that is that we hold it on Sundays . As do probably sixty to seventy percent of the European countries now . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###Oh , really , E_S ###they hold it on the weekends ? E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
82748:39	###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . ###No , E_S ###I always vote . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Well , I have absentee voted in , uh , New Hampshire , E_S

82893:5	###I mean , you know , you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Huh .

83164:18	###With a conviction ? E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###That most of it is plea bargained *-1 , uh , half way through E_S ###\[ or , \+ or \] most of the cases are plea bargained *-1 anyway . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
83169:24	###That most of it is plea bargained *-1 , uh , half way through E_S ###\[ or , \+ or \] most of the cases are plea bargained *-1 anyway . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Right .

83187:88	###it was not any serious crimes . E_S ###So apparently even for the smallest crimes , they give the person \[ the , \+ you know , any \] felony anyways . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , I guess 0 we , N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###\[ Th- , \+ they \] give the person the option for a jury . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah .

83199:26	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###* Takes a heck of a long time , I guess , * to get there in some states . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do not know , uh , E_S 
83225:16	###Yeah . E_S ###Whatever . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###So it seems , uh , N_S ###no , E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do not think 0 I would change it . E_S ###The more 0 I verbalize it *T*-2 , \[ I , \+ I \] do not think 0 I would want *-1 to change the system . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Right , E_S ###SpeakerA63 . 
83241:38	###I know , E_S ###it , uh , does seem like \[ \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the , \] \+ the \] purpose of * getting people in jail so that , you know , \[ the , \+ the , \] N_S ###I can not think of the word 0 I am looking for *T*-1 .

83254:116	###SpeakerB70 . ###You know , people that , N_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###I mean the prison population , uh , as far as \[ I , \+ I , \] uh , you know , N_S ###my impression of it is \[ that it has , \+ that it has \] doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty .

83261:35	###SpeakerA73 . ###I mean it , E_S ###\[ so has our , \+ I guess 0 our population has \] grown some too .

E_S ###I mean I do no think 0 I could handle prison . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###I mean it would be very difficult , E_S ###SpeakerB76 . 
83276:74	###SpeakerB80 . ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###\[ But , \+ but \] there again \[ I , \+ I \] do not know if \[ the , \+ the \] jury system itself , uh , comes in * to play there .

83379:43	###Uh-huh . E_S ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Hi , E_S ###my last , uh , auto repair was \[ my , \+ my , \] uh , alternator went out . E_S ###I have a nineteen eighty-six Toyota , uh , E_S ###it 's a little Tercel . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . 
83396:5	###and \[ they 're , \+ they 're , \] uh , very reasonable . E_S ###So , uh , I bought the alternator , E_S ###we \[ p- , \+ put \] it on the car E_S ###and \[ it , \+ it \] did n't work , E_S ###and it blew out all the fuses . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Oh , no . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
83419:85	###so \[ we , \+ we \] went back and tried it again , put it on again E_S ###and it still did n't work , E_S ###and we took the car up to , um , a little place called * Pep Boys , E_S ###I do n't know if you have them in your area E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###but , uh , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] pretty reasonable , uh , car repair place also .

83439:46	###I guess so E_S ###and \[ that was my , \+ that was my \] last experience . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Well I had a weird , N_S ###there 's a little sensing device , uh , \[ in front of my , \+ uh , um , I 'm not sure , right in front of \] the \[ f- , \+ fan , \] E_S ###\[ it 's a , \+ it 's an \] air conditioner sensing device . E_S ###I do n't know why , E_S ###it actually , N_S ###there 's a metal piece that *T*-1 fits through the belts , uh , E_S ###and somehow that broke off E_S 
83488:4	###as far as any maintenance on my car , \[ I , \+ I \] shy away from the oil changes , E_S ###that 's for sure . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###well my car \[ is , \+ uh , it 's \] an eighty-six E_S ###and I really had n't had \[ any , \+ any \] trouble with it \[ un- , \+ until \] that E_S ###and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , and \] this was just recent , E_S ###so I really ca n't complain about this one .

E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] figured 0 maybe I 'd get one or two years out of it , E_S ###\[ an I , \+ an I \] did get a couple of good years out of it E_S ###and \[ the , \+ uh , the \] engine messed up on me E_S 
83602:35	###SpeakerA65 . ###I , N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###I was driving a sixty-six Plymouth Fury . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Wow . E_S ###I think 0 those old cars \[ might , \+ might \] be a pretty good bet because you , N_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S 
83641:20	###and some people will still buy them , you know , E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###they 'll , N_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ it *EXP*-1 's easy * to , \+ it 's easy , \] \+ I guess 0 it *EXP*-2 's still easy \] * to find engines for those cars , engines and transmissions E_S ###and \[ if you , \+ I guess 0 if you \] keep *-1 \[ trad- , \+ changing \] them out you can keep a car for a long time . E_S ###Course I guess 0 I could do the same thing with \[ the , \+ the \] Toyota that I have *T*-1 , E_S 
83688:35	###It seems like we are doing it here forever . E_S ###We bought \[ a , \+ a \] large house that *T*-1 was completely unlandscaped .

E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And we hired a professional landscaper to do it . E_S 
83692:52	###SpeakerB14 . ###That was all that *T*-1 was there . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And we hired a professional landscaper to do it . E_S ###And I have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done *T*-1 because it has always been incorrectly planted *-2 E_S ###or the plants do not make the winter time . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . 
83699:10	###or the plants do not make the winter time . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###And so I am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going *-1 to do *T*-2 is 0 we are just going *-3 to struggle through the rest of this year , probably through the Fall too . And , uh , \[ rip up , \+ rip out \] all the rest of these junipers or anything that *T*-4 requires , uh , more care than I am willing * to give the kids *T*-5 and replace it with hollies . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . 
83708:28	###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh , how many kids do you have *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Just two , E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###but they are just eighteen months apart ###so it seems like a lot more . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
83770:19	###But * just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts . E_S ###I do not like it . E_S ###And I just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff .

84467:36	###Um , and that is a very , N_S ###we had never been there . E_S ###That is a very , very neat town 0 * to visit *T*-1 .

84510:32	###They went back to her dorm room E_S ###SpeakerB125 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA126 . ###and date rape . E_S ###I mean , and it just , N_S ###\[ sh- , \+ she \] looked anguished .

84619:16	###So , N_S ###SpeakerB165 . ###I think 0 our justice system needs *-1 to be stricter .

84660:21	###I have \] not been out of school that long , E_S ###but it has been at least ten years . E_S ###And you think to yourself , was it that bad back then ? E_S ###Or is it just , N_S ###I think that , like you said , television ? E_S ###Is it just that more people think 0 there is like excitement in it , you know ? E_S ###I mean , people that *T*-1 may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something . E_S ###SpeakerB179 . ###It seems like a lot of , i- , N_S that it is more , ###like in Boston , E_S there was a case of , uh , a couple of kids , fifteen year olds . E_S

84691:14	###SpeakerB187 . ###SpeakerA188 . ###You know , it is just , ###I think 0 kids get too much too fast . And all those sort of things . E_S ###SpeakerB189 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA190 . ###SpeakerB191 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA192 . 
84711:69	###SpeakerA198 . ###Right . E_S ###\[ Or the , \+ or the \] jackets , the team like the Raiders and the caps . E_S ###SpeakerB199 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA200 . ###SpeakerB201 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA202 . ###You know , * stealing the hundred dollar jackets . E_S

84717:4	###SpeakerB201 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA202 . ###You know , * stealing the hundred dollar jackets . E_S ###Uh , I mean , it is I guess , it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that \[ they , \+ in Boston . \] E_S ###That is crime where they videoed *T*-1 . E_S ###That is probably one of the most bizarre 0 I have heard of *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB203 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA204 . 
84722:76	###That is crime where they videoed *T*-1 . E_S ###That is probably one of the most bizarre 0 I have heard of *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB203 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA204 . ###Where they videotape themselves *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB205 . ###Yeah . E_S ###It seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like , you know , be ...

84723:4	###That is probably one of the most bizarre 0 I have heard of *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB203 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA204 . ###Where they videotape themselves *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB205 . ###Yeah . E_S ###It seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like , you know , be ... N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , Wayne , I , uh , feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children , and making time available even sometimes when time is n't available *T*-1 . E_S 
84741:52	###one is two and a half E_S ###and one 's nine months , E_S ###and , uh , that age , of course , everything 0 you do *T*-1 they 're trying *-2 to learn *-3 to do , E_S ###and so , uh , it *EXP*-1 's important for you * to spend time * doing the things that you want them to learn *T*-2 , you know , \[ that , \+ that \] they need *-3 to learn *T*-4 at the age , you know * \[ reading , and , \+ uh , reading and \] playing nice with others , and that sort of thing . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we went through this with our children , and now with our grandchildren , E_S 
84753:23	###and we 've always , uh , oh tried *-1 to take our children and \[ no- , \+ now \] at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able *-3 to *?* *T*-2 . E_S ###I think 0 that 's just part of their overall educational process , is * to get out and see and do things . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Right , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###And so , it 's uh , N_S ###we have , uh , lived several places around the U S E_S 
84754:8	###I think 0 that 's just part of their overall educational process , is * to get out and see and do things . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Right , E_S ###uh-huh .

E_S ###And so , it 's uh , N_S ###we have , uh , lived several places around the U S E_S ###and \[ we have , \+ where we 've \] lived *T*-1 , we 've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area , E_S

E_S 
84777:45	###Yeah , E_S ###it certainly does , because , uh , you know , the things in the books seem so dead to the kids , you know , unless they 've actually been there or whatever , E_S ###because I remember our family , well , \[ \[ we , \+ we , \] \+ we \] went everywhere .

84798:68	###And even now with my grandchildren , I feel 0 it 's a very important thing 0 *T*-1 to be done *-2 .

85104:20	###\[ So , \+ uh , but \] it is something that *T*-1 's a little frightening E_S ###and in fact , well , I , N_S ###within our family we have said , N_S ###my husband , N_S ###I have two sons , ###uh , well , E_S one is already in college in New England , E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah .

85220:25	###we have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , I guess 0 the best 0 I can do *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is , \] uh , * compare apartments . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###SpeakerA12 . ###If it can compare the one that I have *T*-1 now , with the one that I had *T*-2 the last time , the one that I have *T*-3 now , uh , has a lot more amenities , I guess 0 * is the right word , than the one that I moved out of *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###SpeakerA14 . ###Uh , this one , you know , gave us free cable and , uh , ceiling fans E_S 
85237:22	###No , E_S ###it 's not a high-rise . E_S ###It 's just \[ a , \+ a \] two story building . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Uh , but \[ \[ there 's , \+ you know , there , \] \+ there are \] a lot of buildings E_S ###but it 's just two stories . E_S ###Uh , on the second floor \[ they have , \+ they do n't have \] a patio E_S ###but they have a sunroom instead of the patio . E_S 
85283:44	###So , * tell me ab- , N_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 've always , uh , been pretty lucky . E_S ###The real estate out here 's been pretty good . E_S ###\[ \[ \[ It , \+ uh , the , \] \+ the prices of , \] \+ well , the prices \] came down last year . E_S ###\[ We 've , \+ we had \] sort of like a Dallas syndrome .

85292:20	###SpeakerB35 . ###The past , uh , uh , year and a half prices have gone down which *T*-1 is totally new for northern Virginia . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###\[ It just , \+ It 's \] a real good , N_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###It just never happened before . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###SpeakerB39 . ###So it 's really surprising everybody . E_S 
85326:12	###One thing about the houses \[ in , \+ uh , in \] Dallas , they do n't , uh , utilize basements the way 0 they did in New York *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###SpeakerA50 . ###My parents in New York had , uh , a , uh , three family house . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Actual MUMBLEx a , N_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###SpeakerA54 . 
85345:14	###and they were able *-1 to rent that out also . E_S ###But , uh , in Dallas \[ \[ I , \+ I just , \] \+ I just \] have n't seen basements in houses . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###And I 've looked at a lot of them , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###Yeah , E_S ###a friend of mine was thinking about *-1 coming down there , E_S 
85372:42	###Is there a lot of sand in , N_S ###I always think 0 it 's like a desert , E_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###MUMBLEx Dallas always , N_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###Well , no . E_S ###No , E_S ###no , E_S ###no , E_S ###you know , I do n't see that kind of sand here . 
85377:80	###Well , no . E_S ###No , E_S ###no , E_S ###no , E_S ###you know , I do n't see that kind of sand here . ###Um , E_S there are some areas *ICH*-2 though \[ where , \+ where \] they have a problem with , uh , the houses kind of sinking a little bit \[ into the , \+ to the , \] uh *T*-1 , N_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . ###or the foundation is sinking or something . You know , \[ just a little , \+ just a little \] bit , some more than others . E_S 
85385:45	###SpeakerA72 . ###or the foundation is sinking or something . You know , \[ just a little , \+ just a little \] bit , some more than others . E_S ###But \[ you , \+ you \] have *-1 to know the right spot , 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] pick *T*-3 where that does n't happen *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###SpeakerA74 . ###SpeakerB75 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###And , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB77 . 
85395:16	###Well , out here \[ we , \+ um , we \] live in what *T*-1 used *-2 to be , uh , like a prairie or whatever a \[ natural , \+ you know , natural \] grasslands . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###And , uh , they , N_S ###it 's just , 0 you go down four inches E_S ###and \[ you get to sands- , \+ well , fourteen inches you get to sandstone . \] E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . 
85402:4	###SpeakerA80 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###And so any place where they put a basement in *T*-1 they had *-2 to blast . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###It 's just solid sandstone . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###Huh . E_S 
85452:11	###But , uh , that 's the same way out here E_S ###because , um , well , \[ we , \+ for example , \[ and \+ \] we \] live fifteen miles from the beltway that *T*-1 surrounds Washington E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB99 . ###and anything instead \[ that beltway , \+ the highway , \] the real estate 's forty thousand dollars more expensive . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###Yeah .

85497:25	###there 's another one \[ half an acre away , \+ or a quarter acre away \] rather . E_S ###SpeakerA114 . ###Oh .

85570:16	###That will be fine . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , hi , . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Hi . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Good morning . ###Um , E_S \[ I think \+ I mean , \[ if , \+ if \] I start \] this I just wanted *-1 to say that , um , one of the things that I do n't think 0 we really understood *T*-2 about \[ the , \+ the \] middle eastern situation is that they 're a totally different type of people than we are *?* , E_S ###and I mean they think differently E_S 
85613:60	###And \[ that 's , \+ i- , \] you know , N_S ###if , N_S ###somewhere in there someone 's going *-1 to have *-2 to learn a different way . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###That 's , N_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###You know , \[ an , \+ an , \] \[ I , \+ I \] think that , um , N_S ###true we do have completely different ways of * looking \[ at things , \+ at a lot of things , \] E_S ###but , uh , at the same time , I think 0 \[ there are a lot of , \+ there is a lot of \] good that the United States and other countries can do *T*-1 , as far as example E_S 
85613:82	###And \[ that 's , \+ i- , \] you know , N_S ###if , N_S ###somewhere in there someone 's going *-1 to have *-2 to learn a different way . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###That 's , N_S ###yeah .

85659:38	###SpeakerB44 . ###And so \[ at that , \+ at that , \] you have *-1 to work at their level , to an extent , too . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###It 's , N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that , \+ that 's \] true too , E_S ###I , um . N_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
85675:19	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###They love violent leaders , to , you know , E_S ###I mean * look at , you know , the leader 0 they had *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ They , \+ they \] just adored him , because he was so strict and cruel , E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah .

85684:69	###SpeakerB54 . ###I ca n't figure out why they adored him *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Well it has a lot 0 * to do *T*-1 with their religion . E_S ###I got *-1 to say , that over there , um , N_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yes , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###and I know this only because from personal experience that I 'm speaking of this , E_S 
85696:17	###and I mean \[ he is just overly , \+ \[ he , \+ he \] is abounding \] in kindness , * let 's say 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###And his wife is so godly ###, I mean , every thought , E_S ###they have a totally different life than we have *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . 
85709:5	###SpeakerA63 . ###And they have very basic life , um , E_S ###well it 's just a very basic life E_S ###and they just really believe in Allah , or God , or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###And \[ it 's , \+ you know , everything is \] to the glory of Allah , E_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ you know , and , \] \[ it , \+ it 's \] almost like , N_S ###SpeakerB66 . 
85724:4	###SpeakerA69 . ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###yes , E_S ###and they abuse that . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###And it 's always been military E_S ###and it 's always been *?* , E_S ###and \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] always been the way of the world . Do n't you think . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . 
85727:20	###yes , E_S ###and they abuse that . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###And it 's always been military E_S ###and it 's always been *?* , E_S ###and \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] always been the way of the world . Do n't you think . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Which I think that *T*-2 that 's not \[ the , \+ the \] way 0 the majority of the people over there really are *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S 
85729:176	###SpeakerA71 . ###And it 's always been military E_S ###and it 's always been *?* , E_S ###and \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] always been the way of the world . Do n't you think .

E_S ###So it 's really hard , when you see the leaders , compared to the people *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . 
85730:25	###And it 's always been military E_S ###and it 's always been *?* , E_S ###and \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] always been the way of the world . Do n't you think .

E_S ###So it 's really hard , when you see the leaders , compared to the people *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###But \[ I think 0 \[ in a , \+ in a \] way the war , \+ uh , I think 0 in a way all , the involvement \] over there too , though , has shown \[ a lot of people \+ that there are a lot of people \] that *T*-1 do n't follow what those few are doing *T*-2 . E_S 
85752:16	###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###\[ And , \+ and , \] the , you know , N_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###it just really comes down to people are people , you know , E_S ###you have *-1 to have some compassion some humanness . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA83 .

86799:5	###there 's pockets of violence that *T*-1 is so violent that they , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###It just really grabs your attention . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah .

86884:98	###SpeakerA43 . ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah .

86933:45	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And , just , N_S ###it seems anymore that , uh , \[ if , \+ if \] you have , you know , this type of a moral stance , that people come down on you .

87758:51	###Yeah , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###And , uh , most people are that way . Because they 're used to *-1 not having public transportation . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 .

89930:134	###It 's , uh , a book about , uh , the Bermuda Triangle , E_S ###but \[ \[ it 's , \+ uh , it 's about , \] \+ it 's \] a real good book that a guy *ICH*-1 , uh , wrote *T*-3 who *T*-2 was , uh , a research librarian , E_S ###he wrote , uh , sort of *-1 debunking many of \[ the , \+ uh , uh , MUMBLEx the \] stories about the , uh , Bermuda Triangle .

89948:43	###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###they were *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah .

89951:59	###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah . E_S 
89961:85	###On that same topic , have you ever read anything about , you know , the Amelia Earhart story , whatever *T*-1 happened with her ? E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh , no , E_S ###I have not *?* .

90024:11	###SpeakerB58 . ###he was \[ an , \+ an \] assistant district attorney in Chicago \[ \[ at , \+ uh , and \] \+ while \] he was writing the book , E_S ###and , uh , my sister-in-law lives in Chicago , E_S ###and \[ she had , \+ before it actually got big , she sent \] me this book *-1 saying , you might like this , E_S ###this guy is , you know , from here .

90050:11	###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah E_S ###I , N_S ###that was really , really good , E_S ###the movie was nothing compared to the book . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah , E_S 
90059:33	###Yeah , E_S ###that is what I have heard *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###And . N_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###I saw the movie , E_S ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Oh , the movie was a joke compared to , N_S 
90074:87	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###\[ and , \+ and so , \] \[ it was , \+ it was \] a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast *T*-1 off in the movie .

90351:118	###I know recently I was in a discussion E_S ###and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools , E_S ###SpeakerA92 . ###Right .

90360:18	###You know , you ca n't say , um , you know , ###I know 0 Steven probably would not be accepted *-1 because he has a learning disability \[ and , \+ \] into a private school . \[ And , \+ \] um , \[ which *T*-3 is , \+ which *T*-2 is \] too bad .

91001:27	###so it 's got big name recognition in this area , ###a big science school , no football team , but a big science school , E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah .

91010:20	###you really have *-1 to think about that for the job . E_S ###I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor 's *T*-1 , E_S ###and when I , N_S ###now , I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs *T*-1 , E_S ###I was going *-1 to be a teacher , E_S ###I was just a high school teacher , E_S ###so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of , E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah .

94111:48	###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###But , uh , this one has been well organized E_S ###and in fact it used *-1 to be at Lake Brownwood , E_S ###and now it 's Lake Texoma , because that 's more central location 0 for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . 
94116:16	###and now it 's Lake Texoma , because that 's more central location 0 for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###I 'm sure 0 location 's really important as far as * figuring out where one ought *-2 to be *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Very important , because , uh , you 'll start *-1 losing people if it 's too far * to go . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
94158:5	###and everyone brings in food E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant , E_S ###and uh it really , uh , has worked out . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . 
94177:10	###well , I guess , um , 0 ours probably is n't that big . E_S ###Our family is dwindling , for one thing . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###And I often feel funny because I 'm in a branch that *T*-1 's all but died E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###I just have one aunt and my family . E_S 
94236:35	###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###that 's true . E_S ###Well , that 's neat . E_S ###I \[ think , \+ think \] 0 they 're really fun . E_S ###We go to mine regularly , E_S ###and then we go to my husband 's *ICH*-1 occasionally down in Temple , E_S ###and he has a large family , E_S 
94260:23	###SpeakerA75 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###and it *EXP*-1 's just too much for all of them , all of that group to travel . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###It *EXP*-1 's an , all day drive * just to get to this area . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###SpeakerA79 . ###SpeakerB80 . ###Right . E_S 
94279:12	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we have , N_S ###each year , of course , they elect officers of the family reunion E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###and a number of years ago , back in the early eighties , my wife was president . E_S 
94399:4	###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB140 . ###Well , thanks a lot ###I enjoyed *-1 talking to you . E_S ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###Been nice * talking to you . E_S ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S 
94407:107	###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###what do you think 0 *T*-1 is the biggest problem ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###The biggest problem , well , like in this part of town seems *-1 to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that , uh , you know , you can throw money at it , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###but it 's , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S 
94435:93	###SpeakerA11 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] think that the biggest problem is , uh , \[ with the , \+ uh , with the \] home environment being part of it . E_S ###You know , if , N_S ###I think 0 too many parents expect , uh , the school to teach , uh , the moral aspects \[ of , \+ of \] things \[ to the st- , \+ to the kids \] \[ and , \+ \] you know , while we 're not going *-1 to worry about , uh , *-2 teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that , you know , and then expect them to pick it up at school , E_S ###you 're not going *-1 to do that , you know , E_S 
94453:66	###and I think 0 \[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's , \] \+ that 's \] another root problem . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###you know , I wonder if that 's a root problem or not , E_S ###because I think about that a lot , E_S ###and it 's just like , everybody likes *-1 to blame everything on drugs now , E_S ###but I wonder , you know , E_S ###do you get the , N_S ###oh , that 's kind of side tracked , E_S 
94458:15	###because I think about that a lot , E_S ###and it 's just like , everybody likes *-1 to blame everything on drugs now , E_S ###but I wonder , you know , E_S ###do you get the , N_S ###oh , that 's kind of side tracked , E_S ###but , uh , I just remember *-1 seeing on the news the other night , 0 they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###I thought , well , you know , of course they 're doing better , 
94471:26	###SpeakerA19 . ###Right , E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###And I wonder if , not so much that , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Well , I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ like you say , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \] the socioeconomic mix E_S ###\[ \[ there , \+ you know , the , \] \+ they 're , \] N_S 
94486:44	###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah , E_S ###this is interesting because in my mind I do n't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment , E_S ###but , uh , \[ this , \+ this \] was actually inner city E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###people were sending , N_S ###I mean , just because their kids had the ability \[ and the , \+ and the \] drive *-1 to \[ do , \+ try \] and get an education , they did n't send him to a public school , you know , E_S 
94501:25	###and that may be passed *-1 on down to the kid as well , E_S ###and , uh , maybe they pick up on that . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###And then from the other aspect , um , maybe the , uh , school itself \[ \[ has , \+ has , \] \+ has \] more emphasis on , uh , *-1 trying *-2 to do a good job because the classes may be smaller , uh , E_S ###they may be able *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] give the resources that *T*-2 's needed *-3 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] do a good job . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I mean , N_S 
94503:23	###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###And then from the other aspect , um , maybe the , uh , school itself \[ \[ has , \+ has , \] \+ has \] more emphasis on , uh , *-1 trying *-2 to do a good job because the classes may be smaller , uh , E_S ###they may be able *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] give the resources that *T*-2 's needed *-3 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] do a good job . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I mean , N_S ###and \[ what do you , \+ what would you do *T*-1 \] *-2 to fix the school systems ? E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
94519:11	###and I think 0 this is happening some around the country in terms of , um , morals , * trying *-1 to teach the kinds of things \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 are n't getting taught *-3 at home , \[ \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] \+ and \] respect for other people . E_S ###Uh , I think 0 that 's a big part of it . E_S ###You know , people , you know , N_S ###if you do n't care about property and people , you know , you 're not going *-1 to care \[ about , \+ uh , about \] learning , I think . You know , E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###you 're not going *-1 to really care about yourself . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S 
94528:22	###Yeah . E_S ###That 's what I was going *-1 to say *T*-2 . E_S ###It 's the chicken and the egg thing .

95379:34	###SpeakerA58 . ###that way you ca n't feel like somebody 's out *-1 to get me . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###If , N_S ###it 's almost like * being selected *-1 for jury duty . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA62 .

95419:17	###SpeakerB77 . ###SpeakerA78 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###\[ I 'd just \+ I 'd \] feel really uncomfortable . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###SpeakerA82 . ###Right . E_S

95423:43	###\[ I 'd just \+ I 'd \] feel really uncomfortable . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###SpeakerA82 . ###Right .

95440:205	###but out on the line , they 've got people working some serious equipment . E_S ###SpeakerA86 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###SpeakerA88 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerA90 . ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's , \] N_S 
95455:54	###I agree totally .

95460:28	###SpeakerB97 . ###And in the long run , we 're all paying for that E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###Right .

E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] was trying *-1 to remember , 
95476:78	###and the city workers , uh , took them to court *-1 to protest , *-1 saying that it invaded \[ their , \+ I guess , \[ first a- , \+ \] \[ the , \+ the \] \] search and seizure amendment E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh .

95478:14	###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###and it 's still tied *-1 up in the legal channels . E_S ###They have n't ruled on whether they can test them or not .

E_S ###SpeakerB107 . ###So I 'm curious especially since T I -s a local , you know , employer is also already doing it , * seeing what they 'll say *T*-1 about it especially since , N_S ###SpeakerA108 . 
95491:66	###\[ Is it , \+ is it , \] uh , just a small group of the employees that *T*-1 are concerned ?

95503:59	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA116 . ###Uh , my husband 's retired from I R S agents . E_S ###SpeakerB117 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA118 . ###However , this is n't a problem that we have *T*-1 either alcohol or drug , E_S ###SpeakerB119 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA120 . 
95511:16	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA120 . ###and so , \[ \[ we , \+ we , \] \+ in our minds we 're \] thinking what 's the big deal *T*-1 .

E_S ###If I had something 0 * to hide *T*-1 , it 's one thing , E_S ###but I 'm , N_S ###you know , you know 0 you do n't , N_S ###so it 's not as big a deal , E_S 
95522:82	###SpeakerA122 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB123 . ###SpeakerA124 . ###\[ And , \+ and then \] they say , well , if you give them the right * to do this , then they 're going *-1 to take some other right away from you , E_S ###but \[ I , \+ I \] firm- , N_S ###SpeakerB125 . ###I do n't believe that . E_S ###SpeakerA126 . ###I think that an employer has the right * to ask you *-1 to do anything , E_S 
95530:11	###SpeakerA126 . ###I think that an employer has the right * to ask you *-1 to do anything , E_S ###and , of course , \[ the big deal , \+ one of the big deals \] now , too , is \[ to , \+ \] that when you , come into a company *T*-2 , \[ as \+ \] you sign a paper saying that I will go *-1 take a , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , uh , E_S ###well do you , uh , keep a family budget E_S ###or do you have some , N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###No , E_S ###I do n't use a family budget , E_S

97108:21	###And she said I am not doing it anymore . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] just , N_S ###SpeakerB204 . ###You know I think 0 that 's one of the things that we have *T*-1 today that *T*-2 is very useful , E_S ###and I think 0 every woman ought *-1 to deal with it or , ought *-1 to at least be exposed *-2 to it , E_S ###and that is mediation training . E_S ###SpeakerA205 . ###Um , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB206 . ###Uh , we are not talking about strikes or things E_S 
97122:7	###SpeakerA209 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB210 . ###SpeakerA211 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB212 . ###because , the mediator is an unbiased bystander who , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S

97150:4	###SpeakerB8 . ###but you have friends that *T*-1 have children . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###I have some friends that *T*-1 have children , ###uh , not that many actually . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
97151:4	###but you have friends that *T*-1 have children . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###I have some friends that *T*-1 have children , ###uh , not that many actually . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###What is child care like *T*-1 in New York ? E_S 
97208:33	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###It is a little , N_S ###I miss the intellectual stimulation . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Right .

97235:39	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###I would not want her to be \[ into a , \+ in a \] large day care situation *-2 so young .

E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Maybe if I needed *-1 to work part time , like four hours a day , I might do that , cause like , you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . 
97262:14	###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###Well , such as things for learning gives the child stimulation 0 I think 0 *T*-1 is important . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###And , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
97269:29	###SpeakerA61 . ###And , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Our oldest grandson , when he was eighteen months old *T*-1 went into \[ a , \+ a \] Montessori , day care system .

E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And they took infants starting at six weeks , E_S ###and they have a program , uh , \[ in , \+ \] that *T*-1 was devised *-2 by this montessori person E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , and \] a certain type of stimulations N_S 
97288:55	###and some were just different objects that *T*-1 \[ have , \+ had \] a definite purpose for kids , you know , E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###and there 's something about their eyes . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA71 . 
97290:4	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###and there 's something about their eyes . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###well \[ she 's , \+ she 's \] just been doing all kinds of stuff where she 's , you know MUMBLEx , N_S ###SpeakerB72 . 
97309:73	###SpeakerA77 . ###And she 's just started that like yesterday or the day before , E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###\[ and \+ so \] every days are different . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . 
97320:24	###and I will probably be going back to work around January , whereas she will be about , eight or nine months old . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###SpeakerB84 . ###A little older .

97325:55	###A little older .

E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###so you might have a real problem with that . E_S 
97332:39	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###so you might have a real problem with that . E_S ###I think 0 \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 \] hurts the parents * to leave when the child is crying *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###\[ But , \+ but \] I think 0 it , N_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###so \[ it , \+ you know , it \] would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah . E_S 
97360:31	###SpeakerA99 . ###Not that she will remember them , E_S ###but she 's met them . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###That 's nice when , uh , N_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ my , \] \+ I \] have three grandchildren , E_S ###another one coming in September , E_S ###and I , N_S 
97379:120	###or you can set up your work program and your husband 's so that one of you is there all the time . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] wonderful for the child . E_S ###But , N_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Well , if I work part time that might be doable . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###Right . E_S 
97379:170	###or you can set up your work program and your husband 's so that one of you is there all the time . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah .

E_S 
97417:22	###And , you know , * maybe do some free lance type work at home . E_S ###And so , if I go back to work on a part time basis , I am hoping 0 I can leave my daughter with her .

E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . 
97422:10	###And , N_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###it will be a little rough when she is a very , very little infant *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . 
97427:82	###it will be a little rough when she is a very , very little infant *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###but like when she is a month or so *T*-1 , my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with baby-sitting for large families . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###And so , uh , she might be able *-1 to do it a couple of hours a day E_S 
97445:32	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###SpeakerB134 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###we might be able *-1 to exchange that way . E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA137 .

97460:75	###they hire a couple of people E_S ###and , uh , you know , parents come down *-1 to supervise or , whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB140 . ###Really well trained people . E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###SpeakerB142 . ###Right , E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB144 . 
97479:29	###SpeakerA149 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well she 's , N_S ###my daughter does not seem *-1 to be on a real schedule yet , E_S ###and it 's probably my fault , because I do not have a real schedule now . E_S ###SpeakerB150 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA151 . ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB152 . 
97495:18	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###SpeakerB156 . ###We- , you know 0 that works until they start school . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB158 . ###And that 's a problem , E_S ###society is geared to \[ a , \+ a \] day person E_S ###and it 's , N_S 
97508:43	###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###All right . E_S ###Well , I am , uh , the product of , uh , I think 0 *T*-2 as much *ICH*-1 the changing roles of women as anyone , E_S ###my mother , uh , N_S ###we come from a , N_S ###my mother and I were , uh , really , \[ prac- , \+ \] first generation divorce in our family . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
97536:5	###SpeakerA13 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###And , they all felt that \[ th- , \+ there \] was never an issue that my father \[ was the , \+ was the \] cause of the reason for the split up , even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh , mercy . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh , it was always my mother 's fault , ###she was not , uh , sufficient , you know , ###she just was not good enough . E_S 
97608:127	###Challenges . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Absolutely . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Challenges that *T*-1 have *-2 to do with my sex . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . 
97620:94	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###And , uh , the choir members treat me differently because I am a woman , ###they expect me to be more motherly , E_S ###they question my authority more , uh , than they ever would a man .

E_S ###SpeakerB50 . 
97674:34	###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###But there are a lot of die-hards *ICH*-2 out there that *T*-1 will never change . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###So we have *-1 to , uh , face that reality also . E_S ###SpeakerB76 .

97739:40	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###They , \[ in their , \+ in their \] own peer relationships , they do not treat themselves equal , E_S ###and so it *EXP*-1 's really difficult for them * to treat women as equals .

E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###Unfortunately there are often these correlations that *T*-1 are inverse of what they should be *T*-2 like , uh , wherever there are more , uh , criminals *T*-3 , there are more policemen E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . 
98277:43	###SpeakerA38 . ###but that 's which *T*-1 came first . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###But , on the other side of it is N_S ###\[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \+ basically \[ the , \+ the \] problem is \] \[ within the , \+ in the \] society and the society 's views E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Uh-huh .

98277:67	###SpeakerA38 . ###but that 's which *T*-1 came first . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Yeah .

98298:49	###SpeakerB49 . ###SpeakerA50 . ###SpeakerB51 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think , 0 I agree with you there . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Because it just was not , uh , something back in the sixties that uh , I even had *-1 to worry about *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA54 . 
98332:4	###SpeakerB61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###because it comes a bit from the angle that the , uh , uh , N_S ###it would certainly be an interesting test E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###but the other side of it , to me , N_S ###SpeakerB65 . 
98341:18	###SpeakerB65 . ###What *T*-1 happens if we lose worse . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###Uh , y- , N_S ###well , the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side , N_S ###and I think 0 if I look back fifty or a hundred years I 'd say 0 , you know , back then there were the opium dens E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###but the thing is , 0 if somebody ruined their life , uh , society did n't try *-1 to then save themselves from it , E_S 
98361:103	###SpeakerB73 . ###Yeah , E_S ###they have induced it themselves . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###and so , to me that 's , N_S 
98412:43	###That 's true . E_S ###We worked hard for everything . E_S ###That 's very true . E_S ###SpeakerA92 . ###And so they N_S ###SpeakerB93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA94 . ###in the , N_S ###there were the sixty-four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties , E_S 
98436:74	###and drunk driving is a good one , E_S ###* is that people are well indoctrinated *-1 in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable . E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###Right .

98448:29	###SpeakerB105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA106 . ###SpeakerB107 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ That , \+ I think that , \] uh , the drunk driving has \[ just \+ actually , just \] caught on .

98483:20	###and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it and broke all his windows and his lights and \[ his , \+ \] dented it everywhere , E_S ###SpeakerA120 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB121 . ###and they came and questioned us . E_S ###SpeakerA122 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB123 . ###You know , and , N_S ###SpeakerA124 . 
98503:20	###\[ that , \+ you know , it \] was an acceptable social behavior . E_S ###SpeakerB131 . ###Yeah , E_S ###very much so . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that , \+ those \] are some important points . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I , N_S ###\[ that 's , \+ those are , \] N_S ###SpeakerA132 . 
98513:125	###\[ What are , \+ what does \] your city have *T*-1 for gun control if anything ?

E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] guess because I work quite a bit with lawyers , I 'm not a lawyer , uh , that *T*-1 I find 0 a lot of things are so specialized that I 'm not sure , E_S 
98518:15	###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay .

E_S ###SpeakerA4 . 
98518:65	###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] guess because I work quite a bit with lawyers , I 'm not a lawyer , uh , that *T*-1 I find 0 a lot of things are so specialized that I 'm not sure , E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I \] look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense \[ of , \+ of \] the value of , and worth , so that they have real problems when it comes to , uh , uh *T*-1 , N_S ###they can find guilt or innocence E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Right .

98518:116	###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay .

98524:128	###they can find guilt or innocence E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###uh , but then when you quantify things *T*-3 and \[ that \+ \] might also hold criminal trials for how many years *T*-1 is appropriate , uh , that they might leave it to somebody else who , uh , *T*-2 has expertise in that . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Right , E_S ###I agree , too . E_S ###I do n't think 0 the jury should be the ones \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 put the \[ sense- , \+ sentencings \] down . E_S ###I think 0 the judges should *?* , E_S 
98534:108	###or even a panel \[ of , \+ of \] lawyers \[ if , \+ if \] it got to that point . Might be better \[ at \+ \] than just regular civil people .

E_S ###Because I find that , uh , N_S ###I 've been on a few juries E_S ###and , uh , as a say , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-1 to be around , uh , civil cases because I 've been an expert witness some , N_S ###and , uh , many matters are so complicated that it *EXP*-1 's so hard * to , uh , come up with the fair value , uh , or the fair sentence E_S 
98539:5	###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Uh , that , uh , N_S 
98545:9	###SpeakerB9 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Uh , that , uh , N_S ###when I only do something one , two or three times *T*-1 I 'm hardly an expert on it , E_S ###and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Yeah E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA12 . 
98551:93	###SpeakerB11 . ###Yeah E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###And so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was \[ a , \+ \] you know , worth five years or twenty-five *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Right , E_S ###that 's , N_S ###yeah . E_S ###\[ And , \+ and \] most people that *T*-1 do sit on juries , N_S 
98551:162	###SpeakerB11 . ###Yeah E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###And so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was \[ a , \+ \] you know , worth five years or twenty-five *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Right , E_S ###that 's , N_S ###yeah . E_S ###\[ And , \+ and \] most people that *T*-1 do sit on juries , N_S 
98560:28	###\[ And , \+ and \] most people that *T*-1 do sit on juries , N_S ###some people just sit on them once in their lifetime , you know , if they 're that lucky sometimes .

E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###SpeakerA16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###And \[ it , \+ they \] may have some different idea , E_S ###I mean , it *EXP*-4 might be more important for them * to put a \[ \[ sen- , \+ sen- , \] \+ sentencing \] *ICH*-5 *ICH*-2 down that *T*-1 was , uh , longer , you know , that \[ did n't fit , \+ the punishment did n't fit \] the crime *T*-3 .

E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###SpeakerA20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the judges do have \[ that , \+ that \] better knowledge of it . E_S 
98574:41	###SpeakerA20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the judges do have \[ that , \+ that \] better knowledge of it . E_S ###The only thing 0 I worry about *T*-1 sometimes is \[ if , \+ if \] you get somebody *ICH*-5 *ICH*-6 in there \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 has a name , that *T*-3 is the defendant and , you know , sometimes , might have more pull , which \[ *T*-4 that \+ \] does happen . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###I mean , we ca n't say 0 it does n't , because it does happen . E_S ###I mean not everybody \[ \[ is , \+ you know , has , \] \+ has \] the right morals sometimes . E_S 
98591:12	###Well , one of the others things that *T*-1 gets me \[ on , \+ on \] the juries is that often in the newspaper , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-3 to hear two things \[ that , \+ well , that \] *T*-2 go on . E_S ###One is , 0 you often see in the headlines the big numbers . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Uh-huh .

98671:43	###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###The , N_S ###because stories look very different when you hear different parts \[ of the , \+ of the \] truth *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###So that would kind of give you \[ a , \+ a \] clue , I guess 0 *T*-1 E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] sometimes you get the long term stuff E_S 
98832:40	###And you can see 0 in some of the departments in some of the schools , like history at Clark , they 're all pretty fancy .

E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . 
98848:53	###SpeakerB64 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###And so you try *-1 to maybe follow those if you know 0 you 're going there , E_S ###you do n't want *-1 to dress too tacky because you 're going *-2 to be in the same room with them . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , and you always , N_S 
98858:33	###course , it 's a standing joke , you know , \[ when the , \+ when the \] men come \[ in \+ in \] \[ a , \+ a \] tie and a suit coat *T*-1 , you say , you know , what , have you got a job interview today E_S ###or , \[ \[ \[ there , \+ there 's , \] \+ There 's usually , \] \+ yeah , there 's usually \] something going on \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , \[ and \+ \] *T*-1 \[ would , \+ would , \] uh , cause that to happen E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Or you 're going *-1 to be observed *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . 
98886:21	###SpeakerA79 . ###Whether , N_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###\[ They , \+ they \] dress pretty good , I would say 0 *T*-1 E_S ###and then they go to their coaching E_S ###and \[ they , \+ they \] put their shorts on there . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###* Change then . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###SpeakerA83 .

98929:44	###I think 0 we 're going the opposite direction .

98944:30	###Well , it *EXP*-2 's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run , I think , that you do n't have *-1 to be concerned about your wardrobe . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Uh-huh .

99425:22	###Yeah , E_S ###yeah .

99535:10	###and the weather got warm so quick E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###it just melted it all away . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I know . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . 
99545:55	###Course , when we get an ice storm *T*-1 , that 's not too much fun .

99958:28	###I , N_S ###my sister *ICH*-1 was here recently from Connecticut E_S ###and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans . E_S ###SpeakerB158 . ###Oh really ? .

E_S 
99980:74	###So they found \[ a , \+ a \] place nearby that they put her in *T*-1 last year . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###So it was pretty much a physical decision ?

99992:5	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###My husband 's family are reaching that point E_S ###but \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] so difficult . E_S ###Was she in favor of it E_S ###\[ or , \+ or \] was she kind of opposed to it ? E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Well , yeah , E_S 
100018:40	###bad , uh , nutrition on top of it . E_S ###And , uh , she got to the point 0 she did n't want *-1 to alone anymore .

100054:37	###* Did n't want *-1 to cook . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###And the portions , E_S ###people do n't want *-1 to try *-2 to figure out little bitty individual meals .

100166:22	###Well and it 's the first step \[ in , \+ in \] * actually accepting that you are failing \[ and , \+ and \] aging . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Uh .

100919:23	###It *EXP*-1 's not hard * to find anything that *T*-2 's part-time .

E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###SpeakerB35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . 
100929:7	###but , it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little *T*-1 E_S ###and this is one of the few churches that *T*-1 did it .

100966:21	###Yeah , E_S ###that is , uh , a big drawback I think 0 *T*-1 \[ in that , \+ in the , \] uh , public schools out here . You know , to , E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###you 're lucky *-1 to have an art teacher E_S ###and if you do you get them once a week or something , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA54 . ###Or pay for it after school . E_S ###Our Emily 's in the third grade over at Huffman E_S 
100986:11	###SpeakerB59 . ###Oh my goodness . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###SpeakerB61 . ###And with our budget cuts , I 'm sure 0 that 's \[ not going * to \+ not going *-1 to \] change anytime soon .

101008:4	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###It 's just , N_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###* Put the colors away . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###* Get the computers out E_S ###SpeakerA72 . 
101046:30	###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###Did you have a nanny E_S ###or did you have someone that *T*-1 lived in with you ? E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###SpeakerA84 . ###Well no , E_S ###she did n't live with us . E_S 
101112:34	###Oh that would be hard . E_S ###SpeakerB113 . ###You know , so , um , N_S ###SpeakerA114 . ###Well , they give a lot more leave .

101122:25	###We have more options *ICH*-2 now then we did when \[ I , \+ \] my kids were born *-1 *T*-3 , E_S ###with * being able *-1 to take off full-time longer \[ of , \+ \] you can phase your schedule in so that it 's not full-time for up to six months .

E_S ###\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] had a couple of assistants that *T*-1 came back just three days a week E_S

101164:50	###Right . E_S ###Right .

101182:50	###SpeakerA142 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB143 . ###So , it *EXP*-1 's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working E_S ###SpeakerA144 . ###Oh sure . E_S ###SpeakerB145 . ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA146 . ###You retain employees and keep them longer . E_S 
101204:135	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA154 . ###So , \[ I , \+ I \] hope 0 it helps . E_S ###It seems *-1 to help the new mothers not have *-2 to come back full-time .

E_S ###That 's our favorite . E_S 
102730:16	###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###And , my husband really likes their ribs . E_S ###So it 's hysterical . E_S ###We go in E_S ###and we sit there for an hour *-1 waiting *-2 to get in E_S ###and then we get there E_S ###and we do n't even look at the menu . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
102732:33	###SpeakerB38 . ###And , my husband really likes their ribs . E_S ###So it 's hysterical .

102740:23	###You know right away what you want *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###I know right away \[ what we , \+ what we \] want *T*-1 . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Well , we really enjoy prime rib , too , E_S ###and , uh , actually \[ the , \+ the \] Steak And Ale out here , uh , we 've gone to *T*-1 , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . 
102827:19	###SpeakerA75 . ###SpeakerB76 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###and , uh , the , N_S ###my husband and I like veal , uh a lot E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###and their veal dishes have been good . E_S 
102874:69	###SpeakerB92 . ###That was nice . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###It was *?* E_S ###and \[ we had the , \+ uh , we both enjoy \] mushroom soup E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###SpeakerA95 . ###and Linda had told me 0 they had the best mushroom soup E_S ###and they did . E_S ###It was wonderful E_S 
102884:16	###\[ but , \+ uh , and \] we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert , which *T*-1 was a chocolate sack .

102930:13	###SpeakerA117 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###and , uh , for dessert we thought 0 we had just stuffed ourselves . E_S ###And so \[ we had , \+ they had , \] uh , like a berry assortment . E_S ###\[ It was , \+ it was \] raspberries and blueberries \[ and , \+ and \] strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###And , you know , they did , like the raspberry puree , just kind of like \[ in a , \+ in a \] decoration on the , N_S 
102946:68	###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###and it was outstanding . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###It sounds wonderful . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###It was \[ really , \+ really \] relatively simple E_S ###but , oh , it was good . E_S ###It was really good . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . 
102982:6	###I guess 0 there 's so much competition that they , really have *-1 to be good . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###And , I thought 0 I would really miss that . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###I would *?* , too , E_S ###\[ because , \+ well , because \] we do n't go out very often . E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###SpeakerA137 . 
103001:12	###SpeakerA141 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB142 . ###Because the ones that *T*-1 are n't so good \[ do n't , \+ just do n't \] make it . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###Um , that reminded me of a place for lunch that *T*-1 's a little off the beaten track E_S ###but it is wonderful . E_S ###It 's called *-1 Cafe Max E_S ###and it 's at Plano Road and Campbell . E_S ###They have the most wonderful salads . E_S 
103001:34	###SpeakerA141 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB142 . ###Because the ones that *T*-1 are n't so good \[ do n't , \+ just do n't \] make it .

103015:4	###Okay . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Where do you live *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###In Plano . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###In Plano ? E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yes . E_S 
103048:18	###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Well , I think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be terrible * to live in an area like that E_S ###and , unfortunately , I think 0 there are a lot of areas that *T*-1 are , \[ that , \+ that \] bad . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
103048:42	###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
103074:65	###and now they 're doing that E_S ###and I guess 0 it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country , that 's the only pollution that *T*-1 's been there . E_S ###It 's not an area that *T*-1 is industry E_S ###but they were losing a lot of , uh , trees and a lot of , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###From acid rain ? E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Um , I guess . ###\[ From , \+ from \] something that the car \[ was , \+ uh , was \] giving *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
103081:17	###Um , I guess . ###\[ From , \+ from \] something that the car \[ was , \+ uh , was \] giving *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###I think 0 \[ it gives off , \+ uh , in the emissions , it gives off \] gases which *T*-1 combine up in the atmosphere , uh , and form \[ a , \+ a \] weak acid .

E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 .

E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###What *T*-1 's interesting , several years ago , I took a course , uh , on , uh , 
103093:41	###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###What *T*-1 's interesting , several years ago , I took a course , uh , on , uh , ###well , N_S \[ it was actually , \+ it was \] put *-2 on by the power companies \[ and , \+ \] about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was *T*-1 , E_S and there was n't *T*-1 from various kinds \[ of , \+ of \] energy . N_S ###And , uh , at that point in time , one person that *T*-1 was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain E_S ###and it was kind of pooh-poohed *-1 , you know . E_S ###Oh , you 're making a mountain out of a molehill , kind of thing . E_S 
103093:110	###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah .

E_S 
103096:49	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###What *T*-1 's interesting , several years ago , I took a course , uh , on , uh , ###well , N_S \[ it was actually , \+ it was \] put *-2 on by the power companies \[ and , \+ \] about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was *T*-1 , E_S and there was n't *T*-1 from various kinds \[ of , \+ of \] energy .

E_S ###So , it 's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when I took that course *T*-1 . E_S ###Now , a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear . E_S 
103110:110	###Many more deaths *ICH*-2 have occurred in *RNR*-1 and * dealing with *RNR*-1 coal plants then ever around nuclear plants . E_S ###It 's kind of funny because people are just petrified , at least some are *?* , at the thought of nuclear . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###So , I do n't know . E_S ###In Europe there 's a lot of dependency on nuclear power E_S ###and they recycle the fuel E_S ###and then instead \[ of , \+ of , \] N_S ###some people are really afraid * to recycle the fuel because they 're afraid 0 it could become , uh , bomb quality . E_S 
103111:20	###It 's kind of funny because people are just petrified , at least some are *?* , at the thought of nuclear . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###So , I do n't know .

E_S ###But , that 's the only sensible thing 0 * to do *T*-2 , is * recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground . As far as I 'm concerned , where it could eventually , perhaps , there 's some problem , uh , pollute the groundwater *T*-1 . E_S 
103129:23	###\[ I , \+ I \] get that sometimes , um , E_S ###my line gets some static . E_S ###I do n't know why . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###But , uh , solar , of course , would be \[ the clean , \+ the cleanest . \] E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Well , I know 0 it 's MUMBLEx , um , N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . 
103134:21	###But , uh , solar , of course , would be \[ the clean , \+ the cleanest . \] E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Well , I know 0 it 's MUMBLEx , um , N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston *T*-1 E_S ###and , uh , oddly enough I thought 0 our part of the country was ideal . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###I ca n't hear you at all for all this static . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . 
103146:61	###It must just , be on the line . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Can you hear me ? E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Now I can *?* again . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 .

103178:16	###\[ It , \+ it 's \] still got a long way 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Well I , N_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###It 's just , you know , a possible solution in the future , I think 0 *T*-1 , * maybe to help in some ways . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###It may not *?* in all ways . E_S ###Maybe they 'll come up with fusion . You know , \[ con- , \+ be able *-1 to control \] it . E_S 
103191:13	###SpeakerA61 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###It 's just 0 we ca n't control it . E_S ###Right now it *EXP*-1 takes more energy *ICH*-2 * to cause fusion to occur then you get *?* out , E_S ###so , it is n't *?* , ###not at all , N_S ###and you ca n't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field , E_S ###so that 's not going *-1 to work . ###At least not now . E_S 
103191:24	###SpeakerA61 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###It 's just 0 we ca n't control it .

E_S 
103222:35	###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . ###I 've noticed \[ 0 students \[ are , \+ are \] much more , \+ you know , \[ young , \+ young \] people are much more \] receptive to ideas about the environment and * protecting the earth .

103233:9	###You know , E_S it 's whatever , you know , N_S ###recycle , ###well , if it 's a problem , * forget that . E_S ###Uh , not throw the trash out the car window E_S and leave it in the car and then throw it away ? E_S ###How horrible , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###SpeakerB76 . ###Now , I 've always done those kinds of things because I just did n't like messes , E_S ###and ... N_S ###SpeakerB1 . 
103268:10	###SpeakerB11 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###and , uh , another reason , N_S ###\[ one of the arguments , that \[ really , \+ I really \] actually have been kind of ambivalent about *T*-1 it , \+ but one of the arguments that *T*-5 really , uh , made me feel kind of strongly against it , \] is that , uh , you know , someone said to me once , well , * imagine if the person 0 you love *T*-2 most in the world , like your mother or something , if someone killed her , ###would n't you want *-1 to see them killed *-2 for the punishment ? E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###SpeakerA14 . ###But then I thought about it E_S ###and I thought , well , the loss that I would feel *T*-1 at *-2 losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person 
103283:17	###SpeakerB17 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###SpeakerB19 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###How about you ? E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Well , \[ I guess , \+ you know , \[ I , \+ I \] guess \] 0 I can see it from several different perspectives , E_S

103334:49	###SpeakerA38 . ###but I just am scared of capital punishment , I guess 0 *T*-1 .

104072:16	###I wonder where they dump that *T*-1 .

104472:59	###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###They do n't do that .

104508:4	###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh , it *EXP*-1 was just easier *ICH*-2 * to do that than * to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat .

104512:29	###SpeakerA41 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah .

105020:4	###and , uh , the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing E_S ###and as soon as the front came over , it was calm . ###So you 're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle E_S ###and you paddle your way back in and hope 0 it does n't start *-1 raining on you right away . E_S ###And that did n't always work . E_S ###We oftentimes got wet , . E_S ###But , uh , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a \[ nice , \+ nice \] hobby 0 * to have *T*-1 .

105024:47	###And that did n't always work . E_S ###We oftentimes got wet , . E_S ###But , uh , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a \[ nice , \+ nice \] hobby 0 * to have *T*-1 .

E_S ###What are your memories of boating *T*-1 , E_S ###or current , N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , about the only memories that I have *T*-1 of boating , uh , N_S 
105042:18	###and if you did n't obey them , uh you know , there were a lot of accidents , I guess . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###But , uh , I found 0 the motor boating was real fun . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah , E_S 
105054:19	###and the lake that we learned on *T*-1 was the smaller of the two that we had access to *T*-2 E_S ###and it was maybe fifteen , twenty acres E_S ###and \[ it was , \+ uh , it had \] a lot of , uh , turtles in it . E_S ###And I got all ready *-1 to go E_S ###and I was down in the water \[ and , \+ and \] set *-1 to go E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , and \] just as that boat took off , a turtle bit me in the middle of the back . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###It did n't hurt too much , E_S 
105059:19	###\[ and , \+ uh , and \] just as that boat took off , a turtle bit me in the middle of the back . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###It did n't hurt too much , E_S ###but it bit enough to where I let *-1 go *T*-2 . E_S ###And the boat went off without me E_S ###and I reached back there and \[ s- , \+ \] pushed him away and got out of the water \[ a , \+ a \] while E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , it did n't even leave a mark . E_S ###It was just a little nibble E_S 
105067:66	###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , it did n't even leave a mark . E_S ###It was just a little nibble E_S ###and so I told everybody what *T*-1 happened E_S ###and they go , oh , yeah , sure , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###And so I get back down in there E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] I 'll be if he did n't do it again . E_S ###This time a little earlier ###\[ \[ and , \+ and \] \+ \] I had let * go before then and , before they took off this time \[ and , \+ and \] swatted him away . E_S

E_S ###* Did n't go very far , E_S ###but I got up . E_S ###And \[ it , \+ it \] was a \[ nice , \+ uh , nice \] long skiing career , E_S

105090:37	###I have n't \[ cr- , \+ managed \] *-1 to get a hold on that , uh , craft yet , E_S ###but , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###That sounds like a real challenge .

105100:4	###You need somebody 0 *T*-1 to kind of tell you what * to do *T*-2 , E_S ###but , just from what I 've seen *T*-1 , you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick , you know .

E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Well , my son , N_S ###SpeakerA1 .

105249:5	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###And I like *-1 to sight see E_S ###and I love *-1 to shop . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###So it 's , N_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###So that 's perfect . E_S 
105288:10	###SpeakerA69 . ###And I said now that we have all the miles , E_S we better start *-1 using them . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###It really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###So we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip . E_S 
105307:16	###Our , N_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###I think 0 that 's a good trip . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###And really , for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . 
105308:53	###SpeakerA77 . ###I think 0 that 's a good trip . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###And really , for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Now we did , what we sometimes do *T*-1 since we are in Ohio E_S 
105329:4	###SpeakerA85 . ###And \[ it was \+ oh , it was \] just great . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Oh , there 's too much 0 * to see *T*-1 really . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###SpeakerB88 . ###SpeakerA89 . ###Oh , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] the way 0 * to , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###All right , E_S 
105329:32	###SpeakerA85 . ###And \[ it was \+ oh , it was \] just great . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Oh , there 's too much 0 * to see *T*-1 really . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###SpeakerB88 . ###SpeakerA89 . ###Oh , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] the way 0 * to , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###All right , E_S 
105343:14	###but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra . Or something like that , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###something 0 my husband , N_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###And , of course , it has *-1 to have air-conditioning . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Oh , absolutely , E_S ###air-conditioning and a radio , uh , A M , F M and a cassette player E_S 
105355:12	###Does it have *-1 to be a special color ? . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh , I would think 0 kind of a subdued color would be nice . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###You know , \[ a , \+ a \] navy blue or a , N_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###It sounds like something 0 your husband would drive *T*-1 , right ? . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah , E_S 
105359:7	###SpeakerB10 . ###You know , \[ a , \+ a \] navy blue or a , N_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###It sounds like something 0 your husband would drive *T*-1 , right ? . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's what it would be for *T*-1 is for him to drive back and forth to work . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yes . E_S ###Well , I do n't think 0 we 're looking for another car right now because we just bought one , E_S 
105371:22	###and that was kind of iffy , E_S ###but that made it better economically , E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###I think 0 that 's something 0 we might want *T*-1 , too , is some kind of standard transmission *ICH*-2 at least rather than automatic . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###We 'll probably have *-1 to look for another second car sometime E_S 
105454:10	###and I think 0 just the idea \[ that \+ you know that \] you may be tested *-1 might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you 're , N_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###I do n't know that their job would be at risk , E_S ###because I think 0 they may put them into some sort of a program 0 *T*-1 to get them off of drugs . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###I would think that , N_S 
105494:76	###Oh , and , of course they can also cause injury to other people . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###\[ If they 're , \+ if they 're \] not , uh , you know , fully functional mentally while they 're doing their job .

105540:19	###But , you know , I think 0 they can test all 0 they want *?* for drugs you know , E_S ###and if they need *-1 to do that as a condition for employment N_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###and I know 0 many of them are doing it . E_S ###I know 0 my son has had *-1 to do it for both Sam 's and Wal-Mart E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . 
105552:54	###SpeakerA57 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###and , uh , , I do n't know , E_S 
105558:17	###SpeakerA61 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###and , uh , , I do n't know , E_S ###it 's just a problem that \[ p- , \+ \] no one is sure just how * to handle *T*-2 *T*-1 I think 0 *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###You know , I think 0 personally I 'm for it . E_S 
105558:57	###SpeakerA61 . ###That 's right .

105619:43	###SpeakerB88 . ###he took one \[ for , \+ for , \] uh , Wal-Mart for job hiring E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###and then Sam 's called him E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] he took another one E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . 
105628:8	###SpeakerB92 . ###and \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't know why they both made him do that *T*-1 since it was so close together . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###I can see 0 if , N_S ###because , you know , if it 's a thousand dollars , that 's a thousand dollars 0 they wasted *T*-1 .

106008:20	###Well , now there 's a good place *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 in Addison too called * Blue Mesa Grill that *T*-1 's on Belt Line that *T*-2 's close to Houston 's , as a matter of fact . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###All right . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###And , um , it 's great , E_S ###I mean , \[ their , \+ they have , \] ###I think , N_S 
106039:37	###I guess 0 our time 's about up , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Well , they have n't beeped us , have they *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Uh , well , they do n't always . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh , I thought 0 sometimes they say , you know this is three minutes or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S 
106047:21	###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I \+ they 've \] been *-2 doing that when , uh , the circuits are busy *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###SpeakerA83 . ###SpeakerB84 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###and other than that , they , you know , leave you go about five minutes , E_S ###and then , \[ that , \+ that 's \] about it . E_S 
106065:4	###SpeakerA89 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###SpeakerA91 . ###You bet , N_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
106069:35	###You bet , N_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###How would you feel *T*-1 about * sending an elderly family member to a nursing home ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I do n't feel very good about it , E_S ###but I think that at some times it can be the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S 
106081:7	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###He actually died a few months after that , E_S ###and so as , N_S ###at least in retrospect , it was the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S ###because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . 
106081:31	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###He actually died a few months after that , E_S ###and so as , N_S ###at least in retrospect , it was the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S ###because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . 
106081:42	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###He actually died a few months after that , E_S ###and so as , N_S ###at least in retrospect , it was the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S ###because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . 
106084:49	###and so as , N_S ###at least in retrospect , it was the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S ###because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . ###And what type of recommendations did you have *T*-1 when you decided where * to place him *T*-2 *T*-3 ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Um , well , the , see , uh , well , N_S 
106094:29	###\[ we , \+ he \] wanted *-1 to get into a Mennonite nursing home which *T*-2 is very popular and hard 0 * to get into *T*-3 and had like a ten year waiting list E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Oh , my . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###right , E_S ###we wound up just *-3 choosing \[ a , \+ another \] Mennonite nursing home that *T*-1 was easier 0 * to get into *T*-2 . E_S ###\[ Or \+ but \] naturally , N_S ###no , E_S ###it was even Mennonite related , E_S ###I 'm sorry , it was actually not a particularly great nursing home . E_S 
106104:9	###Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it *T*-1 , because he suddenly got sick and needed *-2 to be put *-3 in . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###SpeakerA13 . ###so the convenience , N_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . 
106117:47	###and we made the decision * to put her in a nursing home . E_S ###She has leukemia E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###and \[ her , \+ the rest of her \] family and her regular doctors and everybody 0 she trusted *T*-1 and knew *T*-1 was in Dayton , and were several thousand miles away E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###so I made the decision * to put her in a nursing home , E_S 
106143:28	###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###so she did n't have * to be transported *-1 back and forth . E_S ###So , she 's been there since August the thirteenth and seems *-1 to have adjusted pretty well . E_S ###It 's not her favorite place 0 * to be in *T*-1 . E_S ###She 'd much rather be here with me . E_S ###But when it got to the point 0 I was spending more time at the hospital with her *T*-2 *T*-1 , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
106159:57	###SpeakerB34 . ###Right , E_S ###and that becomes difficult then . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###So . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###She was falling down and hemorrhaging E_S ###and , you know , all kinds of physical problems , E_S ###so it just became too much 0 for me to handle *T*-1 , E_S 
106188:23	###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###and this , N_S ###eventually things just went too far E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###and he allowed himself to be put *-1 into a nursing home . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yes , E_S 
106196:105	###SpeakerA51 . ###Yes , E_S ###well , I think 0 sometimes when people get *-1 to be a certain age *T*-2 , other people have *-3 to kind of help them make decisions . E_S ###It *EXP*-1 sure would n't have been Granny 's decision * to leave us and go back to a nursing home , E_S ###but she 's accepted it real well now E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Right E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###so . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . 
106202:28	###Right E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###so . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###well \[ that 's , \+ yeah , that 's \] right that the children have some responsibility *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 , too , to their parents and such , * to help * decide what *T*-2 's the right thing . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Well , we enjoyed *-1 having her here , E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###And . N_S ###SpeakerA57 . 
106204:7	###so . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###well \[ that 's , \+ yeah , that 's \] right that the children have some responsibility *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 , too , to their parents and such , * to help * decide what *T*-2 's the right thing . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Well , we enjoyed *-1 having her here , E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###And . N_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###but we feel 0 she 's much safer where she is *T*-1 now . E_S ###She still continues *-1 to fall , E_S 
106209:21	###SpeakerB56 . ###And . N_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###but we feel 0 she 's much safer where she is *T*-1 now . E_S ###She still continues *-1 to fall , E_S ###but when she does *T*-1 \[ there , \+ \] a nurse is right there * to help her E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###and I know 0 she 's eating the right things , E_S 
106227:5	###SpeakerB2 . ###Yeah , E_S ###this is a great topic for me , because I just did my first two painting projects ever . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###* Was \[ not , \+ not \] a big deal E_S ###SpeakerA7 . 
106258:15	###Oh , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And the second one was 0 I bought some toys \[ at a , \+ um , at a \] craft fair . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###They 're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for Christmas , E_S ###and so I decided *-1 to paint them , E_S ###and that was n't as easy as * painting the apartment . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
106262:7	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###They 're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for Christmas , E_S ###and so I decided *-1 to paint them , E_S ###and that was n't as easy as * painting the apartment . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Oh , well , what kind of paint did you use *T*-1 for the , um , bookends ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Well , \[ \[ it 's , \+ uh , it , \] \+ that 's \] half the problem right there is that \[ it was n't , \+ it was \] a oil base , E_S ###so I had *-1 to get , N_S 
106297:30	###SpeakerB28 . ###yeah , E_S ###I had *-1 to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands * to go *-2 buy some paint thinner , \[ and MUMBLEx \+ and \] everything like that , E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Oh , . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###and then , um , downstairs in the apartment , \[ I just us- , \+ we just used \] a latex base , E_S ###and so you can drip it on , you know E_S ###if you dripped it on something , as long as you wiped it up , it was real easy 0 * to clean *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
106329:14	###SpeakerB38 . ###Have you painted anything recently . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Well , um , so * to speak , I had *-2 to paint \[ this , \+ uh , the \] inside of this warehouse thing that you keep some , um , farm equipment in *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Wow , was it huge ? E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . 
106434:9	###SpeakerB72 . ###Well , it was n't , N_S ###if it was my own I would have *?* , E_S ###but my friend said , oh * just go ahead , ###you just go ahead , ###it 's easy . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###SpeakerB74 . ###I said , Okay , it 's your place , E_S ###SpeakerA75 . 
106447:53	###we would go down two or three hours on the weekends , E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###So there was two of you all ? E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###No , E_S ###\[ there was , \+ they were \] doing all sorts of repairs , E_S 
106458:28	###SpeakerA81 . ###Well , that 's easy enough . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###So , there 's a whole bunch of people . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###So now I feel like if I ever buy a house , I can probably paint , if nothing else . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###I think 0 I could probably do it uh , 
106465:23	###So now I feel like if I ever buy a house , I can probably paint , if nothing else . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###I think 0 I could probably do it uh , ###as long as the hardware store told me what * to buy *T*-1 , then I could do it . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###SpeakerB88 . ###But you know , I went in to a hardware store *-1 to get paint for those toys , E_S ###and the guy said , Oh , * get this , 
106468:18	###as long as the hardware store told me what * to buy *T*-1 , then I could do it . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###SpeakerB88 . ###But you know , I went in to a hardware store *-1 to get paint for those toys , E_S ###and the guy said , Oh , * get this , ###it 's a nice shiny gloss , which *T*-1 was true , E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###SpeakerB90 . 
106474:25	###and the guy said , Oh , * get this , ###it 's a nice shiny gloss , which *T*-1 was true , E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###SpeakerB90 . ###but I did n't realize what , you know , pain it *EXP*-2 is *T*-1 * to clean the brushes and everything , if you do n't have latex E_S ###I do n't if N_S ###it 's worth the shine , E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
106481:12	###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Uh , \[ what i- , \+ what is \] your practice *T*-1 as far as budgeting ? E_S ###Do you manage the money ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , \[ I , \+ we \] talk about it , E_S ###but I 'm usually the one that *T*-1 sits down and puts the pencil to the paper \[ and , \+ and \] tries *-2 to somehow make the ends meet , which , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Oh , I see . E_S 
106491:54	###That 's how kind of I am *T*-1 , too . E_S ###Are you married ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Um , yes . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###You are *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###I think 0 the women for the most part end up *-1 managing the money . E_S 
106499:20	###SpeakerA7 . ###I think 0 the women for the most part end up *-1 managing the money . E_S ###My husband always says 0 he earns it , and I have *-1 to spend only what he earns *T*-2 . E_S ###It , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###I do n't mind the spending , E_S ###it 's just that * \[ trying * to , \+ trying *-3 to \] get what you need *T*-2 \[ out of , \+ out of \] what you have *T*-1 . E_S ###That seems *-1 to be our challenge . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Well , I do n't work outside of the home , E_S 
106499:40	###SpeakerA7 . ###I think 0 the women for the most part end up *-1 managing the money . E_S ###My husband always says 0 he earns it , and I have *-1 to spend only what he earns *T*-2 . E_S ###It , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###I do n't mind the spending , E_S ###it 's just that * \[ trying * to , \+ trying *-3 to \] get what you need *T*-2 \[ out of , \+ out of \] what you have *T*-1 . E_S ###That seems *-1 to be our challenge . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Well , I do n't work outside of the home , E_S 
106514:40	###SpeakerA13 . ###so \[ I , \+ I \] manage it . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Well , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] at home also , E_S ###so , it *EXP*-1 does get rather interesting * trying *-2 to survive on one salary , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Now , do you actually follow a budget ? E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Well , we pretty well do . E_S ###Um , several years we did n't , E_S 
106517:10	###Well , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] at home also , E_S ###so , it *EXP*-1 does get rather interesting * trying *-2 to survive on one salary , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Now , do you actually follow a budget ? E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Well , we pretty well do . E_S ###Um , several years we did n't , E_S ###and we found that we just were n't making the most of what we had *T*-1 , E_S ###and so \[ we , \+ we , \] um , set aside a certain amount *ICH*-1 each week that *T*-2 goes for things that *T*-3 have *-4 to be paid for *-5 , you know , E_S ###just our bills . E_S 
106549:35	###SpeakerA25 . ###uh , I do n't always succeed at that . E_S ###I usually keep one with a low interest rate , E_S ###and I put things *ICH*-1 on there that I think 0 I 'm not going *-2 to get to *T*-3 E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###and then I have another one , E_S ###but for the most part , our mortgage and our utilities at this point , ###we 're in a new home , 
106554:54	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###and then I have another one , E_S ###but for the most part , our mortgage and our utilities at this point , ###we 're in a new home , ###and , uh , they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used *-2 to *?* *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###so I 'm still getting used to that , E_S 
106572:60	###my husband , um , owned his own company E_S ###and it went under , E_S ###and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment , E_S ###and now it just seems just such a large amount of money 0 * to spend *T*-1 \[ that , \+ that \] we do have a used car , E_S ###well , he has a company car also , E_S ###but for our personal car we have a used car . E_S ###Um , do you think that it *EXP*-1 's wiser * to buy * used ? E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###We do for us ###very much so . E_S 
106600:22	###Oh , no , E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###the worst part is , 0 it 's the same color E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###and so everybody 's saying , you 're kidding , ###you have two cars the same , E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . 
106600:27	###Oh , no , E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###the worst part is , 0 it 's the same color E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###and so everybody 's saying , you 're kidding , ###you have two cars the same , E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . 
106622:45	###and we still know now that we have this car 0 * to put all the miles on *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###This is for all the long running back and forth on , you know interstate driving and things , E_S ###and we intend *-1 to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years , or next year probably .

106672:23	###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh , but that depends , you know , on the individual if they can I guess have self-control . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Well , that 's a lot of it . E_S ###Uh , I know 0 we tried several different ways . E_S ###One time we tried something that *T*-1 really worked E_S ###but we did n't keep it up . E_S ###I passed it on to a friend E_S ###and she wo n't quit *-1 doing it . E_S ###She loves it E_S 
106672:47	###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh , but that depends , you know , on the individual if they can I guess have self-control . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Well , that 's a lot of it .

E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###and you put the cash in envelopes marked * for that . E_S ###So you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera . E_S

112564:108	###SpeakerB68 . ###But , yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###In my area N_S ###because \[ w- , \+ I \] live in a college town in Penn State University E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###so I , N_S

113910:4	###SpeakerA34 . ###Because we have just , had a Naturalization Act where the Mexicans that *T*-1 were residents in Texas , I 'm from Texas \[ and \+ \] have become citizens now *T*-2 .

116828:70	###SpeakerB12 . ###and we subcontracted it out ourselves .

E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###and then we subbed it out , E_S 
116855:13	###SpeakerA25 . ###Well , that sounds interesting . E_S ###I bet 0 he 's enjoyed *-1 having it that way E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###He , N_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###because some- , N_S ###kind of hard * to find one prebuilt that *T*-1 \[ 's \+ kind of fits \] those specifications .

116860:106	###SpeakerA27 . ###because some- , N_S ###kind of hard * to find one prebuilt that *T*-1 \[ 's \+ kind of fits \] those specifications .

E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
116879:41	###SpeakerB36 . ###So we put a three car garage in . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###But , even if they had three car garages , they did n't have a work space . E_S ###All of it was taken *-1 up with just car space . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . 
116879:67	###SpeakerB36 . ###So we put a three car garage in . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###But , even if they had three car garages , they did n't have a work space .

116886:45	###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh .

116908:37	###SpeakerA49 . ###SpeakerB50 . ###Well , that 's nice that it 's not in your house . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###It really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh .

116926:22	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###So I did n't end up with my vacant room like I had thought 0 I would *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Well , we still have \[ a , \+ a \] son and daughter in college that *T*-1 come home . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###And the other room we use *T*-1 as a guest bedroom because my husband 's family come . E_S ###His parents come E_S 
116946:7	###all three of my daughters are married , E_S ###but , I do n't know , E_S ###I just still have need for the four bedrooms *-1 just having company from time to time . And some of them coming back home and things , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###SpeakerB68 . ###Oh , I understand . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###And we 've got grandchildren now , E_S 
116983:11	###so he could afford *-1 to get married *-2 but , is not engaged yet , E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###and my daughter 's been going with the same boy for a while , E_S ###but she 's still in college E_S ###and we 're just as happy for her to finish her education first . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . 
117019:42	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###But , they 're fun . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###So you 're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Well , I just watch them . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . 
117039:5	###So it 's worked pretty well . E_S ###There 's , N_S ###I do n't really think 0 anything 's been broken *-1 . E_S ###Every now and then we have *-1 to kind of go and say , now * do n't bother this , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###Um , uh-huh .

117070:14	###and they said 0 they thought 0 \[ a lot of it , \+ \] the reason 0 it was up so *T*-1 was because \[ of the , \+ \] uh , so many people are without work nowadays , E_S ###economy 's so bad . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Do you really believe that ? E_S ###I mean , \[ it , \+ it 's \] been up every year for many years E_S ###and the economy has n't been , this bad for so long , has it *?* ?

117146:5	###But , uh , we were , so , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###\[ So , \+ so \] you saw this happening in your neighborhood E_S ###and you figured 0 it would n't happen to you . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Sort of , yeah . E_S ###And I never did get a security system , E_S ###but since that happened , I certainly have *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah , E_S 
117206:4	###SpeakerB60 . ###\[ \[ S- , \+ s- , \] \+ so \] you got a sign up there that *T*-1 says 0 you got this alarm system . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh .

120477:8	###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] grew up in South Dakota , up in the Black Hills E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###and so we used *-1 to go *-2 camping , E_S ###my dad would take us , E_S ###\[ there was , \+ there was \] four of us kids , E_S ###\[ we 'd , \+ he 'd \] take us , E_S ###and we 'd all go *-1 camping , my dad and my mom \[ and , \+ and \] the kids , E_S ###and it was always fun , uh , E_S 
120478:80	###SpeakerB20 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###and so we used *-1 to go *-2 camping , E_S ###my dad would take us , E_S ###\[ there was , \+ there was \] four of us kids , E_S ###\[ we 'd , \+ he 'd \] take us , E_S ###and we 'd all go *-1 camping , my dad and my mom \[ and , \+ and \] the kids , E_S ###and it was always fun , uh , E_S ###because what I always remember *T*-1 is , my dad would let us pick our camp spot E_S 
120598:7	###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , really the ideal times 0 * to camp in this area *T*-1 are early spring , and , \[ in , \+ in \] the fall . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###It just gets so hot *ICH*-1 in the summer 0 you can hardly , N_S ###I mean , \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] a lot , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S 
120636:23	###SpeakerA13 . ###Is n't that the truth . E_S ###A flyer 's on every door every day . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Hey , I need the exercise , E_S ###so what the heck . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###That 's right . E_S ###Well , \[ \[ we , \+ um , we , \] \+ my husband \] does the same thing , E_S ###he does the yard , E_S 
120674:48	###I have n't gone out *-1 to check yet . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I do n't blame you . E_S ###I would n't want *-1 to look at them . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###No , E_S ###* listen , E_S ###but , um , the worst problem *ICH*-2 0 we 've had *T*-1 here with this grass was about the third year 0 we were here *T*-3 . E_S ###I guess 0 it was about four years ago . E_S 
120679:20	###SpeakerA25 . ###No , E_S ###* listen , E_S ###but , um , the worst problem *ICH*-2 0 we 've had *T*-1 here with this grass was about the third year 0 we were here *T*-3 . E_S ###I guess 0 it was about four years ago . E_S ###And we did not know in August *-1 to put down the , uh , whatever it is *T*-2 for grub worms . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###And the next spring , I guess 0 *T*-3 in that March , every time 0 we would go out and just try *-1 to walk on the grass or reach down *-2 to pull a weed *T*-4 , we 'd have big whole patches come up . E_S 
120693:36	###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by *-1 raking it , E_S ###it would just come off in the rake , down to the dirt . E_S ###So we had *-1 to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything . E_S ###It took a lot of money and a lot of time , E_S ###so the most careful thing 0 we do *T*-1 on our yard every August is * put down that Diazinon . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S 
120711:36	###we found them . E_S ###We dug under there about an inch E_S ###and you could see them . E_S ###They 're real fat little white things , E_S ###and they said 0 they turn into black bugs in the spring E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah , E_S 
120722:13	###SpeakerA39 . ###yeah , E_S ###\[ but in , \+ but in \] the , N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###and some people call them May beetles . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah , E_S 
120740:10	###but it was a preponderance of them that *T*-1 caused our problem . E_S ###So that 's the number one thing 0 we do *T*-1 , whether we fertilize or anything else , just because we got burned *-2 so badly before . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , I had some of that problem , E_S ###but mine was freeze . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Oh , yeah E_S ###that too , E_S ###two years ago , or last Christmas

E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . 
120921:19	###Yeah .

121012:10	###Right , E_S ###well , I mean , you could tell \[ just by , \+ just by \] how much money you have *T*-1 left *-2 over , E_S ###and all of a sudden , I do n't know , \[ it 's just , \+ it 's \] eating me *-1 alive .

E_S ###SpeakerB2 . 
121023:4	###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , uh , even though it 's totally out of \[ my , \+ uh , my \] degree training , I 've been working \[ as , \+ as , \] in the horticultural aspect , so the last , I do n't know , fifteen , twenty years , ###so Uh , I 'm , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh .

122003:21	###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###But I stopped *-1 doing that a long time ago , E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###and they still do it to me . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Even \[ it , \+ in \] the office I , uh , find that people walk up

122099:64	###SpeakerB88 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###And every time 0 \[ a , \+ a \] fire truck or anything went down the road *T*-1 , I would wake up , E_S ###but I guess 0 I have gotten used to it because I do n't even hear it anymore . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###I suppose 0 you do . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###And , uh , I just close it out , I guess 0 *T*-1 , 
122117:5	###I am a real solid sleeper though E_S ###so that probably would n't bother me . E_S ###I 'd sleep right through it .

122119:19	###I 'd sleep right through it . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###They would have *-1 to chop down the door and get you out , I guess 0 *T*-2 . . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Yeah . E_S ###It takes a lot . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###* Let 's see . ###What else is an invasion *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB98 . 
122158:21	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , uh , I am a student E_S ###and I have , uh , been actually watching more movies on video , than * being able *-1 to go out *-2 to see , uh , movies \[ at the store , \+ or at the theater . \] E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh .

122191:13	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh , the story was , N_S ###uh , though it tended *-1 to be a little one sided uh , it was good . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , \[ it was , \+ it was \] believable . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] just moved down *ICH*-1 , in fact , from South Dakota \[ in , \+ in \] June , E_S 
122195:38	###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , \[ it was , \+ it was \] believable . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] just moved down *ICH*-1 , in fact , from South Dakota \[ in , \+ in \] June , E_S ###and that 's when the movie was filmed *-1 *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
122196:31	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , \[ it was , \+ it was \] believable . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] just moved down *ICH*-1 , in fact , from South Dakota \[ in , \+ in \] June , E_S ###and that 's when the movie was filmed *-1 *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###and , uh , \[ we , \+ \[ when , \+ when \] the movie came out *T*-1 , we \] went , N_S 
122225:74	###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###or , you know , they 'd start *-1 recognizing people . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###SpeakerB32 . ###\[ They knew , \+ they knew \] the extras or the , N_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S 
122226:32	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###or , you know , they 'd start *-1 recognizing people . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###SpeakerB32 . ###\[ They knew , \+ they knew \] the extras or the , N_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###So , \[ I kind of , \+ I think \] 0 I enjoyed it more *ICH*-4 \[ when I , \+ when I \] watched it on video cassette *T*-1 than I did , uh , in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted *-2 every time 0 they 'd say that *T*-3 . E_S 
122327:62	###Oh , they had it everywhere , E_S ###uh , every major city had one theater that *T*-1 did it E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Okay . E_S ###Because we had one here in Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Right , E_S ###and they did it in Houston , E_S ###\[ they did it , \+ well , they did it \] everywhere . E_S 
122342:16	###but you can watch the characters develop , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Uh , well , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 it 's a subject 0 I have n't thought too much about *T*-1 . E_S ###Uh , I do n't know if there 's so much wrong with the public schools , uh , as much as , we 're expecting too much out of them . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###SpeakerA3 . ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , that might be a lot 0 *T*-1 to do with it . E_S ###I know 0 a lot of it here in my state , N_S ###I 'm from Mississippi , E_S 
122356:29	###Minnesota , E_S ###okay . E_S ###Well a lot of it in Mississippi here has got *-1 to do with funding . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Problems with our educational system , a lot of it 's due to money . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . 
122393:26	###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess that in , uh , N_S ###* talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 they 're expecting schools to discipline the kids E_S ###and , uh , I think 0 it should go right back to the parents . ###If you do n't train your kids right then . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###I feel the same way . E_S 
122398:10	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###I feel the same way . E_S ###A lot has *-1 to do with how the kids were raised *-2 *T*-3 at home . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
122399:31	###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###I feel the same way . E_S ###A lot has *-1 to do with how the kids were raised *-2 *T*-3 at home . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###And then when the kids get to school *T*-1 , they try *-2 to take away a lot of things that they can do *T*-3 *-4 to discipline the kids . E_S 
122403:30	###A lot has *-1 to do with how the kids were raised *-2 *T*-3 at home . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###And then when the kids get to school *T*-1 , they try *-2 to take away a lot of things that they can do *T*-3 *-4 to discipline the kids . E_S ###I mean , they 've so severely limited E_S what disciplinary action you can do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S 
122444:27	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###And , unfortunately , there 's not many places 0 * to get that money *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Then if you do n't have qualified teachers in the different MUMBLEx , N_S ###I know 0 one of my physics professors at college has addressed this .

E_S ###And they do n't know a lot about that . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
122460:85	###SpeakerB42 . ###Where maybe a physics professor , N_S ###\[ he , \+ my \] professor was a physics professor E_S ###and he said 0 a lot of teachers teaching physics today *ICH*-1 have no background of physics at the high school level . E_S ###So therefore , they 're teaching from a teacher 's point of view and not from a physicist point of view . E_S ###And that causes a lot of trouble . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###I do n't know , E_S 
122470:7	###\[ \[ e- , \+ e- , \] \+ maybe \] they should sit back \[ and , \+ and \] kind of , uh , decide on where the money 's best spent *-1 *T*-2 .

124233:96	###SpeakerA19 . ###So , that 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###There 's was Twins *ICH*-1 there , or , you know Skip Williams . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Or country . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S 
124241:4	###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah .

124248:5	###It sure was *?* , E_S ###it sure was *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###What do you think 0 *T*-1 going *-2 to happen to the Rangers ?

E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###I was sure hopeful anyway . E_S 
124264:7	###I did n't really have one in South Dakota . E_S ###So I adopted the Rangers , E_S ###or rather they adopted me , I guess 0 *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###and , uh , it was just exciting , you know , E_S ###you can watch baseball on T V E_S ###and they hit the long ball , E_S ###and it looks like wow , they really hit that ball . E_S 
124290:17	###in fact , on the news tonight , Nolan Ryan was on there .

E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
124314:6	###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###SpeakerB50 . ###You know , and he said , I get a kick out of it , you know , E_S ###\[ he 's , \+ he 's \] such a nice man .

124325:75	###SpeakerA53 . ###Management . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###SpeakerA55 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###But , \[ he 's , \+ uh , he \] certainly is a good example , uh , for the kids . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . 
124328:46	###SpeakerA55 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###But , \[ he 's , \+ uh , he \] certainly is a good example , uh , for the kids . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###That 's right .

E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###You know , some of the , N_S 
124332:70	###SpeakerA57 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###You know , you like *-1 to have someone like that 0 you could point to *T*-2 say , * see what a fine man , that , he is *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###You know , some of the , N_S ###like , uh , Ivan Rodriguez was n't even born *-1 \[ when , \+ when , \] uh , Nolan Ryan started *-2 pitching *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . 
124340:40	###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###And it *EXP*-1 's just incredible * to think that \[ there 's , \+ uh , there are \] players who *T*-2 are the sons of ball players that *T*-3 used *-4 to play against Nolan or with Nolan , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###and now their sons are *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Oh , he 's been a legend for so many years , you know , E_S ###and I do n't know , E_S 
124368:45	###yeah , E_S ###his son pitched for U T E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Well that is neat . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###and , uh , only , uh , Ryan did n't want too much publicity on it because he did n't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###A game is a game , you know . E_S 
124377:7	###A game is a game , you know . E_S ###Well , the Rangers really , uh , knocked the socks off of them , which you would expect *T*-1 you know , anyway , E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###but Nolan I think 0 *T*-2 took himself out after a couple of innings *ICH*-1 or something , you know , of the game E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . 
124387:102	###So what do you , uh , think 0 *T*-1 is \[ the , \+ uh , the \] worst culprit for air pollution ?

E_S ###Um , factories \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 burn coal as \[ a , \+ an \] energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants , you know , E_S ###and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Uh , those are the ones 0 I think 0 *T*-1 primarily contribute to acid rain , E_S ###and I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] probably hurting us a little bit . E_S 
124392:43	###SpeakerA4 . ###Uh-huh .

124418:29	###SpeakerB13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Huh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess 0 I missed that one . E_S ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###Automobiles of course are contributing , too , E_S 
124427:21	###Automobiles of course are contributing , too , E_S ###and , you know , \[ how , \+ how \] we are *T*-1 with our love affair with the auto E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###kind of hard * to do anything about that , I guess *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###I know , E_S ###uh , in the Twin Cities area , N_S ###I just moved out of there and was kind of happy 0 I timed it just right , E_S 
124436:29	###I just moved out of there and was kind of happy 0 I timed it just right , E_S ###but they had a new policy where in order * to get \[ your , \+ uh , your \] \[ license , \+ uh , your car license , \] uh , renewed *-1 , you had *-2 to meet the pollution standards *T*-3 E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###and , uh . N_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###We have that here , too , E_S ###but it 's part of the inspection sticker , you know , E_S ###they put a probe in your exhaust pipe E_S 
124445:16	###they put a probe in your exhaust pipe E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] the computer reads whatever the ionization *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 coming out , E_S ###and so \[ that 's , \+ you know , that 's \] the way 0 they 're dealing with it here *T*-1 .

124617:13	###But . N_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So what is your advice to * picking a college *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###My advice \[ is \+ is , \] uh , * look \[ for , \+ at \] the student to faculty ratio , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###if you 're going *-1 to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one *T*-3 , I do n't think 0 you 're going *-2 to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you 're down to the thirty to forty to one . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
124631:4	###Was there a , N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###it was about twenty-six to one . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Oh , that 's great . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
124634:5	###SpeakerB36 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Oh , that 's great . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Which *T*-1 is , you know , N_S ###\[ it , \+ it 's \] interesting , E_S ###but \[ it , \+ it 's \] N_S 
124643:97	###but \[ it , \+ it 's \] N_S ###what I thought 0 *T*-1 was nice is 0 \[ you could al- , \+ there was always \] time 0 * to talk to professor , you know *T*-2 , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] they knew you . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###You were n't just in their class , you know , E_S ###and so \[ you could , \+ you could \] go *-1 talk to them in their office almost at any time , E_S ###\[ and , \+ or \] if you ran into them in the student union or whatever , you know , you could sit down , talk to them about a problem .

E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
124720:30	###because \[ I , \+ I \] did n't , E_S ###and I took tons of classes that I did n't need *-2 to *?* *T*-1 , E_S ###and , um , I do n't know , E_S ###I just feel like \[ I 'm , \+ \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \] going *-1 to take me a lot longer than , N_S ###and not that 's always bad , E_S ###but it 's , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###it 's frustrating , I guess 0 *T*-1 .

130762:45	###SpeakerB41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###everybody does newspapers . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###But , \[ that , \+ that \] kind of stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Yeah .

130837:7	###Now they 're starting *-1 to recycle that stuff . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###Oh , that 's good .

E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I know 0 a lot of places , they , uh , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Okay , E_S ###I guess 0 we 're ready *-1 to start .

130921:19	###But , uh , I do n't know , E_S ###I 'm not sure 0 I would want *-1 to take on those winters . E_S ###I 'm getting older and , uh , not sure that 's something 0 I want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###I know . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . ###SpeakerB28 . ###I live , uh , over in the Lake Highlands area if you 're familiar with that . E_S ###SpeakerA29 .

130989:67	###so \[ I do n't \+ I do n't \] even know how high those go *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###but some of those are pretty big . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yes , E_S ###those are over a million . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah . E_S 
130998:12	###Yeah . E_S ###So , \[ it 's , \+ that 's \] the strange thing about , I guess , Dallas because back where I 'm from *T*-1 , you would n't have that sort of a variation at all .

133293:18	###Something is definitely wrong . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###But , um , N_S ###SpeakerB28 .

E_S ###They 're all so different . E_S ###That 's another thing about the United States . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###There 's no national curriculum , you know , E_S

E_S ###I just read about that the other day , E_S ###and I had never even thought of it . E_S ###Actually it makes sense to a certain extent , E_S 
133370:4	###But , uh . We actually rank *-1 forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes *?* , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Um .

133415:5	###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh , kinder- , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###You think about AIDS research ? E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Well , AIDS is a nasty , terrible disease , E_S ###and you die from it .

133449:4	###Uh , in the country , America . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Um , that 's , N_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###and they have millions . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . 
133471:4	###\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 they 're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Do you think 0 they should spend more ?

133741:56	###And just start at square one . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###That was an all day job , * just to get it plumbed *-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Well , and then if you do it wrong . N_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
133749:49	###Well , and then if you do it wrong .

133841:11	###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###We did , uh , oh , N_S ###you do mix the color as far as you start with , uh , white E_S and then they add the color . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . 
133854:4	###Yeah . E_S ###But you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###SpeakerA75 . ###Right . E_S ###And then I wall papered a couple of walls , E_S ###and , uh . N_S ###SpeakerB76 . 
133868:13	###SpeakerB78 . ###Kind of fun , is n't it *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###That 's an education in itself . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Really .

133913:28	###I started at one edge and went over , E_S ###then you had *-1 to cut around the closet and cut around a window E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###but , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB102 .

133948:5	###SpeakerB5 . ###Um , no , E_S ###I think 0 the media 's a little bit too manipulative .

E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###SpeakerB120 . ###Oh , gee . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###So , I do n't know . E_S

136472:68	###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them ?

E_S ###So , I 've just recently had *-1 to start *-2 looking at it myself . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah .

136497:4	###They 're just tar and gravel treated flat top roofs . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Have you got pretty well pitch on that roof , ###or is it pretty steep ?

136574:19	###uh , I think , with , uh N_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Wood framing ? E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###yeah , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###But , uh , somehow or other that does manage *-1 to , uh , show these little cracks . E_S 
136586:21	###I do n't really know . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###MUMBLEx they plastered over drywall . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 it is *?* .

137132:4	###SpeakerA7 . ###Most the time they have a pretty good guarantee , E_S ###yeah .

137156:41	###SpeakerA13 . ###MUMBLEx . ###SpeakerB14 . ###Well , my daughter is twenty-one now , E_S ###so it 's been a while since we 've had Barbie things .

137264:5	###And like \[ I 've even bought , \+ on a recliner once I bought , \] you know , \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ an \] extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that , E_S ###and I never used it .

137281:21	###SpeakerA61 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###So , I mean , N_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###I think 0 these extended warranties are gimmicks , really . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###I do too . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###A lot of it . E_S 
137318:22	###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , so \] we really have been fairly happy \[ wi- , \+ with \] things , E_S ###but now we take good care of things E_S ###and we do n't , uh , run out and buy a lot \[ of , \+ of \] things either .

138118:21	###So they do n't , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###That 's good .

138118:32	###So they do n't , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###That 's good .

E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###And I just did n't think 0 that was going *-1 get it . E_S 
138156:34	###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I know . E_S ###That 's a big problem . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###And , uh , * *EXP*-2 makes me a little nervous that , uh , students do n't seem *-1 to show that respect E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
138191:9	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###SpeakerA55 . ###For other people E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###SpeakerA57 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
138218:50	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###And I just do n't think that this does n't always get emphasized *-1 anymore , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###That just is n't coming through is it *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###SpeakerA71 . ###No . E_S 
138232:7	###* had *-1 to wear dresses , did n't you ?

138250:26	###SpeakerB80 . ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Yes , E_S ###so it 's really changed . E_S ###It 's , uh , really kind of gone the rounds , E_S ###so I think that maybe that 's effected it to some degree . E_S 
138261:31	###so I , N_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 that probably does \[ have , \+ have \] something 0 *T*-1 to do with it , E_S ###and it 's also , N_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###\[ Do , \+ uh , does \] this school 0 your son goes to *T*-1 , do they , uh , \[ re- , \+ require \] * to wear a uniform E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###No , E_S

138335:76	###Uh-huh .

138346:23	###so I designed a space just the right size for the T V and then \[ the , \+ the \] V C R and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###And , uh , that 's worked pretty well .

138371:7	###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###so \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] good . E_S ###That 's good . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . 
138379:33	###That 's good . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###But what I need *T*-1 next is a good table saw . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###And \[ I , \+ I \] debate whether it *EXP*-1 's better * to get \[ a , \+ uh , just a \] straight table saw or to get one of these , uh , rotary arm saws . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
138406:22	###Uh , but , uh , yeah , E_S ###a table saw does take \[ a lot of time , \+ * excuse me a lot of space \] and is a pretty big investment . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh , \[ that , \+ that 's \] partly my problem now . E_S ###I do n't have room for this . E_S ###\[ I , \+ uh , I , \] N_S 
138449:14	###and it 's a great \[ stress , \+ stress \] reliever . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Have you ever used a lathe ?

138459:4	###So , uh , what do you think *T*-1 about child care . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Oh , well , \[ my , \+ my \] feelings on it is , uh , 0 I would n't take a child to day-care . ###You know ?

138497:4	###SpeakerA15 . ###But \[ I kind of , \+ I \] liked it some ways E_S ###and some ways I did n't . E_S ###Uh , I think 0 the ratio of kids to teacher is really important . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
138511:37	###but I only had her going two days E_S ###and most of the other kids were going more days E_S ###so that was probably my own fault that she did n't , N_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###She went , E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Oh , you know , one thing 0 I noticed *T*-1 is , uh , uh , just , 0 they were trying \[ * to get her \+ *-3 to , teach her \] *-2 to write her name , E_S

138589:57	###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###I do n't know , E_S ###it *EXP*-1 's so hard * to take young kids anywhere for very long .

138605:16	###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it *EXP*-2 \] is , I think 0 *T*-3 , just hard * to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care 0 their own families will *?* *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerA61 . 
138616:4	###I think 0 it 's , ###well , N_S I do n't know , E_S ###\[ then , \+ then \] on the other hand I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's harder * to stay home in some regards .

138642:27	###No , E_S ###\[ it , \+ It \] does n't . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . ###Huh .

140990:4	###and they did pretty good , except this dog is , N_S ###she 's just pretty , E_S ###she 's not smart . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###So , she did n't learn a lot , E_S ###but \[ it , \+ I think 0 it \] calmed her down a little bit , E_S ###and she 's used *-1 to being around other dogs now . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . 
141023:5	###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###and , uh , if they 're not accustomed to something , \[ they , \+ they 're \] really scared . E_S ###So .

141048:27	###so he plays tennis \[ with , \+ with \] the kids . E_S ###We all kind of play tennis as a family , E_S ###except the baby plays in the playground . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh .

141059:24	###Oh , plus we watch a little T V together . E_S ###We really do n't watch , I think 0 *T*-1 , as much T V as a lot of people . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###We do n't have H B O . E_S ###We do get the Disney channel for the kids . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
141096:59	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] it , N_S ###and that 's kind of cutting into \[ your , \+ your \] time . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
141124:16	###Do you work during the day ? E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh , no , E_S ###I do n't work .

E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###That was two days a week , E_S ###and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot . E_S 
141164:7	###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###And then , of course , they have a pretty , um , busy social calendar too . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###You fit it in with all \[ that , \+ that . \] E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah . E_S 
141175:49	###SpeakerB52 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ a lot of people , \+ a lot of people \] \[ s- , \+ set \] their kids in front of the T V and H B O and rent movies \[ and , \+ and , \] kind of leave them to their own means . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###I think , you know , 0 it *EXP*-1 's \[ very , \+ very \] easy * to fall into that trap , E_S 
141210:43	###What , N_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###I 'm a newlywed E_S ###and we 're you know , thinking about *-1 having children sometime in the next couple of years E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
141236:59	###because she has such a flexible schedule , E_S ###but it *EXP*-1 's very hard * to , uh , spend time with the children \[ and , \+ uh , and \] your husband and do everything at once . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah .

141243:5	###But I do feel like it *EXP*-1 's important that you make the time for children because , N_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Well , I think 0 \[ it 's a big , \+ it 's a big , \] um , responsibility . E_S ###You just do n't , have children so that you can continue the lifestyle 0 you had *T*-2 when you were single *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . 
141282:47	###SpeakerB9 . ###And you ? E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we have a pretty big family , E_S ###but most of us , N_S ###well , uh , uh , I am originally from West Virginia . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . 
141289:11	###SpeakerB11 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Most everybody is right in that area . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###That makes it a lot easier . E_S A lot more convenient . E_S 
141302:19	###SpeakerB17 . ###Spec- , N_S ###because it *EXP*-1 is always that hard * to get everyone together . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###They put one together for our family about once every June . E_S ###It was on my grandmother 's birthday , E_S ###but \[ she is , \+ she is \] gone now . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Yeah , E_S

E_S ###It was on my grandmother 's birthday , E_S ###but \[ she is , \+ she is \] gone now . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Yeah , E_S ###see that is kind of what *T*-1 happened with ours . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###SpeakerB41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###is that one of your , uh , N_S ###I mean , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA42 . 
141406:4	###And see , my grandmother is the one that *T*-1 use *-2 to plan this stuff basically . E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###So , unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together , it is kind of like . E_S ###She was like the glue , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I understand . E_S 
141421:51	###SpeakerB63 . ###But , uh , you know , we have relatives scattered * out all over Louisiana , Mississippi , uh , here in Texas E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB67 . 
141435:14	###Then the majority of them are still in the Missouri area . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###Okay .

141481:30	###every year . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###MUMBLEx . N_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###And , uh , still , you wind up *-1 meeting people 0 \[ you , \+ uh , you \] never knew 0 you were related to *T*-2 . Let alone E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB85 .

141916:21	###But most of \[ the ti- , \+ the times \] I find that even if \[ there are , \+ you know , they do have \] like tremors out there , you know , there 'll be a small article *ICH*-1 in the paper about it . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###But , uh . N_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###I sometimes feel like , um , the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS , um , the top headlines are always a murder , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . 
141938:15	###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I 'm sure . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###You know , but , um , I do n't know . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I 'm satisfied , E_S ###I do n't , uh . N_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB63 .

141977:14	###So . Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###Well , we have *-1 to keep *-2 talking , I guess 0 *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###Well , no , E_S ###I guess 0 we can end . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###Yeah , E_S 
142010:29	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###Becau- , I , N_S you know , ###like one , uh , ###well , N_S was it last week , 0 we were supposed *-1 to talk about gardening *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA90 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB99 . ###You know , I mean , some topics , N_S ###really \[ now , \+ you know , now , \] this topic , this is , I mean , N_S 
142058:5	###So , um . N_S ###SpeakerA108 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , I guess 0 I can just say 0 \[ I , \+ \] it *EXP*-1 bothers me that I hear a lot \[ about , \+ \] um , you know , on the news that , N_S ###well , it seems like , I do n't know , some things are sensationalized *-1 ###or some things are , um , E_S you know , ###you 'll hear one report E_S ###and then you 'll hear that \[ it , \+ \] you know , they did n't , um . N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , uh , E_S 
142067:4	###Okay , uh , E_S ###what kind of hobbies do you have *T*-1 Lori ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , I guess , 0 \[ I , \+ uh , I \] like *-1 to play golf . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh .

142076:14	###Uh-huh . E_S ###Where do you play golf *T*-1 in this area ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , we live , uh , pretty close , to the Mesquite Golf Course . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###So , we will play either out there or at Firewheel . E_S 
142080:20	###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###So , we will play either out there or at Firewheel . E_S ###That is usually where we play *T*-1 , E_S ###but I have played you know different courses in in the Dallas area . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###\[ Do you , \+ uh , do you \] ride 
142097:15	###SpeakerA15 . ###I was going *-1 to say , 0 that could be difficult . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###No , sometimes we ride E_S ###and sometimes , uh , we , pull , E_S ###we like *-1 to , to , uh , a lot of the times just walk , uh , for the exercise . E_S ###But N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
142125:16	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###I like the course , ###but I do n't play over there because , \[ you , \+ they \] do n't , uh , you know do n't allow you to pull a cart . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###And , I do n't think 0 a cart damages the turf . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Right . E_S 
142125:93	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###I like the course , ###but I do n't play over there because , \[ you , \+ they \] do n't , uh , you know do n't allow you to pull a cart . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###And , I do n't think 0 a cart damages the turf . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Right . E_S 
142128:19	###but I do n't play over there because , \[ you , \+ they \] do n't , uh , you know do n't allow you to pull a cart . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###And , I do n't think 0 a cart damages the turf . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , the reason why we play over there *T*-1 is because it 's where , since we are a Garland resident , they gave us a special deal where you can get , uh , ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars *T*-2 , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###a hundred dollars E_S 
142132:13	###And , I do n't think 0 a cart damages the turf . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , the reason why we play over there *T*-1 is because it 's where , since we are a Garland resident , they gave us a special deal where you can get , uh , ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars *T*-2 , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###a hundred dollars E_S ###cause it is half price what the normal green fees are *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
142180:37	###SpeakerA45 . ###But I N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Oh well that sounds like fun too . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get *-1 to use them again E_S ###because my boys are still right at the beginning age E_S ###and it is probably going *-1 to be six to eight years before they go to college . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
142190:24	###Well , you need *-1 to , uh , teach them how * to play *T*-2 and take them out on the course with you . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###That 's right . E_S ###Lessons are expensive though . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###Well you can teach them . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Well , they would probably never make it then E_S ###because I do n't think , uh , N_S 
142220:11	###SpeakerB62 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###I took one lesson one other time . E_S ###Besides that , uh , I just , uh , try *-1 to make the club hit the ball . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah , E_S 
142254:12	###She put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###And they have been , N_S ###we thought 0 even with all the cold weather weather 0 we have had *T*-1 they have been blooming just fine . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Oh , they do great . E_S ###I put mine in probably in November . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . 
142303:62	###SpeakerB1 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay , E_S ###so you enjoy camping ? E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . 
142303:103	###SpeakerB1 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay , E_S ###so you enjoy camping ? E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . 
142331:15	###SpeakerA14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###SpeakerA16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###And it *EXP*-1 is cheaper *ICH*-2 * to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it *EXP*-3 is *?* * to rent an apartment add to stress . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . 
142344:16	###SpeakerB21 . ###And , you know , in those those kinds of situations , uh , room rent which *T*-1 is outrageous . N_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###So , my buddy and I , we just camped . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . 
142345:14	###And , you know , in those those kinds of situations , uh , room rent which *T*-1 is outrageous . N_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###So , my buddy and I , we just camped . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###And we figured , what the hell , E_S

143630:127	###SpeakerB18 . ###You sound pretty young for a university professor . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Well , I was pretty young .

143640:26	###At any rate , uh , the topic is fascinating because one of the things 0 I 've done *T*-1 for the past few years is , uh , research the problem from the point of view of , uh , uh , what *T*-2 appears *-4 to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###You may be familiar with cooperative learning .

143658:126	###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh , I think that the combination of , uh , technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way 0 we learn *T*-1 .

145202:7	###Well , that 's a good experience , I think 0 *T*-1 , E_S ###and , uh , there are a lot of things 0 * to think about *T*-1 E_S ###and the articles that *T*-1 are written *-2 on the topic , are pretty good E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###and they kind of boil down to , uh , N_S ###any other important decision you really have *-1 to explore the alternative E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . 
145202:62	###Well , that 's a good experience , I think 0 *T*-1 , E_S ###and , uh , there are a lot of things 0 * to think about *T*-1 E_S ###and the articles that *T*-1 are written *-2 on the topic , are pretty good E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###and they kind of boil down to , uh , N_S ###any other important decision you really have *-1 to explore the alternative E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh .

145248:20	###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh , that makes a big difference . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###I th- , N_S if it 's good , N_S I think 0 *T*-1 it 's very good for the child . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###And if it 's , a loving environment , I think 0 *T*-1 it 's very good E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . 
145255:16	###And if it 's , a loving environment , I think 0 *T*-1 it 's very good E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###and , and that 's really what we 've learned *T*-1 about it . E_S ###She 'll have *-1 to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###but , uh , we feel real fortunate E_S ###and we were able *-1 to , uh , just , uh , choose in the marketplace . E_S 
145322:20	###I think that , uh , my own interest \[ in , \+ in \] \[ development , \+ human development \] leads me to believe that that 's a good sign and that , uh , private enterprise is the way 0 * to go *T*-1 and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way 0 we learn *T*-2 .

146655:18	###I think 0 if we wait *ICH*-3 , uh , which *T*-1 is happening until somebody says 0 we have *-2 to do it it is going *-4 to be to late . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###I have heard reports *ICH*-1 around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I have heard that too . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###And that is not too far away , E_S 
146672:16	###and I can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them E_S ###and there are some fire stations 0 I can take newspapers to *T*-1 E_S ###and that is very inconvenient cause I have *-1 to wait until I have enough of them * to make the trip worthwhile .

146689:65	###SpeakerB13 . ###Oh I know . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###glass E_S ###\[ that can not be , \+ it could be \] recycled *-1 , E_S ###but there is no place 0 * to , N_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###There is no really recycling facilities . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###No . E_S

N_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Besides , well like a law or whatever . E_S 
146712:50	###just because they have *-1 to *?* . You know , E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###SpeakerB25 . ###And you get ticketed *-1 if you do n't do it right .

146842:67	###SpeakerA70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###And I think that it 's just 0 people have got *-1 to be aware .

E_S ###SpeakerA72 . 
146848:23	###SpeakerB71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . ###And , uh , I just look at it , 0 I do n't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why did n't you do something *T*-1 .

146887:7	###So , I still throw away a lot of glass . E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###It is really sad . E_S ###SpeakerA86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And then the packaging thing really grips me .

E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . 
147142:26	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###Um , I guess 0 there 's been a lot of pressure * to , um , do away with the C F C 's in these spray bottles which , *T*-1 has been a real problem .

147159:118	###SpeakerA22 . ###It 's kind of scary .

147341:32	###That way , N_S ###I want *-1 to see the nursing home . If I have *-2 to put him into one . E_S ###You know , where I can go *-2 see it *T*-1 .

147385:5	###And that 's the sad part about it . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I , uh , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###and I think 0 a lot of people who *T*-1 do it now .

147739:63	###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###That 's a good point . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###But , uh , other than that I think 0 maybe it just depends on how you define honesty *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerB56 . 
150115:37	###And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I 've had my car stolen *-1 , E_S ###so maybe that counts . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . 
150142:24	###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I 've actually , \+ I 've \] \[ known , \+ known \] some people that *T*-1 have had their cars stolen *-2 .

E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###My friend had a V W Rabbit , E_S 
150179:6	###Yeah , E_S ###\[ you got *-1 to , \+ you \] crack the steering column E_S ###and you pull the , N_S ###there 's a pin in there that you can pull *T*-1 on these G M cars E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh .

150184:9	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###and you can start it up , basically pretty easily . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###So how do you know this much about , um , * stealing cars *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Well , after I found mine \[ I had *-1 to , \+ I had \] this , N_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###SpeakerA1 . 
150195:36	###SpeakerB2 . ###Um , I really have n't had , uh , too many problems . E_S ###Uh , * seems to me that everything that I buy *T*-1 goes bad just after the warranty runs out . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###I hear that one . E_S ###Have you had any lately go out ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 've had a dryer , an ice maker , a microwave , all three , E_S ###and they , N_S 
150230:21	###so we had *-1 to buy all those , too . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh , * watch out . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###the only thing 0 I 've had problems with *T*-1 is , um , N_S ###I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
150231:7	###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh , * watch out . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###the only thing 0 I 've had problems with *T*-1 is , um , N_S ###I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it 's nontoxic and such *T*-1 , E_S 
150278:34	###so \[ even if I , \+ I think 0 even if I \] \[ had , \+ uh , had \] kept the warranty , the service agreements were with the companies \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 manufactured , E_S ###but still they were through that retailer , E_S ###so I do n't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Wow , E_S ###it 's frustrating . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###But I did n't have *-1 to worry about all that , because they were n't under warranty . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###SpeakerB32 . 
150331:32	###and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay ? E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Um , the tests that , N_S ###well , we test every one electrically . E_S ###We do n't , N_S ###I think 0 they test four or five a day , *-1 actually exploding the air bags E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###\[ and , \+ but \] we do test \[ after , \+ \] during the assembly \[ project , \+ product , \] um , 
150348:19	###so , luckily that 's a product that I have n't had *-1 to test *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###But I think 0 it 's a great idea . E_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm , \] N_S ###* seems like all the good logical ideas take forever *-1 to come about E_S ###but that . N_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Well , they do \[ the , \+ all the \] testing that we have *-1 to do *T*-2 through the government , E_S 
150361:9	###But , uh , even , N_S ###you know , I do n't mind *-1 spending the extra money on the car \[ if , \+ you know , even if \] they pass \[ the savings , \+ the cost \] onto the consumer , because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###I 'm not a real big seat belt , N_S ###my , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###um , I guess 0 we 're going *-1 to \[ talk , \+ \] describe , uh , job benefits , E_S 
150377:45	###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , um , does your company have good benefits \[ in that , \+ in that \] regard ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think , N_S ###I work for a public school \[ system , \+ district \] E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
150378:4	###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , um , does your company have good benefits \[ in that , \+ in that \] regard ?

E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###\[ and , \+ uh , so \] it 's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing *T*-1 , E_S 
150387:31	###\[ and , \+ uh , so \] it 's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing *T*-1 , E_S ###where the school district does , um , 0 the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of , uh , costs *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###But overall , um , I 've been pleased with it over the years . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###I think 0 the biggest frustration is 0 because of the cost of insurance going up every year , our district has had *-1 to \[ alter , \+ uh , you know , change \] companies , E_S 
150417:18	###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Our district did that for the ninety-one *RNR*-1 and the ninety *RNR*-1 \[ school year , \+ or calendar years , \] E_S ###and I was in the H M O , E_S ###and , um , I was *?* because \[ my , \+ my \] same doctor , you know , agreed *-1 to be in it for , uh , N_S ###they usually sign a contract or something E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###and , um , uh , I did have surgery last summer E_S 
150433:4	###But , again , I was fortunate because my doctor agreed *-1 to be in it .

E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###That 's right , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] fairly young myself , E_S ###I 've only been , N_S

150447:113	###SpeakerA31 . ###and , uh , at that time I immediately joined the H M O , E_S ###and I never really , N_S ###so the only doctor 0 \[ I , \+ I 've \] kind of consistently had *T*-1 has been through the H M O , E_S ###and , uh you know , for me it 's worked out real good .

150493:28	###SpeakerB48 . ###\[ It , \+ it \] really , um , N_S ###I do n't think 0 most of our teachers , N_S ###now I 'm not a teacher , E_S ###I am a secretarial executive assistant , E_S ###but I do n't think 0 the teachers could stand the stress \[ all , \+ all \] year long frankly .

150852:35	###And I think 0 even in the elections , they choose who they 're going *-2 to follow *T*-1 and who they 're not *?* *T*-3 , E_S ###and basically you know , if a candidate can get them to follow , then the news will , you know , kind of publicize his name . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###exactly .

151141:10	###Oh , so the deal was that he had , uh , borrowed money from the bank *-1 to buy it , E_S ###and he had n't made the payments . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###So they came *-1 to get it . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB66 .

151255:49	###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . ###Because you 'd probably be , uh , too puritanical E_S ###and N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that was probably it , E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###MUMBLEx . ###SpeakerB36 .

151268:27	###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . 
152407:12	###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh , for the operating staff it 's \[ on a seniority , \+ it 's , you know , based *-1 on how long they 've worked there *T*-2 . \] E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB68 .

152459:10	###SpeakerB8 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###so there is a progressive path , E_S ###but * not being in \[ the \+ say the \] commercial sector , the motivation is n't there for a lot of people uh , like really , N_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###Are they like pretty much train *-1 for a specific job E_S 
152467:27	###SpeakerB12 . ###Are they like pretty much train *-1 for a specific job E_S ###and that what I hired for *T*-1 and then \[ I , \+ \] just very little variation from that . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###somewhat that , E_S ###but then also there just is n't the ability * to in one sense have , uh , a broader scope for * rewarding people for their performances . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
152498:183	###SpeakerB22 . ###But , uh , it was n't necessarily , N_S ###I mean , you know , some people had been there a long time . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we are seeing that here as well . E_S ###Like in some of the large oil companies . There has been massive lay offs . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
152511:85	###SpeakerA27 . ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###No doubt E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah , E_S 
152512:11	###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###No doubt E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###yeah .

152513:32	###Uh-huh . E_S ###No doubt E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Expedient , E_S ###yeah E_S ###that 's exactly it . E_S ###Yeah , E_S 
152537:54	###SpeakerA37 . ###So we , N_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I think 0 that 's one of the things too . E_S ###You get too many management people , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###It 's very easy . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah E_S 
152537:77	###SpeakerA37 . ###So we , N_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I think 0 that 's one of the things too . E_S ###You get too many management people , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###It 's very easy . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah E_S 
152541:16	###I think 0 that 's one of the things too . E_S ###You get too many management people , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###It 's very easy . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah E_S ###and it *EXP*-1 's very easy for them to say , oh this is the best way when they really are n't aware of what all it took *T*-2 * to get the work done *-3 *T*-4 you know . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
152555:8	###Because it 's support people that *T*-1 are providing the speed for it . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but , N_S 
152605:9	###SpeakerB64 . ###whereas yeah in a smaller , N_S ###I think 0 you would be more willing *-2 to either help that person or help it get accomplished *-1 , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
152652:31	###Uh-huh . E_S ###I 'd agree with that . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , Uh , too often I think 0 they are not *?* E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###That 's definitely a problem . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . 
152652:109	###Uh-huh . E_S ###I 'd agree with that . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , Uh , too often I think 0 they are not *?* E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###That 's definitely a problem . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . 
152672:23	###I would feel a little bit uneasy about E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###but the other two I feel 0 *T*-1 , uh , would give either you know , the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
152678:10	###but the other two I feel 0 *T*-1 , uh , would give either you know , the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###And I guess 0 that 's what I am concerned with *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###I , guess 0 \[ I , \+ I \] definitely agree with you , E_S ###but \[ sin- , \+ \] the N_S 
152696:68	###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 there is more of an ability \[ of \+ you know , you know for \] * selecting \[ a jury , \+ two different juries \] that *T*-1 would most of the time come up with \[ the same idea , \+ uh , the same idea \] versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###but , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 there would be a large variation \[ in , \+ in \] * trying *-1 to gage \[ the \+ the \] severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have \[ that \+ that \] measure stick across the board . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah E_S 
152721:11	###Of course a lot of that 's also the ability *ICH*-1 \[ of , \+ of \] the defendant * to , uh , get a good lawyer . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Is n't that the truth ?

152744:29	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] agree with it E_S ###yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA63 . 
152754:52	###it 's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And they are very effective too . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###That the , N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh , even , N_S 
152770:9	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh , the city has dropped their charges against him because \[ their , \+ the \] attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt * to convince the judge . E_S ###So I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh , this is a little bit of the subject , E_S ###but \[ one , \+ one \] thing that I really dislike *T*-1 , uh , also \[ that *T*-2 's , \+ that *T*-3 's \] new \[ is the , uh , \+ is that \] I have heard that there are federal sentences , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well Jackie , uh , on taxes , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I would have *-1 to say , \[ that I , \+ that my \] opinion is that I do think 0 Americans are paying too much in taxes .

152782:51	###I agree . E_S ###I think 0 taxes are high . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Right , E_S ###uh , where you live *T*-1 do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh , uh-huh . E_S 
152789:13	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh , uh-huh . E_S ###In New Hampshire we have , uh , uh , \[ no , \+ no , \] what we call *T*-1 broad base taxes . E_S ###No income tax and no sales tax .

152803:45	###SpeakerB10 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###So , uh , we do have a very low tax rate , E_S ###but you know , combined with the federal income tax .

E_S ###Uh , \[ my , \+ my \] opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state E_S and they say 0 they are going *-1 to send some back , E_S ###\[ it 's like * giving yourself a tra- , \+ it 's like one arm giving the other a transfusion . \] E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . 
152848:33	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh , \[ it , \+ it \] really , uh , N_S ###I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube \[ because , \+ ###Right ###because , \] uh , there 's an old saying *ICH*-1 in amongst taxes and politicians that there 's a fly paper effect E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah .

152867:16	###I , N_S ###* do n't seem like they are doing much with it , E_S ###MUMBLEx I mean there 's plans there E_S ###and now that they are voting and people , you know , getting into MUMBLEx drug and that stuff .

152893:9	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh , there is an interesting proposal that *T*-1 's been going around now for a few years of * having a flat tax . Uh , ten percent or thirteen percent .

153225:48	###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Huh , that 's interesting . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###So , it 's a weird cat . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Huh . We have \[ a , \+ a \] mutt . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###A mutt . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
153247:16	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###and we saw an ad saying 0 it was free , E_S ###so we went down there and picked it up E_S ###and it 's been an excellent dog , E_S ###but it 's my first dog 0 I 've had *T*-1 E_S ###and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while I go to work E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh .

153280:5	###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###But , I mean , that \[ did , \+ did \] more responsibility . When it 's yours and not your brother 's *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah .

153288:11	###SpeakerB46 . ###Well , \[ I just , \+ uh , we 've , \] you know N_S ###when I was growing up *T*-1 \[ I had , \+ we always had \] a dog E_S ###and we had mostly mutts , E_S ###well not mutts , but mixes you know like one or two mix E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###and those dogs always seem *-1 to be the best dogs . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . 
153328:29	###\[ and \+ so , \] N_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Would you ever want a dog in the family ? E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh , \[ we , \+ I \] would *?* . E_S ###\[ We , \+ uh , we \] had a dog that *T*-1 was a , uh , mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###and , uh , I should say a pup E_S 
153332:19	###Uh , \[ we , \+ I \] would *?* . E_S ###\[ We , \+ uh , we \] had a dog that *T*-1 was a , uh , mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh .

153381:4	###and he said yeah , E_S ###he 's been the best dog 0 I 've ever had *T*-1 in my life E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###* just goes everywhere with him . E_S ###\[ I , \+ he \] would have been a great , great dog . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###He just needed a lot of time . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
153391:61	###How do you feel *T*-1 about gun control ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , uh , I mean I do n't think that guns should be outlawed *-1 E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###but it 's going *-1 to , N_S ###a lot of the stuff that , N_S ###I mean all 0 you do *T*-1 is * to get guns ###and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen , Texas not too long ago , 
153404:19	###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###Well , do n't you think that you know , * just having , you know , some , you know almost like a driver 's license be required *-6 you know with stiff penalties if you are found *-5 \[ with , \+ with \] you know a gun that *T*-1 is not registered *-2 or you know that you are not licensed *-3 to carry *T*-4 . E_S ###I mean , It varies from State to State . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that , N_S 
153422:45	###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh , in most States as long as you are n't a convicted felon . You know or on probation or , uh , you know , other obvious things like that . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh , and \[ I know , \+ I know \] that like in a lot of states \[ you could , \+ you could \] be just like released *-1 from a mental hospital the day before .

E_S ###Well , that 's pretty scary . E_S 
153427:11	###Uh , and \[ I know , \+ I know \] that like in a lot of states \[ you could , \+ you could \] be just like released *-1 from a mental hospital the day before .

E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh , yeah , E_S ###\[ I 'd probably , \+ I 'd probably \] say about a five . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
153431:62	###Well , that 's pretty scary . E_S ###So , \[ does , \+ now do \] they want us to say where we feel *T*-1 about it , like in *-2 rating it one to ten . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh , yeah , E_S ###\[ I 'd probably , \+ I 'd probably \] say about a five . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###That 's where I would probably be *T*-1 .

153443:53	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###because I mean I do think that some people need them \[ and , \+ \] like , for protection and stuff E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###and I can understand them wanting *-1 to have them , E_S ###but then again it 's just like all those nuts out there . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Well , you know , uh , uh , no- , E_S 
153462:24	###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh , you know , I mean , the problem though , you know , \[ they , if the , \+ since the \] United States had this , you know , pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think , you know , 0 if you were introduced , you know , any controls , it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###You know , so \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] really kind of a complex problem . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Well , is the crime that bad there in Atlanta ? E_S ###SpeakerA35 . 
153498:39	###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###You know and shotguns are really good because they 're , N_S ###I mean somebody is not going *-1 to break in , steal it , and you know , use it *-2 to mug someone , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh , and you know , you , N_S ###yeah , E_S 
153499:32	###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh , and you know , you , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###I just do n't understand these people , you know , like when \[ they , \+ they \] decide 0 they 're going *-1 to buy a gun 0 *T*-2 to protect themselves *T*-3 . E_S 
153510:18	###they are probably going *-1 to miss the person E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] they 're going *-1 to shoot through five wall , and hit someone , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###I mean a shotgun just really struck me as *-1 being you know a real good defensive weapon . E_S ###You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . 
153527:76	###and , uh , my Dad gave me a gun E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###but I never did go out and practice with it enough * to feel comfortable with it E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh .

153559:14	###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . ###* Set them off .

E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well that 's why I ended up *-1 giving it back to him *T*-2 . E_S 
153578:48	###SpeakerA79 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###So . Well , uh , did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever ? E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ the , \+ did it \] happen at a cafeteria or something ? E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah , E_S ###right . E_S 
153585:13	###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah , E_S ###right . E_S ###\[ That kind of \+ I mean it \] just makes you wonder how people get guns *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###I would be scared *-1 selling guns to people . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay . E_S 
153596:41	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , uh I do n't know that we really have a budget . E_S ###I have a set amount \[ that I , \+ that I \] save *T*-1 .

153621:61	###I do n't need *-1 to *?* . E_S ###I am the only that I have *-1 to keep track of *T*-2 E_S ###so it makes it a little bit easier . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###That 's right .

E_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
153633:33	###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh .

154745:19	###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###and , uh , they had basically decided that there is going *-1 to be a real problem *ICH*-2 here within a few years on solid waste .

154752:85	###Well , it 's not too new . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Right . E_S ###So , \[ what \+ what \] is the E P A recommending *T*-1 now ?

E_S ###SpeakerA13 . 
154754:41	###Right . E_S ###So , \[ what \+ what \] is the E P A recommending *T*-1 now ? E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Oh , they really did n't propose any solutions . E_S ###Actually , \[ they were , \+ the guy was \] pretty negative about the things that the government was doing *T*-1 even though he was from the E P A . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###But , he had a lot of , uh , facts 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] give *T*-2 and , uh , things like how many solid waste plants *T*-1 were being shut *-3 down E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , one of the most interesting things that he was talking about *T*-1 was recycling \[ of , \+ of \] news print . E_S 
154760:27	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###But , he had a lot of , uh , facts 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] give *T*-2 and , uh , things like how many solid waste plants *T*-1 were being shut *-3 down E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , one of the most interesting things that he was talking about *T*-1 was recycling \[ of , \+ of \] news print . E_S ###He was talking about , uh , the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and they could sell it for a while . E_S ###They were able *-1 to sell it for some amount per ton E_S 
154766:58	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and they could sell it for a while . E_S ###They were able *-1 to sell it for some amount per ton E_S ###and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling *T*-3 , they 've collected so much news print that they have *-1 to pay *-2 to have it hauled *-4 away . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Right . E_S ###\[ That 's a , \+ that 's a \] common problem though . E_S ###\[ That it seems , \+ 0 that has happened \] in Dallas as well as New York E_S ###and I try *-1 to recycle all of the newspapers that *T*-2 come to my house E_S 
154786:21	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get *?* to them . Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Well , that 's good . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###So one of the real keys , it sounds like *T*-1 , to * getting recycling for , uh , paper or something like that to go is * to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###There has *-1 to be , uh , a reuse for it . E_S 
154799:47	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###and , uh , I think 0 they are even putting it in the roadways these days E_S ###and they 're making clothes *ICH*-1 now that *T*-2 are recycled . E_S ###Like the recycled plastic coke bottles \[ and \+ and \] milk cartons and things like that . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###And there was a paper presented * at this conference from a guy from Alabama E_S ###and he was kind of hired *-1 to do a study by two departments for the government .

154864:78	###Actually , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Kay . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###I guess 0 we 're talking about exercise , huh ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Oh yeah . E_S ###Uh , I guess partly because of our climate .

E_S ###Uh , there 's psychological pressure against * employing people to do that kind of thing although , uh , scouts and hockey teams and ball teams , those kinds , uh , regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Do they do it with news papers as well ? E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###They have done it some , uh , E_S ###but we have actually quite an extensive network of * collecting news papers .

155242:23	###SpeakerB22 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh , some of the , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Uh , the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying *-1 to put together a , uh , long term financial plan and monthly budget . E_S ###The only thing 0 I do *T*-1 now is , uh , * put the data into Quicken . E_S ###I do n't know if you are familiar with that . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Yeah , E_S 
155250:77	###SpeakerB2 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I have some friends of mine who *T*-1 use Quicken E_S ###and , uh , I 've considered *-1 using it once myself , E_S ###but I decided that the amount of information that *T*-1 would have *-2 to go in would be a lot of time * keeping that up to date .

155266:9	###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , it 's similar problems E_S ###but , uh , we just have the one check book E_S ###and we try *-1 to keep it up to date as much as possible E_S ###and occasionally we will get behind like you say E_S ###but , uh , it does n't really seem *-1 to be \[ too , \+ too \] tight if we just remember *-2 to keep everything \[ up , \+ up \] to date and balanced . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . 
155269:46	###but , uh , we just have the one check book E_S ###and we try *-1 to keep it up to date as much as possible E_S ###and occasionally we will get behind like you say E_S ###but , uh , it does n't really seem *-1 to be \[ too , \+ too \] tight if we just remember *-2 to keep everything \[ up , \+ up \] to date and balanced . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Well , how to you handle that , the long range or medium range planning on finances *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Well , actually we have n't had *-1 to *?* . Uh , until just recently . E_S 
155279:17	###I guess 0 we 've got \[ a , \+ a \] daughter who *T*-1 is eighteen months and another one on the way E_S ###so we needed *-1 to start *-2 doing more of that just for , uh , you know , * saving for college and things like that . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###We \[ tried a way , \+ try *-1 to put \] away two and four thousand a year just for that . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah .

155312:40	###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###But , uh , it *EXP*-1 will be interesting * to see MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Well our situation is just \[ a little bit , \+ kind of the opposite \] of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently , uh , took on a full time job , ###well almost full time . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
155328:17	###But , uh , uh , I was just curious , what , uh , part of the country . N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Oh , Stockton . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###How about you ? E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh , Cincinnati , actually . E_S ###I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with , uh , the western accents or something like that . E_S 
155340:11	###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###\[ I 'm , \+ uh , uh , actually , uh , I \] was kind of interested if you found out about the study by , uh , *-1 reading TELECOM DIGEST E_S ###or was there another ? E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh , a colleague of mine at , uh , work got some information over , uh , the computer network called * INTERNET . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###Yeah , E_S 
155351:71	###but , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###And he just forwarded that on to me E_S ###and , uh , it sounded like it would be an interesting project 0 * to participate in *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###so I sent back MUMBLEx mail . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah , E_S 
155366:8	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh , * probably need *-2 to try *-1 to get back on the topic E_S ###but , uh , it *EXP*-1 's hard * to talk about finances \[ without \+ without \] *-2 getting to , uh , dollar figures I guess 0 *T*-3 you know , E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###we could talk about some of the long range goals E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
155379:31	###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###uh , I guess 0 we will have *-1 to factor that in if we are not working for employers that *T*-2 happen *-3 to fund that . E_S ###It seems like every year my employer just gives back , you know , a little bit your tuition reimbursement . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###I mean they use *-1 to reimburse one hundred percent E_S ###and \[ now it 's , \+ uh , now it 's \] reimbursement depending on the grade 0 you get *T*-1 in class E_S 
155384:4	###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###I mean they use *-1 to reimburse one hundred percent E_S ###and \[ now it 's , \+ uh , now it 's \] reimbursement depending on the grade 0 you get *T*-1 in class E_S ###and , uh , it 's a real shame from what we had *T*-1 before , uh , because we 're , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Anyway , uh .

155386:4	###SpeakerA53 . ###I mean they use *-1 to reimburse one hundred percent E_S ###and \[ now it 's , \+ uh , now it 's \] reimbursement depending on the grade 0 you get *T*-1 in class E_S ###and , uh , it 's a real shame from what we had *T*-1 before , uh , because we 're , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Anyway , uh .

155400:52	###\[ \[ I 'm , \+ I , \] \+ uh , it 's \] called *-1 living within your means .

155409:12	###I do n't really have a budget at the moment .

N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's sort of a problem . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah , E_S 
155415:27	###Yeah , E_S ###that 's sort of a problem . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so uh , what do yo- , N_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###\[ We 're trying , \+ we 're trying \] *-1 to , uh , N_S ###so far we are in the clear credit wise E_S ###but , uh , the other side of it is , N_S ###so , not much on that side of it 0 * to add *T*-1 to it . E_S 
155428:20	###So you can afford *-1 to get a house ? E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we 'd like *-1 to do that some day . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###SpeakerB14 . ###We have this dream . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . 
155433:37	###SpeakerB14 . ###We have this dream . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###But , we do n't know how long it will be a dream *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . 
155460:9	###and it *EXP*-1 's cheaper *ICH*-3 * to live overseas than it *EXP*-2 is *?* * to live here . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###No kidding . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###And it does n't get switched *-1 very easily once you come home . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA31 .

E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###True , E_S ###true enough . E_S 
155523:33	###true enough . E_S ###So , uh , \[ \[ what , \+ what , \] \+ uh , what \] languages *ICH*-1 do you speak *T*-2 besides English , of course ?

155537:40	###And my French is pretty good E_S ###but it 's , uh , MUMBLEx French E_S ###so , uh , I 'm terrified *-1 to speak \[ in , \+ uh in France . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###In \] France .

155563:14	###* Must have been terrible . E_S ###The , uh , N_S ###was it Henry Macon 0 *T*-1 said that \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , language was like a man slowly bleeding to death .

157154:57	###SpeakerA33 . ###I think 0 it 's mainly , 0 people , like , they get the vengeance of it .

157161:93	###SpeakerB36 . ###I used *-1 to live in Georgia E_S ###and , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] big thing down there was , all right , we have capital punishment , E_S ###but if you look at who *T*-1 gets accused *-2 and who *T*-3 are the ones who *T*-4 actually get executed *-5 , it 's very racially related and ethnically related , E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Oh , yeah E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###it 's \[ mainl- , \+ lot of \] blacks . E_S ###Also a lot of young people . E_S 
157165:44	###SpeakerA37 . ###Oh , yeah E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###it 's \[ mainl- , \+ lot of \] blacks . E_S ###Also a lot of young people .

157168:39	###SpeakerA39 . ###it 's \[ mainl- , \+ lot of \] blacks . E_S ###Also a lot of young people .

E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###And , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 when you listen to like \[ \[ the , uh , \+ the , \] \+ the \] victims ' families and things *T*-2 , they 're always talking about , you know , uh , *-1 feeling justified or feeling , you know , like they 've gotten something out of it , E_S ###I mean , my thought has been , 0 once the guy has been imprisoned *-1 , if he goes to jail forever or whatever , if he gets killed *-2 , it should n't make any difference to \[ the , \+ uh , the \] victim 's family . E_S ###The only thing that *T*-1 should really 
157191:6	###\[ You , \+ you \] will work your prison job E_S ###and any money 0 you earn *T*-1 will go to the victim 's family . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right E_S ###and , \[ the , \+ the \] other thing is that , you know , ###I was reading through a book on , uh , \[ geneo , \+ human geneo \] research E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###and there , more and more things like schizophrenia N_S 
157271:14	###I 'm a graduate student E_S ###and , * let 's face it , E_S ###I do n't make any money E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###Well , you can wait till you graduate E_S ###and you 'll have plenty of money , E_S 
157293:5	###But \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 would be \] nice , * just like scrap it and go for the \[ g- , \+ Saturn . \] E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Right , E_S ###would you use that for city driving and racing ?

E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Autocrossing is , N_S 
157318:9	###and it 's interesting . E_S ###They get dominated *-1 by the Corvettes that *T*-2 are also in their class . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I would guess so . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . 
157354:73	###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###and \[ I was , \+ I was \] there this , uh , summer E_S ###and , uh , \[ i- , \+ I \] was really impressed *-1 by \[ the , \+ uh , the , \] uh , factory , uh , tours and such for B M W .

157394:4	###and no two of them are alike . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###And N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah E_S ###that 's , N_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###so it 's like completely opposed . E_S ###I do n't know , E_S 
157411:5	###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah , E_S ###if you can afford that kind of a toy , then , I guess , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###* Let 's face it . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###but \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ B M W -s \] good for that . E_S

157464:11	###SpeakerB92 . ###yeah , E_S ###I 'm not sure if I really want , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Think about , uh , taxes . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I think 0 they 're a necessary evil . E_S ###Uh , I wish 0 the government would operate on the same premise that , uh , businesses operate on *T*-1 E_S ###and that is , uh 0 \[ you , \+ you \] do n't spend more \[ than you , \+ than you \] bring in . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . 
157474:27	###You spend what you have *T*-1 E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think that , the general idea is * to \[ s- , \+ you know , spend , \] uh , during a time of recession \[ that , \+ \] you know , for the deficit spending to help *-1 pick up the economy , E_S ###but they 're running under the assump- , N_S ###you know , the way 0 they 're running it now *T*-1 , they 're \[ h- , \+ \] you know , running it under a deficit spending , you know , while we 're not under a recession , E_S ###so there 's never any surplus coming in * to counter the deficit that we 're running *T*-1 , E_S ###so that 's kind of a basic thing of economics , I guess 0 *T*-3 , * keep *-1 spending , * keep *-2 going into debt , E_S 
157475:114	###and , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think that , the general idea is * to \[ s- , \+ you know , spend , \] uh , during a time of recession \[ that , \+ \] you know , for the deficit spending to help *-1 pick up the economy , E_S ###but they 're running under the assump- , N_S ###you know , the way 0 they 're running it now *T*-1 , they 're \[ h- , \+ \] you know , running it under a deficit spending , you know , while we 're not under a recession , E_S ###so there 's never any surplus coming in * to counter the deficit that we 're running *T*-1 , E_S ###so that 's kind of a basic thing of economics , I guess 0 *T*-3 , * keep *-1 spending , * keep *-2 going into debt , E_S ###you 're not going *-1 to payoff what you owe *T*-2 , E_S 
157486:90	###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , I , N_S ###it just depends . E_S ###Uh , uh , roads are very expensive , uh , commodity ###and so is *T*-2 , uh , utilities 0 they supply *T*-1 and police and fire department , uh , E_S ###you know , they need *-1 to make a living . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###There 's , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
157487:22	###Well , I , N_S ###it just depends . E_S ###Uh , uh , roads are very expensive , uh , commodity ###and so is *T*-2 , uh , utilities 0 they supply *T*-1 and police and fire department , uh , E_S ###you know , they need *-1 to make a living . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###There 's , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###So , I think 0 \[ \[ for , \+ for , \] \+ for \] many years , uh , we 've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who *T*-1 are , uh , to a great extent , public servants uh , 
157487:42	###Well , I , N_S ###it just depends . E_S ###Uh , uh , roads are very expensive , uh , commodity ###and so is *T*-2 , uh , utilities 0 they supply *T*-1 and police and fire department , uh , E_S ###you know , they need *-1 to make a living . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###There 's , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###So , I think 0 \[ \[ for , \+ for , \] \+ for \] many years , uh , we 've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who *T*-1 are , uh , to a great extent , public servants uh , 
157499:96	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###I agree with that . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###But , uh , then again , uh , it 's \[ the , \+ \] hard *-1 to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends *T*-2 on all levels \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , government , including municipalities as well as state and federal governments . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###I guess , N_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] a student right now E_S ###and I do n't make a whole lot of money E_S 
157528:7	###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###We do n't regret *-1 paying taxes . E_S ###We do think that , uh , sometimes , uh , we have a reverse of a regressive tax , a progressive tax . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###And progressive tax , I think 0 *T*-2 , uh , does not give people incentive *-1 to make more money , E_S 
157538:15	###and what I mean *T*-1 by that , the more income 0 you make *T*-2 , the more tax you pay *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###More taxes you pay *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###It should be , I think 0 *T*-1 , a flat percentage E_S ###and , uh , that percentage ought *-1 to be an equitable amount . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Is n't , N_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
157557:129	###SpeakerA31 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Now , that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar \[ for every , \+ for every \] item on there even though there 's , uh , taxes on different things . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###Well is n't , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
157577:4	###The taxes that people do n't think about *T*-1 that , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes 0 you pay *T*-1 , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###But you probably pay more *ICH*-1 percentage wise in other taxes . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###There was that , N_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . 
157583:22	###Uh-huh . E_S ###There was that , N_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###which *T*-1 can- , N_S ###was it Jerry Brown , E_S ###one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for * doing away with all \[ the , \+ the \] tax codes 0 they have *T*-1 now and implementing \[ a f- , \+ I think a flat \] percentage , something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah , E_S ###if you \[ impl- , \+ implemented \] a flat percentage , it would encourage people , uh , *-1 to make more money E_S 
157599:15	###SpeakerA49 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###Exactly . E_S ###That 's , because until , like eight , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###And so , N_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . 
157616:136	###Hi . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay . E_S ###So , uh , with the issue of trial by jury , uh , I actually found the whole question about whether you need \[ \[ a , \+ a unan- , \] \+ a unanimous \] verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Yeah , E_S ###actually , \[ I , \+ I \] agree that that 's an interesting thing . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] believe 0 \[ that 's a , \+ \] \[ for , \+ for \] civil suits it 's not unanimous , right , E_S ###but \[ for , \+ for \] criminal suits it 's unanimous by federal law ? E_S ###SpeakerA4 . 
157620:13	###SpeakerB3 . ###Yeah , E_S ###actually , \[ I , \+ I \] agree that that 's an interesting thing . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] believe 0 \[ that 's a , \+ \] \[ for , \+ for \] civil suits it 's not unanimous , right , E_S ###but \[ for , \+ for \] criminal suits it 's unanimous by federal law ? E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###I do n't know if it *EXP*-1 's even true that it 's always unanimous because I thought 0 there were cases \[ where , \+ uh , I do n't know if it 's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors , but where \] it *EXP*-2 was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I actually thought 0 I 'd read that , too E_S 
157627:18	###SpeakerB5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I actually thought 0 I 'd read that , too E_S ###and that 's why I phrased it that way *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###I wonder , E_S ###\[ the difference , \+ yeah , the difference \] could be that for , uh , \[ state , \+ if there is such a thing , state \] felonies versus federal felonies that \[ federal , \+ things that *T*-1 are under federal \] jurisdiction require the unanimous vote , E_S ###and things that *T*-1 are under state jurisdiction , even criminal do n't require , N_S 
157630:28	###and that 's why I phrased it that way *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###I wonder , E_S ###\[ the difference , \+ yeah , the difference \] could be that for , uh , \[ state , \+ if there is such a thing , state \] felonies versus federal felonies that \[ federal , \+ things that *T*-1 are under federal \] jurisdiction require the unanimous vote , E_S ###and things that *T*-1 are under state jurisdiction , even criminal do n't require , N_S ###but I do n't know what \[ the , \+ the \] laws , N_S ###do you think that that 's an unreasonable , uh , requirement that they be unanimous ? E_S ###SpeakerA8 . 
157636:48	###and things that *T*-1 are under state jurisdiction , even criminal do n't require , N_S ###but I do n't know what \[ the , \+ the \] laws , N_S ###do you think that that 's an unreasonable , uh , requirement that they be unanimous ? E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###Well , I 'd be curious as to what the , uh , requirement for \[ a , \+ an \] acquittal is *T*-1 . E_S ###And \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be wrong * to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if , you know , six or seven voted * not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal . E_S ###But I do n't know whether you need \[ an , \+ a \] unanimous , uh , vote of not guilty *-1 to acquit . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that , \+ that \] would be an interesting change . E_S 
157662:30	###but I 've never actually even made it into \[ the , \+ the \] jury box . \[ And , \+ \] because there have always been a number of people E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] I 've never gotten up there *-1 to answer any of the questions . E_S ###Uh , I , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###I also think 0 that would be really good . E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerA16 . 
157662:57	###but I 've never actually even made it into \[ the , \+ the \] jury box . \[ And , \+ \] because there have always been a number of people E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] I 've never gotten up there *-1 to answer any of the questions . E_S ###Uh , I , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###I also think 0 that would be really good . E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerA16 . 
157662:112	###but I 've never actually even made it into \[ the , \+ the \] jury box . \[ And , \+ \] because there have always been a number of people E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] I 've never gotten up there *-1 to answer any of the questions . E_S ###Uh , I , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###I also think 0 that would be really good . E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerA16 . 
157668:134	###yeah , E_S ###I also think 0 that would be really good . E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Well , the people 0 I know *T*-1 who *T*-2 have served have said that usually what *T*-3 ends up *-4 happening is that , you know , after initially * finding out where people stand *T*-5 , that the whole deliberation usually results , if there is \[ a , \+ you know , something like a \] nine , three \[ or , \+ or \] more severe \[ and , \+ and \] the people in the majority trying *-6 to convince the minority that they 're right E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###and in fact , I 'm not sure that that 's any more , uh , liable *-1 to get rid *-2 of the reasonable doubt \[ than , \+ than \] anything else . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . 
157683:37	###and in some cases if it 's a long trial , the desire *ICH*-1 of people *-2 to get out of there and not be stuck *-2 in there for a very long time , that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 'd read one book , I think 0 it was calls *-1 TRIAL BY JURY of all things , that , uh *T*-2 went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases , and in many cases *-3 looking \[ at what *T*-4 had , \+ \] at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right , went back to the jurors , uh , based on the deliberations . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###SpeakerB25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . 
157732:56	###He helps me out a lot E_S ###and I get paid *-1 monthly , E_S ###so that 's kind of hard * to have a budget . E_S ###My mother , uh , does n't get paid *-1 much money , E_S ###so her budget is , uh , just , uh , planning for I R A 's . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###I see , E_S ###I see . E_S ###Well , good , E_S ###I 'm kind of in a different situation , E_S 
157748:14	###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###I 'm on a salary E_S ###so I do n't get any overtime or anything like that E_S ###but , We have a fixed income E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and we have *-1 to make * sure that , uh , every dollar 0 we have *T*-2 \[ will , \+ is \] spent *-3 accordingly E_S 
157753:63	###but , We have a fixed income E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and we have *-1 to make * sure that , uh , every dollar 0 we have *T*-2 \[ will , \+ is \] spent *-3 accordingly E_S ###and , uh , what we try and do *T*-1 * \[ to , \+ to \] stick to our monthly budget is 0 we pretty much have , you know , the house payment , E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###we have the insurance premiums , uh , utilities and so forth E_S 
157763:38	###and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know 0 we 're going *-1 to spend *T*-2 and set that money aside , E_S ###and we also try and set aside money for savings , set aside money for \[ the coll- , \+ the kids ' \[ education \+ college education , \] \] the future and , uh , set aside money for bonds E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] we also set aside an emergency fund E_S ###because \[ we 've , \+ uh , we 've \] been married for about ten years E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###That sounds good . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
157771:5	###That sounds good . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###and we find out that , you know , no matter what kind of budget you stick on *T*-1 , there 's always going *-2 to be an unexpected car repair or something happen * with the house , that you have *-3 to have money *ICH*-6 for *T*-4 and , uh , not enough * to go and to take a loan out , but , uh , you have *-5 to have money for *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###And , uh , then we have , you know , N_S 
157831:14	###and my sister had gotten through college , E_S ###but I was still in high school , E_S ###and my mother paid for a lot of my sister 's college while my parents were together E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yes .

160034:85	###That 's pretty good , you know . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ uh , it \] saves a third off on taxes or something . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , it depends on which company you work for *T*-1 . E_S ###I know that , like , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] one plan that everyone seems *-1 to be in *T*-2 , in my place is , uh , you know , \[ you , \+ uh , * think 0 you \] call it *RNR*-3 plan D . E_S ###Deductibles are really high , E_S ###it 's like fifteen hundred dollars , E_S ###but if you go for the other ones you 're paying too much money for them because \[ it 's unlikely , \+ if you 're \[ f- , \+ relatively , \] uh , healthy , then it 's really unlikely \] that you 'd use that \[ much , \+ amount \] of money , you know . E_S ###So , \[ \[ the- , \+ \] it , \+ you know , someone \] did start a cost benefit analysis , E_S 
160040:169	###Deductibles are really high , E_S ###it 's like fifteen hundred dollars , E_S ###but if you go for the other ones you 're paying too much money for them because \[ it 's unlikely , \+ if you 're \[ f- , \+ relatively , \] uh , healthy , then it 's really unlikely \] that you 'd use that \[ much , \+ amount \] of money , you know .

E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess , E_S ###uh , on the other hand , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] \[ had a similar , \+ had a similar \] health plan E_S ###and , uh , one of my kids was in a car accident E_S 
160064:21	###SpeakerB28 . ###Oh , well . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh , well , I do n't know , E_S ###I think 0 other than health insurance , I think , uh , you know , an extra week of , uh , time off would be nice .

160090:21	###\[ and , \+ and \] they , N_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh , with the telecommunications type of company , supposedly you , used *-1 to be much more stable .

E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###So you work for Bell or something like that ? E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah , E_S 
160120:48	###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but they , \[ no , \+ no \] longer . N_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###I do n't think so . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh , * hearing a lo- , N_S 
160128:25	###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh , * hearing a lo- , N_S ###\[ there 's always , \+ they 're always \] laying people off , which *T*-2 is another benefit that you can have *T*-1 other than salary is trade that off for security .

160153:75	###SpeakerB2 . ###Okay , E_S ###well , Mark , our situation is that we do have a daughter that *T*-1 is , uh , in the situation of *-2 choosing college . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh .

160203:98	###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh , I guess 0 there 's a difference in , N_S ###here the , N_S ###at least , the university here in Saskatoon is primarily , uh , off campus resident students . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###Like , they just live in the community . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
160213:35	###Uh , you know , I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities *ICH*-3 , particularly as they get *-1 to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is , uh , is right on campus as well *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh .

160246:86	###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh , you know , as sort of some development and some training , uh , E_S ###like it *EXP*-1 's easy enough * to crank out graduates , ###but * to really challenge them E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 .

160300:7	###SpeakerB64 . ###Right . E_S ###Best training in the world is not going *-1 to \[ f- , \+ put food \] on your table . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###I do n't believe that we 're , N_S ###SpeakerB2 .

E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Actually , uh , they just recently started a policy of * testing drugs , which *T*-1 was kind of interesting , E_S 
163532:4	###because they 're at a higher risk of exposure E_S ###and blood screening is part of that E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I \] think that drugs , N_S ###they do test for drugs in that capacity , E_S ###but it 's not their exclusive , N_S ###\[ it 's just part , \+ it 's just something \] that *T*-1 turns up in the other parameters that they test for *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###But I think 0 it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have *-1 to exercise some quick judgment in the field .

E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Other than that they do n't have random testing or anything like that , E_S ###but , a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first . E_S

163589:18	###but I think 0 its relevance is pretty limited . E_S ###I mean , I think , you know , N_S ###in your case , I do n't think that you should necessarily be subjected *-1 to drug testing .

163908:60	###SpeakerA53 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Madonna can do anything E_S ###and it would be considered *-1 good because it 's Madonna , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Right .

E_S 
164029:17	###But mostly petty things and , \[ \[ \[ n- , \+ no , \] \+ nothing , \] \+ nothing \] really too big . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Right , E_S ###well , I guess 0 here we run into that sometime , E_S ###but I guess 0 a lot of crimes are done *-1 with apartment type break ins that type , not much home break ins . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###There are some , but \[ not , \+ not \] very high . E_S ###Uh , as far as tellers and things like that , it 's not extremely high either . E_S 
164061:74	###there 's a crime . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but , uh , I guess 0 most of the things that *T*-1 happen around here \[ are , \+ are \] pretty , uh , innocuous .

164086:127	###SpeakerB28 . ###so you really not making a sizeable profit .

E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###You know , \[ I , \+ just * to diverge a little bit , uh , I \] live in an apartment . E_S ###Right now I 'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh E_S ###and , uh , the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
164093:36	###SpeakerB30 . ###Right .

164106:25	###SpeakerA37 . ###there 's a T V and a V C R E_S ###and , \[ they could , \+ uh , they could \] get in pretty easy \[ and , \+ and \] especially , uh , since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open , you know , while they 're upstairs *-1 playing music , E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###it could still happen then . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true , E_S 
164148:42	###SpeakerB10 . ###and the car 0 I get *-1 to drive *T*-2 is a , uh , Nissan Sentra that *T*-3 's going *-4 to be ten years old next month E_S ###so , I think about , uh , *-1 sprucing that up in a couple years if I can *?* .

164168:14	###Something a little seating room . E_S ###How about you ? E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Well , I think 0 the next car 0 we get *T*-1 will probably be a , ###well N_S \[ I , \+ I \] like Buicks .

164198:22	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And , uh , you know , V eights seem *-1 to be a return to the days of , you know , ten or twelve miles a gallon . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Right .

164220:10	###Uh , not really , uh , you know , E_S ###it 's a two wheel drive truck E_S ###and I figure 0 if it 's so bad that I need a four wheel drive , I probably ought *-1 to be home anyway . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Actually , uh , pretty good way of * looking at it , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###\[ We , \+ uh , we \] had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . 
164229:22	###SpeakerB40 . ###A case where there was a , sort of freak ice storm *T*-1 E_S ###and we were n't aware of it , and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car , E_S ###and , this is a rear wheel drive model .

164243:48	###Mazda , E_S ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###And , uh , we 're pleased with it in terms of comfort , and , uh , driveability . E_S ###Fuel economy is n't great , * being a mini van , E_S ###but , uh it 's real nice for * carrying around our kids and others E_S ###and it 's , uh , got some nice features in terms of * being able *-1 to remove seats and flip them around E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
164265:51	###So , I know 0 \[ \[ if we were , \+ if we had kids still at home , \] \+ we 're in our fifties now , but , if we had kids still at home , \] we 'd certainly have *-1 to seriously consider a van just for their functional value . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think that we 're going *-1 to be , uh , owning a mini van for some years 0 *T*-2 to come . E_S ###Probably till the kids are out of , uh , high school anyway . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###What about , uh , all wheel drive ? E_S ###Is that something that you 'd be interested in *T*-1 E_S ###or is that , N_S ###SpeakerB56 . 
164280:5	###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###uh , again , like you , if conditions \[ are , \+ are \] that bad , I probably do n't want *-1 to be driving anyway . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###So I know 0 I 'd be happy with \[ a , \+ a \] reasonable , uh , four door . E_S ###You know , again , \[ we 've , \+ we 've \] got the same issue with *-1 getting kids into the , N_S ###SpeakerA1 .

E_S ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB37 . 
165282:4	###SpeakerB51 . ###SpeakerA52 . ###Right , E_S ###they 're kind of the leaders right now , you know . E_S ###I used *-1 to see all those commercials for Windows , you know , E_S ###and you 're like , oh , gee , they 're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###SpeakerA54 . ###SpeakerB55 . ###Really , E_S 
165292:44	###why do n't they just say , almost a Mac for half the price *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###Yeah , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###They 'd sell more if they were honest . E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###Exactly , E_S ###almost is the key word , there , too , you know , because \[ \[ I , \+ I \] really , \+ I 've \] used both E_S ###and I really do n't see an advantage of Windows at all . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . 
165351:28	###Well , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] all right . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###But it *EXP*-2 's sort of like * surfing on the wave of future shock *-1 to you know , keep up with the changes as they happen . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###SpeakerA80 . ###Something that I find *T*-1 uncomfortable is , you know , 0 \[ you , \+ you \] want *-3 to buy something , ###say 0 you want *-2 to buy a personal computer E_S 
165351:64	###Well , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] all right . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###But it *EXP*-2 's sort of like * surfing on the wave of future shock *-1 to you know , keep up with the changes as they happen .

165357:31	###SpeakerB79 . ###SpeakerA80 . ###Something that I find *T*-1 uncomfortable is , you know , 0 \[ you , \+ you \] want *-3 to buy something , ###say 0 you want *-2 to buy a personal computer E_S ###and you got *-1 to think about what kind of memory you want *-2 to get *T*-3 and what kind of technology that you want *-4 to go for *T*-5 , you know , E_S ###* \[ let , \+ let 's \] take the example , the modem for , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###Okay , E_S 
165374:11	###and then , the reason 0 I did that *T*-1 was because I do n't have a scope E_S ###and it has eight spark plugs E_S ###and it *EXP*-1 's hard * \[ to , \+ to \] \[ get \+ get \] at them E_S ###and plus the time on them . E_S ###I just do n't have time any more . E_S ###Uh , as far as maintenance tasks that I do *T*-1 myself , \[ I , \+ I \] usually change the oil and wash the air filter E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I \] had an occasion 0 * \[ to change , \+ to have *-2 to change \] the battery *T*-1 once , E_S ###but , \[ the brakes , \+ I was really surprised that the brakes \] . N_S ###I wanted , N_S ###I do have the background . E_S 
165386:7	###and the \[ lube , \+ lubrication \] system needs *-1 to be lubricated *-2 ###and N_S so \[ I , \+ I \] stay on top of that E_S ###but \[ I \+ I \] wanted my front wheels , E_S ###I wanted the bearings packed *-1 E_S ###and they wanted something like fifteen dollars , uh , a front or something like that E_S ###or maybe it *EXP*-1 was thirty dollars * to do it E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###* Just to pack the bearings ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###* just to pack the bearings , E_S 
165416:7	###and they \[ re- , \+ repacked \] the the wheel bearings . E_S ###Yeah E_S ###but , uh , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] had considerable experience . E_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ you might say 0 I 'm , \] uh , uh , good back yard mechanic E_S ###and \[ I , \+ you know , I \] took auto shop in high school , E_S ###it 's been a while back , E_S ###but \[ I , \+ I \] still have a pretty good feel for it , E_S ###but one thing 0 I did n't know *T*-1 is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff *T*-2 and most of the cars , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] had bigger cars E_S ###and the brakes *ICH*-1 go out fairly rapidly on those E_S 
165423:40	###but one thing 0 I did n't know *T*-1 is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff *T*-2 and most of the cars , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] had bigger cars E_S ###and the brakes *ICH*-1 go out fairly rapidly on those E_S ###and what I was surprised at *T*-1 is that on my little Nissan ###I bought the truck with about sixty thousand , ###I have almost one hundred and ten , E_S ###so I drove on those brake pads for , uh , you know , forty-five thousand miles E_S ###and there was hardly any wear to them . E_S ###So those small little trucks and cars like that , \[ they just \+ \] the longevity of the brake pads is really good . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
165478:10	###SpeakerB28 . ###Well , \[ there 's three , \+ there 's three \] pulleys that you change *T*-1 . E_S ###You change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and , uh , the water pump pulley . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###That 's the vibration dampener , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
165572:11	###Uh , \[ if it 's , \+ if it 's , \] N_S ###\[ I am kind of , \+ uh , uh , I 'm pretty \] bad about procrastinating E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###and one of these days I am going *-1 to do something about that I believe 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . 
165637:14	###And \[ that , \+ that 's \] kind of handy . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###because if you do n't see it , you do n't miss it MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Yeah , E_S ###if N_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###You do n't spend it . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###you have something 0 *T*-1 to take it out . E_S

165706:18	###SpeakerA68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###So , I try *-1 not to , you know , N_S ###\[ we do n't , \+ you know , I do n't \] ask for more . E_S ###I mean I just try and make it on that . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . 
165717:17	###SpeakerA72 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###SpeakerA74 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###and , uh , \[ you can , \+ you can \] really waste a lot of money that way . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . 
165754:44	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###You will see that all of a sudden \[ you 're paying , \+ you 're trying \] *-1 to decide whether you are going *-2 to do , you know , soccer and piano and all these choices that they have *T*-3 of activities 0 * to do *T*-4 E_S ###SpeakerA90 . ###Yeah E_S ###when , N_S ###SpeakerB91 . ###SpeakerA92 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB93 . 
165758:4	###Yeah E_S ###when , N_S ###SpeakerB91 . ###SpeakerA92 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB93 . ###and then you really have *-1 to start *-2 saying okay , now what can we afford *T*-3 you know , E_S ###SpeakerA94 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB95 . 
165760:36	###SpeakerB91 . ###SpeakerA92 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB93 . ###and then you really have *-1 to start *-2 saying okay , now what can we afford *T*-3 you know , E_S ###SpeakerA94 . ###Yeah .

165769:28	###and then you have *-1 to really sit down and plan some more E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , but \] I think 0 when we were back at your age *T*-1 , we did n't have much of a budget E_S ###SpeakerA96 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB99 . 
165799:72	###I 'd better get back to the subject . E_S ###SpeakerA108 . ###Oh , well . E_S ###SpeakerB109 . ###But , uh , budgeting . E_S ###I found , you know , 0 I feel a lot better . E_S ###You know , we use *-1 to work out of one check book E_S ###SpeakerA110 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB111 . 
165803:34	###But , uh , budgeting . E_S ###I found , you know , 0 I feel a lot better . E_S ###You know , we use *-1 to work out of one check book E_S ###SpeakerA110 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA112 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB113 . 
165821:38	###SpeakerA3 . ###Ooh , that 's great . E_S ###Actually that 's kind of the type of car that \[ I , \+ I 'm \] thinking about 0 we might get *T*-1 . E_S ###Saturns , you ca n't go to a dealer unless you go to \[ a , \+ a \] Saturn dealer . \[ This , \+ this \] offshoot of G M . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . 
165837:19	###my card and , uh , desires tend *-1 to be pretty picky E_S ###and so , uh . N_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Well , like what ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Well , * let 's see . E_S ###\[ I li- , \+ I like \] cars that *T*-1 are designed *-2 \[ with , \+ with \] human beings in mind , E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###and that 's not just the driver and the passenger E_S 
165858:7	###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I 've got a sixty-five Mustang E_S ###\[ and I , \+ and I \] do \[ the work on , \+ most of the work on \] that myself . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Ooh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
165905:47	###That 's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about *T*-1 . E_S ###Actually , \[ the car , \+ one of the cars \] 0 we 'd most like *-2 to get *T*-3 would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they 're actually one of the cheaper cars that *T*-1 have dual side air bags . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . ###That 's a real nice car , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . 
165914:35	###SpeakerB38 . ###I 've driven some , uh , Tauruses *ICH*-2 over the last couple of years when I 've been on business trips *T*-1 . Uh , as rental cars . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###And I 've always been very impressed with the Taurus . E_S ###It 's a really nice car . E_S ###I think 0 \[ it 's very \+ , it 's a \] stylish car both inside and out . E_S ###It 's comfortable 0 * to drive *T*-2 . E_S ###Uh , reasonable performance , E_S 
165945:4	###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###But the thing is that it 's twenty thousand dollars . E_S ###Actually , \[ my , \+ my \] wife and I are actually \[ thinking , \+ contemplating \] *-1 buying a new car in the next year and a half or so . E_S ###So we 're actually been looking around and thinking about things . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###We 'd like *-1 to get like a N_S ###oh , I do n't know . E_S 
165968:23	###yeah , E_S ###\[ that , \+ that \] would be a good deal 0 * to go with *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###And the other thing 0 we 're looking at *T*-1 is the Saturns too . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Because they looked really nice . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
165969:16	###\[ that , \+ that \] would be a good deal 0 * to go with *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###And the other thing 0 we 're looking at *T*-1 is the Saturns too . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Because they looked really nice . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###\[ What do you , \+ what do you \] looking for *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] those ? E_S 
165972:19	###SpeakerB58 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Because they looked really nice . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###\[ What do you , \+ what do you \] looking for *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] those ? E_S ###\[ What , \+ what \] *T*-1 attracts you to the Saturns ? E_S ###\[ Or , \+ or , \] of course , we 've already talked , you know , N_S ###the Taurus is safe . E_S 
165987:35	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###But one of \[ the , \+ the \] two things that I 'm really , N_S ###\[ \[ the , \+ the \] \+ I 'd say 0 the \] most important thing is a car that *T*-1 's not going *-2 to fall apart . That *T*-3 does n't have problems . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###You set down . E_S ###You look at consumer reports . E_S ###We 've been pouring over consumer reports E_S 
166006:4	###And the other one \[ is , \+ are \] the Saturns . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###So those two things . E_S ###And then , you know , we kind of want a four door . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay . E_S 
166023:21	###and they do have bins set * up . E_S ###But I live in \[ a , \+ a \] metropolitan area E_S ###and , uh , they 're not , uh , too inclined *-1 to do something as aggressive as that . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Well , here they \[ and , \+ \] N_S ###uh , * live in an apartment complex . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And they only have one set of recycling bins , one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters . E_S 
166032:5	###And they only have one set of recycling bins , one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters . E_S ###So a lot of the people who *T*-1 live up front do n't bother *-2 to recycle because , you know , it *EXP*-3 's too far * to carry the stuff to the other bins . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###\[ \[ I , \+ I know 0 a lot , \] \+ I think 0 a lot \] of , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] issues with regard to recycling are that , uh , people have *-1 to be motivated *-2 \[ to do , \+ to do \] something like that because it does take extra effort . E_S ###Whether N_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ and I think that , \] \+ and I know \] 0 Massachusetts has , N_S ###a bottle bill was passed *-1 E_S ###and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now , E_S ###and the majority of the incentive in * recycling bottles probably , * believe it or not , is just * to get the extra nickel at \[ the , uh , \+ the \] store and not , uh , N_S ###that 's the majority of people that I know of *T*-1 anyways . E_S 
166058:148	###Uh , \[ and , \+ and \] matter of fact , I think 0 it took like three tries \[ t- , \+ for \] it to go through . E_S ###\[ But , \+ and \] it 's been pretty successful E_S ###and people notice it as far as , uh , highways being , uh , you know , N_S ###people would \[ dr- , \+ have a drink \] of soda , E_S ###instead of *-1 throwing out the window , \[ they , \+ they \] keep the bottle E_S ###so \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] been a ecologically sound policy \[ and , \+ \] you know , \[ as , \+ as \] far as * recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth . E_S ###But more importantly , it 's recycling reusable materials back into , uh , manufacturing . E_S ###And that 's the big thing , I think 0 *T*-3 , that \[ th- , \+ they \] try *-1 to promote *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right . E_S 
166074:40	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###\[ Th- , \+ there \] definitely has *-1 to be a motivation factor E_S ###and I know that , \[ at w- , \+ where I work *T*-1 , \] N_S ###I work for a defense contractor . E_S ###And there 's a big push on for * recycling , uh , paper materials , you know , computer output paper and also * to decrease the amount of , uh , Styrofoam usage because of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] process involved in Styrofoam \[ and , \+ and \] the whole eco issue and that . E_S ###\[ And , \+ and \] they 're very proactive E_S ###and , uh , matter of fact , they give you discounts if you use , uh , china wear rather than , uh , Styrofoam stuff , E_S ###\[ so . \+ So , \] \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ it 's \] incentives like that that *T*-1 get \[ people \+ people \] more conscious of it . E_S 
166085:7	###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , \[ I know , \+ uh , I believe \] 0 it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books *T*-1 . E_S ###* Uh , usually have them come from MUMBLEx you know , projects *-1 to collect old ones . E_S ###* Usually just get dumped *-1 out with the trash . E_S ###And phone books are a large volume of annual trash . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ They , \+ they \] just , N_S ###matter of fact , \[ that , \+ that \] reminded me of an article 0 I saw *T*-1 in the pa- , N_S ###the local schools , you could send your phone book \[ to your , \+ uh , \[ to , \+ with \] your \] kid to school E_S 
166106:9	###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Now I think 0 they 've come up with some way of , uh , * pulling the glue out . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Uh , * let 's see . E_S ###How \[ about , \+ uh , * let 's see , about \] ten years ago , E_S 
166119:9	###\[ They , \+ they \] did more things together . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , they ate dinner at the table together . E_S ###Uh , the parents usually took out \[ time , \+ uh , you know , more time \] than they do now *-1 to come with the children and just spend the day *-2 doing a family activity . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh , although I 'm not a mother , \[ I , \+ I \] still think that , uh , a lot has changed since ten years ago . E_S 
166151:21	###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###Um . It depends . E_S ###Uh , it *EXP*-2 's hard 0 * to say *T*-1 because I think 0 people were busy ten twenty years ago too . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh , I just , N_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
166168:22	###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###So there 's maybe a five year gap between us . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###So , uh . N_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###\[ I just , \+ I \] think that things \[ \[ were a bit , \+ were , \] \+ have been \] busy all along . E_S 
166206:138	###No , E_S ###I do n't think that . E_S ###But then there are a lot of people \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 do n't have that . But , that really *T*-2 do need *-3 to work .

166222:4	###SpeakerA49 . ###SpeakerB50 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh .

167035:40	###SpeakerB26 . ###So , that 's why the defense is there *-1 picking through them *T*-4 , whereas at the same time , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] prosecutor sitting there *-3 picking through them because he wants somebody who *T*-2 will give him , uh , a guilty verdict if the facts warrant .

167067:7	###Uh , and I think 0 that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure . As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure . Also , may be a more consistent sentencing procedure . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Well , I suppose 0 you may be right on that .

167080:7	###Oh , is it *?* ? E_S ###Oh , I did n't realize that . E_S ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###At least in California , they 're supposed *-1 to be *?* .

167088:21	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###But when it comes to what kind of sentence you 're going *-1 to lay *T*-2 down *T*-3 , I think \[ that , \+ uh , that \] they should *?* .

167095:5	###They get too boring . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###So , \[ you , \+ what you 're \] saying *T*-1 is this , if there is the second offense , then you execute them .

E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###So you got *-1 to give them either more time in the system or a different process that *T*-2 will hopefully work better . E_S 
167112:25	###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Like what ? E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Well , uh , say , embezzlement , right . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Ri- , N_S ###SpeakerB64 .

167250:112	###SpeakerA13 . ###Well , you know , there 's this old , uh , Jewish , is it , saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .

167762:89	###It 's very generous E_S ###and I usually have extra . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###And so then that can go , uh , you know , either back into our checking account E_S ###or I can just carry it over . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB78 .

167804:13	###SpeakerB90 . ###Yes . E_S ###We have a household budget . E_S ###Like we 're going *-1 to need *-2 to buy a bed for my daughter that *T*-3 's coming out of her crib this year .

168017:38	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###SpeakerA6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Definitely .

E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . 
168021:48	###Definitely . E_S ###Here in Utah up along the Wasatch MUMBLEx along the western side \[ of the , \+ of these \] Rocky Mountains here , where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo *T*-1 E_S and Logan 's up in the valley a little bit further north , E_S we get a lot of pollution E_S ###and it 's like seventy percent of it is from cars .

168042:24	###SpeakerA14 . ###SpeakerB15 . ###and , uh , uh , it 's supposed *-1 to have about the worst air pollution . E_S ###I think probably due to , uh , a lot of students going back and forth to school . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###And then we 're right next to Interstate Five also . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###They 're getting serious about things like , uh , mandatory , N_S

168089:7	###what they do *T*-1 , E_S they do several different types of things .

E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###And ... N_S ###SpeakerB33 . 
168113:83	###\[ And , \+ and \] the idea being that \[ if you just tuned up all the cars , \+ well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars \] that *T*-1 were producing like fifty percent of \[ the , \+ the \] pollution then , you know , \[ you , \+ it 'd \] be one way 0 * to cut the pollution in half *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's neat . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###SpeakerB41 . ###But it 's also been , uh , oh , you know , N_S ###everybody is talking about * using more mass transient here E_S ###but \[ it , \+ uh , it 's \] tough , you know . E_S ###Like \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] looked into *-1 riding the bus to work E_S 
168122:88	###Like \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] looked into *-1 riding the bus to work E_S ###and I can drive to work \[ in , \+ \] uh *ICH*-2 , and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor .

168130:22	###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###\[ So \+ so \] \[ \[ it \+ it 's , \] \+ it *EXP*-3 's \] not hard * to see \[ why , \+ why \] I keep *-1 driving *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###Yeah .

168140:40	###Basically , \[ what , \+ what \] your personal opinion *ICH*-3 is *T*-2 on it . E_S ###Uh , \[ this is , \+ this is \] really for a speech research project 0 they 're doing *T*-1 E_S ###so , uh , I do n't know . E_S ###Florida is pretty good about recycling is n't it *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Well , they just kicked it off down here \[ in , \+ in \] Sarasota county . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Oh , they did ? E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Uh , they had been doing it , E_S 
168157:7	###And , uh , they 've got these , I do n't know what , if you 're familiar with Sarasota county at all . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Not quite , E_S ###no .

168167:4	###And what they 've done *T*-1 is they 've broken everything down into garbage . Uh , yard trash . Plastic , \[ cr- , \+ cans \] and glass . And then , uh , paper . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###SpeakerB15 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###SpeakerB17 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . 
168185:7	###SpeakerB23 . ###Oh , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] good . E_S ###* Let me ask you this . E_S ###Do they require you to presort it ? E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###Yeah .

168202:4	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###It was really pretty good if you 're lazy like I am *?* , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###right .

168333:6	###up here \[ the , \+ the \] city provides them .

168394:128	###SpeakerB101 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###And it 's like , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Your turn . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Oh , \[ I , \+ I \] start . E_S ###Okay . E_S ###Well , uh , we keep a budget to an extent . E_S 
168402:65	###Okay . E_S ###Well , uh , we keep a budget to an extent .

168908:41	###Oh , I do n't know . E_S ###I had a little bit more time 0 *-1 to think about it *T*-2 . E_S ###I was thinking of , like , uh , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###I \[ was ju- , \+ started \] *-1 to think about all the big , you know , data bases 0 they have *T*-2 with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those , you know , demographics studies that they do *T*-4 that , *T*-5 um , you know , have , who *T*-6 knows , how much , you know , stuff about all the purchases that you 've made *T*-7 and everything *T*-3 kept tract *-8 somewhere E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###and I do n't know , E_S 
168926:49	###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that was , \+ \[ that , \+ that \] was \] the other one 0 I was thinking of *T*-1 . E_S ###I think 0 that 's , uh , N_S ###I mean I know 0 drugs are illegal . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###It MUMBLEx thing actually . N_S ###Uh , I , uh , have worked at Texas Instruments . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Huh . Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
168933:47	###SpeakerA11 . ###Huh . Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###And , uh , they instituted a \[ drug policy there . \+ Drug testing policy \] where they randomly would test , uh , employees *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###and actually , * to tell you the truth , I really did not think much about it . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] had n't *?* , you know , E_S ###it really did n't relate to me . E_S 
168933:102	###SpeakerA11 . ###Huh . Uh-huh .

168942:7	###it really did n't relate to me . E_S ###But there were some things *ICH*-3 that people brought *T*-1 up like well what *T*-2 happens if \[ they , \+ they \] get a false positive , you know , what recourse do you have *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And , also , uh , uh , this is against the law for the government to do \[ this kind of thing , \+ this kind of big brother activity \] E_S ###and yet , uh , a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments , although they do n't admit to it , \[ it 's \+ actually , oh , a drug testing policy comes \] about as a result of government pressure . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
168948:173	###and yet , uh , a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments , although they do n't admit to it , \[ it 's \+ actually , oh , a drug testing policy comes \] about as a result of government pressure . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###So what that means *T*-1 is , to me , that really it 's the government that *T*-2 's requiring this , E_S ###although they do n't actually \[ e- , \+ execute \] it themselves , it 's really the government that MUMBLEx . N_S ###So , in that sense , \[ it , \+ at least , philosophically , it 's \] really borderline legal . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well \[ \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the , \+ I think that , \] you know , a person 's competence should be more determined *-1 by , you know , their actions and their behavior E_S 
168951:38	###SpeakerB18 . ###So what that means *T*-1 is , to me , that really it 's the government that *T*-2 's requiring this , E_S ###although they do n't actually \[ e- , \+ execute \] it themselves , it 's really the government that MUMBLEx .

E_S ###I think 0 they should be evaluated *-1 that way rather than with \[ a , \+ you know , a \] chemical , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
168972:54	###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah , \[ tha- , \+ that \] would be kind of an extreme . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Now , uh , you know if they ever , N_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###I mean I 've heard of things like , you know , * \[ making them , \+ you know , marking them \] somehow \[ or , \+ you know , or \] something like that or , you know , putting them all someplace like in a kind of , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###So what about that as an invasion of privacy ? E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S 
169004:22	###not a huge part but a , you know N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###A growing part . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###the AIDS population I guess that *T*-2 have it , that *T*-1 do n't know 0 they do are spreading it . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###But , again , * to require , you know , such a test \[ and jus- , \+ and then \] to \[ make , \+ make \] it MUMBLEx is * to subject them \[ to , \+ to \] \[ discrimi- , \+ discriminatory \] practices and other things . E_S ###I do n't know , E_S 
169025:43	###SpeakerA4 . ###Probably the most popular one but , uh , one that *T*-1 is not typically recognized *-2 as such is the Boy Scouts . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Uh , I know that \[ f- , \+ \] because my son is \[ a , \+ a \] scout now and , uh , is thinking about his Eagle E_S ###and , uh , in order * to get Eagle , you have *-1 to have merit badges in , uh , citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation , citizenship in the world E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . 
169056:16	###right . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###And , so , uh , one of the things that *T*-1 would fulfill \[ the , \+ at least the \] nominal , uh , qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Huh . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###Uh , E_S ###but I agree with you ,

169067:25	###There are other things such as civil service uh , which many people , uh , are lifelong employees of *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Well , i- , N_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###SpeakerB23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###SpeakerB25 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . 
169081:79	###SpeakerA28 . ###or , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S ###\[ i- , \+ i- , \] N_S ###\[ for , \+ for \] years there has been an idea *ICH*-2 batted * around of * having some sort of alternative , uh , public service 0 for , uh , young people to go into *T*-3 , uh , after high school .

170174:7	###\[ \[ I 'd , \+ I , \] \+ I \] kept *-1 bouncing checks , just at the end of the month E_S ###but \[ I , \+ I \] had miscalculated . E_S ###\[ I , \+ well I \] did n't keep a balance .

170256:26	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###I mean you buy \[ a , \+ a \] tenderloin steak , it costs outrageous , like twelve dollars a pound .

E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###A lot of , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
170312:124	###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh , and , uh , N_S ###so \[ \[ we 're , \+ we 're part , \] \+ we 're actually part \] of M I T .

170320:29	###Right .

170332:8	###Well those and probably the security aspect of it . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh .

170339:5	###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh .

170560:46	###SpeakerB47 . ###SpeakerA48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well I know 0 I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter E_S ###and my little one also competed because really she had no choice .

170630:8	###SpeakerA70 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###SpeakerA72 . ###That 's what I 've heard *T*-1 .

170754:21	###And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars E_S ###and then , uh , about a month later , a man was looking at my car E_S ###and he asked me , N_S you know , ###\[ not a man , \+ not a repair man , \] but just a friend E_S ###and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put *-1 on E_S ###and he looked at N_S ###and he said that 's not a new master cylinder E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
170771:6	###Uh , more than likely . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###* \[ Apparently just , uh , \[ re- , \+ re- , \] \+ uh , probably filled \] \[ the , \+ the \] brake fluid up E_S ###and that was it .

170825:13	###SpeakerA55 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###So \[ it was , \+ it was \] not good E_S ###and , uh . N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Do you know anyone that , uh , *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] in a nursing home or has ever been in one ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###No . E_S ###But \[ I , \+ my grandparents \] were looking into it before E_S 
170834:26	###But \[ I , \+ my grandparents \] were looking into it before E_S ###so I know what they 've said *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , I 'm trying *-1 to think . E_S ###My , uh , uh , wife 's grandmother had Alzheimer 's E_S ###and they were going *-1 to put her into \[ a , \+ a \] nursing home E_S 
170869:78	###there was a retirement hotel and then a , uh , N_S ###there was some sort of full-time care place that *T*-1 was also associated *-2 with it E_S ###so for , uh , the first few years she had her own apartment and , you know , made her own meals sometimes . But \[ could , \+ could \] also go and eat someplace else . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###And then , uh , as she became less able *-1 to take care of herself , then she moved into this other part that *T*-2 was able *-3 to , uh , provide full-time care E_S ###and , uh , she did n't have *-1 to do anything anymore . E_S ###But my experience has been that most people that *T*-1 move into nursing homes die very quickly . E_S ###And that 's som- , N_S 
170884:91	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###They need health care E_S ###so they 're already ill before they go . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###That 's probably a large factor . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S 
170893:11	###Yeah . E_S ###\[ If , \+ if \] you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that *T*-1 can take care of you , then you stay where you are *T*-2 . E_S ###Then you only go there as a last resort . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Or people send you there as a last resort . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S 
170899:8	###Or people send you there as a last resort . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###That 's what my grandparents , N_S ###it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind *-1 knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So that was their thinking . E_S 
170899:22	###Or people send you there as a last resort . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###That 's what my grandparents , N_S ###it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind *-1 knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So that was their thinking . E_S 
170903:109	###That 's what my grandparents , N_S ###it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind *-1 knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So that was their thinking . E_S ###Somebody who *T*-1 would know what * to do *T*-2 in the event of an emergency . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
170913:22	###And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed *T*-1 while they still had choices 0 * to make *T*-2 . So they would n't be stuck *-3 going into just whatever nursing home *T*-4 was available at the time . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###I guess 0 that 's a problem *ICH*-1 too for people . Wait lists and all . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###That , uh , N_S 
170917:6	###I guess 0 that 's a problem *ICH*-1 too for people . Wait lists and all . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###That , uh , N_S ###you ca n't always get in when you want *-1 too *?* *T*-2 E_S ###and of course , you ca n't just sit around and wait . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Right . E_S 
170922:29	###That , uh , N_S ###you ca n't always get in when you want *-1 too *?* *T*-2 E_S ###and of course , you ca n't just sit around and wait . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Right . E_S ###When you need it *T*-1 , you need it I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . 
170944:54	###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###So it 's another problem . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###And \[ you probably , \+ if it were you , you probably \] would n't want someone choosing a place 0 for you to live *T*-1 based on lowest price . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###So , \[ it , \+ it 's \] just so complicated anymore , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###People outlive their savings . E_S 
170948:58	###And \[ you probably , \+ if it were you , you probably \] would n't want someone choosing a place 0 for you to live *T*-1 based on lowest price . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###So , \[ it , \+ it 's \] just so complicated anymore , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###People outlive their savings . E_S ###And , with medicine being the way 0 it is *T*-1 , you 're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down *T*-2 E_S ###and they 're not necessarily enjoying life anymore . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S 
170969:74	###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 've known quite a few people that *T*-1 have , uh , gone to retirement communities . E_S ###I do n't know if they have them back there E_S ###but here in California and in Ari- , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Uh , I 've had , uh , three boys *ICH*-1 through , I guess , uh , some child care , each one of them E_S ###and now they 're in school E_S ###so it 's all over E_S 
170979:40	###but , uh , I guess 0 I would say 0 it *EXP*-1 's not easy * to find \[ wha- , \+ what \] most parents would want *T*-2 .

171279:43	###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I do n't know either . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###And they 're going *-1 to be really struggling E_S 
171297:23	###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's kind of scary . E_S ###Huh . Well that 's true . E_S ###But , I , N_S ###it 's just \[ very , \+ very \] different E_S ###and I guess 0 every ten years it 's just been very different . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA57 .

171830:11	###SpeakerA20 . ###Well , it depends on where *ICH*-2 you 're from *T*-1 in Texas . E_S ###I live right by Dallas ###so we have one football team as far as we 're concerned *-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###SpeakerB23 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . 
171946:23	###SpeakerA64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###Like they have this World Football League .

172098:39	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###so a judge , you 're right 0 *T*-1 , should have the whole dossier of the criminal there E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh .

172116:29	###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###In other words , \[ not , \+ not , \] N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . 
172123:35	###In other words , \[ not , \+ not , \] N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###there would be some types of crimes for which you 're not guaranteed *-1 a jury trial *T*-2 ?

172135:40	###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
172153:22	###SpeakerB30 . ###Oh , ###oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] did n't mean that , ###no .

E_S 
172207:26	###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Well , uh , in the case of , civil , uh , things , I think maybe \[ the , \+ the \] use of the jury is very , often to the lawyer 's advantage E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 .

174272:72	###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . ###It , N_S ###there would be much more of that . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah E_S ###no doubt . E_S ###Are you involved in the legal system at all ? E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###No . E_S 
174294:56	###so . N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###One of them just got his law degree .

174309:58	###SpeakerB46 . ###I 'm sure of it . E_S ###Because a lot of those things , \[ \[ it 's all , \+ it 's in , \] \+ it 's \] largely a matter of viewpoint .

174317:4	###Uh , it 's kind of weird . E_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###\[ you \+ I \] always think about *-1 watching the PEOPLE 'S COURT or something . And how weird those cases get *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . ###I know . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###It 's just , N_S ###SpeakerA55 . 
174336:32	###SpeakerA59 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###it 's pretty amazing . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###And it 's like \[ the , \+ the \] truth is n't really important anymore . E_S ###It 's , N_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's not . E_S 
174375:42	###SpeakerB76 . ###See , you 're from California , E_S ###is that right ? E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh , yeah . E_S ###Well originally from Chicago E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###I was just thinking E_S

174401:16	###Pretty strange . E_S ###But , uh , fortunately I never have had *-1 to go in \[ even , \+ even \] for jury duty . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I have n't *?* either other than , N_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###But , uh , that friend of mine 's telling me that I might have *-1 to go in \[ for , \+ uh , as \] a witness .

174405:19	###I have n't *?* either other than , N_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###But , uh , that friend of mine 's telling me that I might have *-1 to go in \[ for , \+ uh , as \] a witness . E_S ###He may subpoena me . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###SpeakerB90 . ###So we 'll see what *T*-1 happens . E_S ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah . E_S 
174437:18	###SpeakerB98 . ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I 'm \] originally from Florida E_S ###and \[ it 's like \+ it seems like \] every year they let out more and more just cause they do n't have room for them , you know .

174466:4	###\[ I 've al- , \+ I 've always , \] uh , \[ w- , \+ wanted \] very much , uh , *-1 to , uh , be somehow involved in all that .

E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Of course , I 've really wanted *-1 to actually manage *-2 to get into space someday . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###But , uh , that seems rather unlikely at this point , unfortunately . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . 
174482:41	###Unfortunately , that can be done *-1 from the ground . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###To bad , huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###* Made the \[ wrong , \+ wrong \] career choice *-1 to get up into space . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###The , uh , uh , N_S 
174491:16	###The , uh , uh , N_S ###I used *-1 to think \[ when I was , \+ when I was \] younger *T*-2 that , uh , by this time we 'd have lots more \[ in \+ \] stuff in space than we do now . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh , frustrating at times . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
174524:23	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh , because that 's a , uh , you know , \[ in \+ \] singularly renewable resource \[ that *T*-1 does n't do it , \+ that *T*-2 does n't require , \] uh , uh , any particularly nasty environment impact . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###And you can just get as much power as you need *?* up there . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . 
174529:28	###SpeakerB36 . ###And you can just get as much power as you need *?* up there . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###It 's just a matter of how big you build it *-2 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh , and , of course , the side effects of this is that you have *-1 to have , uh , lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no MUMBLEx things that I think 0 we should be doing *T*-2 . E_S 
174561:95	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###And they want *-1 to do the research E_S ###and uh , they 're all you know , nor- , N_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
174582:27	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###we should eventually send \[ someone , \+ people \] to Mars but not just because it *EXP*-1 's glitzy * to do so . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Right .

174603:11	###SpeakerA67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###\[ Now * let 's \+ now \] we 're done . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Now we 're done . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . ###No need * \[ to use this anymo- , \+ to play around with this space stuff anymore . \] E_S 
174614:4	###Uh , But , uh , I 'd give almost anything *-1 to get into space . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I think 0 you 're right . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###SpeakerA75 . ###I would *?* too . E_S ###\[ I 'd , \+ I 'd , \] uh , N_S ###was it John Denver \[ that \+ that \] *T*-1 tried *-2 to buy his way on to the space shuttle ? E_S ###SpeakerA1 .

E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###What do you think *T*-1 about capital punishment ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I 'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah . E_S 
174685:11	###I think 0 crime rates deterred *-1 a little bit by * using it E_S ###and , of course , you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money *-1 keeping people in jail or not . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###with Florida that 's a big problem because there 's so many people in jail that they have *-1 to let them out every year . E_S ###They , N_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S 
174705:77	###but there 's not a whole lot 0 you can do *T*-1 about it because there 's only so many jails 0 you can build *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###and \[ \[ it 's really , \+ you know , it 's , \] \+ it \] gets *-1 to be \[ a r- , \+ a big \] problem . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh , * go ahead . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . 
174705:95	###but there 's not a whole lot 0 you can do *T*-1 about it because there 's only so many jails 0 you can build *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh .

174717:15	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Be a little more , you know , N_S ###* not being able *T*-1 to put it off for fifteen years . N_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###Because a lot of these guys , you know , they get in E_S ###and \[ they , \+ they \] get off for good behavior E_S ###and , I do n't know , E_S 
174752:4	###but , I do n't know , E_S ###maybe MUMBLEx , N_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###\[ I , \+ yeah I \] tend *-1 to think 0 the repeal system for the death penalty is a \[ little , \+ little \] too lenient . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh , * kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
174758:4	###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh , * kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###What do you do *T*-1 Georgeanne ? E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###I 'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###Great . E_S 
174767:4	###Great . E_S ###What program you in *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh , audiology . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Okay . E_S ###Fantastic . ###Uh E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah . E_S 
174827:17	###Like the guy in California got thir- , you know , twice before he went to the gas chamber E_S ###and then they said okay , no , E_S ###you do n't have *-1 to go . E_S ###And then they took him back . E_S ###I mean , \[ it just seems , \+ Yeah , it just seemed \] a little inconsistent . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Jeez , E_S ###that 's a lot of repeals . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###And then you have like two , N_S 
174836:27	###And then you have like two , N_S ###you have these people who *T*-1 are serial killers that *T*-2 did n't even get the death sentence back when ever you know . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] trying *-1 to think about other crimes that *T*-2 would warrant it . E_S ###Uh , I guess , N_S 
174853:7	###so . N_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Or death before the firing squad or whatever . N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###So , I think 0 about the only one is , uh , rape , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
174870:4	###and \[ I went through \[ a , \+ a \] pretty , \+ I do n't know , I went through a , standard \] drug testing thing before \[ I , \+ I \] was brought *-1 on . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###I think 0 that 's pretty standard . E_S ###At least at Honeywell it is *?* . E_S ###Uh , I think 0 it 's important * to insure the quality \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , I do n't know , almost the goodness of character . You know that kind of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . 
174908:48	###Yeah . E_S ###And \[ that , \+ that \] definitely happens , you know . E_S ###I mean \[ those , \+ the \] drug tests , sure they 're accurate E_S ###but there 's always that margin of error . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] something 0 * to be aware of *T*-1 . E_S ###Another thing is , 0 a lot of times , you know , they are n't that accurate . E_S ###They are n't that sensitive . E_S 
174912:40	###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] something 0 * to be aware of *T*-1 . E_S ###Another thing is , 0 a lot of times , you know , they are n't that accurate . E_S ###They are n't that sensitive . E_S ###Like if you 're on a prescription drug of some kind , you know , what are they going *-1 to do *T*-2 about that . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
174922:16	###You know , I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested *-1 for Honeywell *T*-2 E_S ###and , uh , uh , you know , I know 0 they did n't catch that ###or else they would have said something . E_S ###Uh , I 'm sure 0 they screen for just a particular few types . E_S ###Although the literature 0 they give *T*-1 with you says yeah we do this E_S ###and then they list about five thousand drugs 0 they try *-1 to test for *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh , I do n't know . E_S 
174949:33	###They test you , uh , \[ before they , \+ before you \] start or before you even interview E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###or , N_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh , they essentially , N_S ###no E_S ###I sure do n't , uh , N_S ###\[ they essentially , \+ uh , they essentially , \] uh , made me the offer \[ and then , \+ and then , \] uh , did the drug testing thing after that . E_S 
174968:16	###So , uh , there 's some noise on this end . E_S ###I 'm actually in a mall *-1 calling E_S ###so N_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###You probably wondered , huh . E_S ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S 
174973:15	###SpeakerA43 . ###You probably wondered , huh . E_S ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ Wh- , \+ what \] *T*-1 happens if you were *-2 to fail ? E_S ###Then do they give you like \[ one ch- , \+ one more \] chance or two more chances ? E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yes . E_S ###That 's a good question . E_S 
174979:28	###Then do they give you like \[ one ch- , \+ one more \] chance or two more chances ? E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yes . E_S ###That 's a good question . E_S ###I believe from what *ICH*-2 I remember *T*-1 of the literature 0 they gave , uh , if you fail I believe they give you one more chance . E_S ###They probably give you a chance *-1 to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance *-2 to go through it . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###But , uh , you know , once again , those things are not that accurate E_S 
175007:22	###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###And he 's doing an internship with I B M . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Oh .

175026:48	###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 the unwritten rule is , yeah , * expect it E_S ###but they do n't do it . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###You know , so . That 's good I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###I mean , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] have gone to a couple of parties \[ since , \+ since \] that time E_S 
175042:4	###\[ they do n't , \+ they do n't \] really do that . E_S ###So . N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Wow . E_S ###Is it *EXP*-1 formal policy that they said 0 they might test ? E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###I 'm here . E_S 
175048:21	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###I 'm here . E_S ###How do you feel about public schools *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , our public schools \[ are , \+ are \] really poor , I feel 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 .

175071:56	###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###How about you ? E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Well , that 's interesting . E_S ###I have a sister who *T*-1 used *-2 to live in Kennesaw , Georgia . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
175133:4	###e- , N_S ###my husband and I go to the store E_S ###and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication , division things E_S ###and I feel like , uh , there are several areas that we 're just really , really slow in *T*-1 .

175156:7	###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . ###Perhaps . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###but more than that , I do n't think that they have the authority * to command the attention of the children . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . 
175204:69	###you do n't want *-1 to seem racist or prejudice or whatever , E_S ###but then again . N_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###But it is a problem .

177224:143	###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###And , of course , I 'm not perfectly happy about *-1 not having a job . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###So , how do you feel *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Well , I 'm a little bit ambivalent . E_S 
177256:4	###SpeakerA25 . ###And then the , third thing is , uh , the political aspect of , uh , uh , * letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . ###They can not close off the Mexican border .

177290:89	###Yeah , E_S ###well I know about it . E_S ###Uh , I mean \[ it 's , \+ it is \] now with Haitians the way 0 it was *T*-1 with Cubans , uh , twenty years ago .

177302:43	###But there 's some differences in the immigrants , \[ that , \+ that \] we 're getting *T*-1 now .

E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
177322:28	###and , uh , first of all , \[ th- , \+ they , \] N_S ###I 'm sorry , \[ this , \+ I really feel strongly about this . \] E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###We send a lot of money to Mexico . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###SpeakerA2 . 
177351:35	###Of course , uh , you being from New Mexico , you 've probably been \[ n- , \+ \] to Washington . Especially if you 're , your present location . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Yes .

177376:59	###SpeakerB17 . ###Well , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Uh , \[ other , \+ other \] than * nuking it . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Yes , E_S ###other than * nuking it . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###SpeakerB21 . ###Um , in fact , Los Alamos , uh , has , uh , done a fair amount of research , uh , in * recycling things in general . E_S 
177395:8	###SpeakerB27 . ###Uh , uh , they 've , uh , looked at , uh , plutonium and uranium and , uh , some other similar things *-2 to try *-1 to remove those from radio active waste E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Huh .

E_S ###Actually I 've been involved *-1 in recycling for long before it became fashionable . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###We- , N_S ###SpeakerB31 . 
177405:132	###Back when I was in graduate school *T*-1 , I did all of the recycling of the , uh , paper from the computer center E_S ###and , uh , in fact I think 0 I was the first person in our department 0 *T*-1 to have my thesis published *-2 on \[ recyclable pa- , \+ recycled paper . \] E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###SpeakerA34 . ###Well that 's certainly , uh , you know , uh , getting into the swim of things . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ it should be , \+ \[ i- , \+ it \] should go \] \[ to the , \+ to the \] heart of the matter though and say , okay guy , E_S ###\[ \[ you , \+ y- , \] \+ everybody \] gets , you know , five pounds of garbage that they can throw *T*-1 away , you know . E_S ###Uh , but more than that every week , uh , you 've got *-1 to pay by the pound . E_S 
177431:7	###Uh , \[ and , \+ uh , and \] * limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than * limiting the weight . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###Well , of course , \[ that , \+ uh , you know , those \] big trucks \[ \[ can , \+ can , \] \+ probably are \] far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor .

177489:29	###you obviously \[ are , \+ are \] not an exercise buff ###or else you 'd be out there *-1 doing it . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah .
