3:43	Uh , first , um , I need *-1 to know , uh , how do you feel *T*-2 \[ about , \+ uh , about \] * sending , uh , an elderly , uh , family member to a nursing home ? E_S
17:77	And , uh , \[ we were , \+ I was \] fortunate in that E_S I was personally acquainted with the , uh , people who , uh , *T*-1 ran the nursing home in our little hometown . E_S
21:45	So , I was very comfortable , you know , in *-1 doing it when it got to the point that we had *-2 to do it *T*-3 *T*-4 . E_S
23:31	well , I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who *T*-1 had fell and \[ needed * to be , \+ \] you know , could not take care of herself anymore , was confined *-2 to a nursing home for a while E_S
96:22	I mean , for somebody who *T*-1 \[ is , \+ \] you know , for most of their life \[ has , \+ has , \] uh , not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm , ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines . E_S
178:54	And , uh , fortunately , we agreed , you know , on exactly , you know , what we thought 0 *T*-1 should be done *-2 . E_S
184:104	We were lucky \[ in , that \+ in one \] respect in that after she had her stroke she was n't \[ really , \+ you know , really \] much aware of what *T*-1 was going on . E_S
214:17	And I think that when she passed away *T*-1 it was probably one of the greatest , N_S
225:95	I mean , \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I di- , \] \+ I \] do n't know \[ how I would , \+ how I would \] deal *T*-1 if one of my parents came \[ with , \+ with \] Alzheimer 's . or something like , that \[ which *T*-2 is , \+ which *T*-3 is \] far more devastating . E_S
225:194	I mean , \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I di- , \] \+ I \] do n't know \[ how I would , \+ how I would \] deal *T*-1 if one of my parents came \[ with , \+ with \] Alzheimer 's . or something like , that \[ which *T*-2 is , \+ which *T*-3 is \] far more devastating . E_S
257:120	\[ \[ I think , \+ I think , \] \+ I think , \] 0 you know for myself \[ I , \+ I \] see that as probably \[ the , \+ the , \] what everything would hinge upon *T*-1 . E_S
262:4	how close is it *T*-1 to a home environment . E_S
291:192	But , I guess 0 as we become more industrialized and more , you know , less in a rural situation \[ \[ \[ \[ we , \+ we do n't , \] \+ we , \] \+ we , \] \+ we \] choose *-1 not to deal with the , extended family because we feel 0 it 's kind of cumbersome , when in reality it makes things much much easier *T*-2 . E_S
331:188	But , uh , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think that , you know , \[ we always , \+ \] uh , I mean , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] had a lot of good experiences \[ with , \+ uh , with \] \[ many \+ many \] people especially where they 've had , uh , extended family *T*-1 . E_S
337:84	money seems *-1 to be too big of an issue . \[ \[ \[ With , \+ with , \] \+ with , \] \+ with \] what *T*-2 's going on today E_S
394:4	What did you wear *T*-1 to work today ? E_S
397:4	What did I wear *T*-1 to work today ? E_S
416:58	So I tend *-1 to get up in the morning , put on , sweats , um , do whatever I want *-2 to do *T*-3 with the kids ,
417:8	then whenever I have a meeting with a client *T*-4 , I 'll put a suit on . And then come home and get back into regular clothes again . E_S
429:52	Um , you know , there 's \[ real no , \+ no real \] dress code where I work *T*-1 . E_S
477:54	It *EXP*-2 's nice 0 you can wear shorts , especially on a day like today when it 's so hot *T*-1 . E_S
491:10	Um , where I work *T*-1 is predominantly male . E_S
630:19	I 'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
668:74	and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] tend *-1 to , I think 0 *T*-3 , overreact occasionally when somebody tells me 0 it 's that great *T*-2 . E_S
676:51	\[ \[ And , \+ and , \] \+ and \] I guess 0 that 's what I really like *T*-1 . E_S
719:13	do you know who he is *T*-1 ? E_S
749:26	I was listening Sunday night a little bit when , I was going *-1 to pick up my daughter *T*-2 . E_S
755:60	\[ the , \+ the \] difficulty \[ with , \+ with \] DANCING WITH WOLVES is that when you make a movie like that *T*-2 , and you produce it *T*-2 , and then you star in it *T*-2 , uh , the question is , \[ did he , \+ did he \] really know 0 it was going *-1 to be good E_S
770:13	Do you know who the guy *ICH*-3 was *T*-2 that *T*-1 was playing \[ \[ the , \+ uh , the , \] \+ the \] wagon driver ? E_S
775:21	You know , the guy when he first headed out from the army post *T*-1 . E_S
780:16	I do n't know who that guy is *T*-1 . E_S
830:16	I do n't know how long this conversation is supposed *-1 to go *T*-2 E_S
839:10	Is that what , it does *T*-1 ? E_S
844:4	Why do we end this thing *T*-1 ? E_S
850:17	but it says 0 when the conversation is over *T*-1 * just say your good-byes and hang up . E_S
853:4	Why do n't we do that *T*-1 ? E_S
861:80	Well , the first thing for me is \[ I wonder , \+ I see \] a couple of different ways of * talking about what privacy is *T*-1 ,
865:34	but in the second time , at least overtly , uh , where someone comes in and , uh , finds out information about you that *T*-1 should be private *T*-2 , uh , does not seem , uh , um , obviously , everyday . E_S
868:55	I think 0 in a good example on the typical thing that *T*-1 happens , uh , when the phone rang *T*-2 E_S and it 's T I 0 *T*-3 calling , E_S my immediate reaction is that it 's some sort of strange phone message E_S
885:97	Uh , and at the same time I think that I receive \[ on , \+ on \] the order of , uh , probably , seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way 0 *-2 to just hang up on it *T*-1 *T*-3 . E_S
896:66	Um , because I 'm usually so insulted by them 0 I just hang up as soon as I recognize what , they are *T*-1 . E_S
901:45	I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has *T*-1 0 *-3 to say *T*-2 , E_S
904:24	And I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems *-2 to be little control E_S
926:17	Well , presumably those who *T*-1 find out such information , if they are doing it , I would prefer *-2 to not to be known *-3 , E_S
928:47	So there 's , , things that *T*-1 invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them *T*-2 and possibly things that *T*-3 invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it , E_S
937:61	Well , I guess , 0 although , \[ I , \+ \] well , that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is *T*-1 *T*-3 *T*-2 , because , uh , if that 's the case of a tree falling in the forest E_S
937:75	Well , I guess , 0 although , \[ I , \+ \] well , that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is *T*-1 *T*-3 *T*-2 , because , uh , if that 's the case of a tree falling in the forest E_S
937:88	Well , I guess , 0 although , \[ I , \+ \] well , that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is *T*-1 *T*-3 *T*-2 , because , uh , if that 's the case of a tree falling in the forest E_S
984:32	I was just about *-1 to write a letter when I heard 0 they canceled it *T*-2 . E_S
986:20	That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high *T*-1 because I would find that there be , \[ cou- , \+ \] a good possibly that their facts \[ were , \+ were \] fantasy . E_S
1008:13	And the person who *T*-1 had *?* takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money N_S
1020:68	And , um , one of the problems with the Lotus data base was , um , that it was uncontrolled access to who *T*-1 would have that information . E_S
1028:43	and they would n't bother *-1 to check that carefully anyway to someone who *T*-2 's offering , you know , full cash price , for it . E_S
1032:41	I mean , you know , you ca n't tell it , what a company really has *-1 to do *T*-2 with it E_S
1033:62	and there 's something rather ominous about * having virtually anyone , any hacker being able *-1 to know what your income is *T*-2 , what your spending habits are *T*-3 , E_S
1033:80	and there 's something rather ominous about * having virtually anyone , any hacker being able *-1 to know what your income is *T*-2 , what your spending habits are *T*-3 , E_S
1035:25	and suddenly \[ and then \+ \] what *T*-1 started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home . E_S
1042:44	so , maybe that is \[ a , \+ a \] little bit of what privacy is *T*-1 . E_S
1049:139	I also thought about it , \[ was of , \+ \] uh , *-1 waiting *-2 to talk to you that , another thing that *T*-4 occurred to me is 0 there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how *-5 to behave *T*-6 such that there is n't *?* . E_S
1064:40	Loneliness *ICH*-2 is the closest 0 you can come *T*-1 , which *T*-3 is really quite different . E_S
1095:16	Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much *T*-1 , if you go out and then act like the lunatic \[ you , \+ you \] violate \[ the , \+ uh , the \] norms \[ of social , \+ of , um , public \] behavior . E_S
1097:91	and they start *-1 asking questions and in the sense are \[ \[ invite- , \+ invade , \] \+ invading \] your privacy although , if you know what the social norms are *T*-2 , you know , quote unquote , you asked for it . E_S
1102:16	\[ And \+ \] which *T*-1 is n't \[ of , \+ \] always the case in all cultures , E_S
1107:75	\[ and , \+ and \] that it *EXP*-2 's fascinating * \[ to , \+ to \] think a lot of someone who *T*-1 does n't know how *-3 to say private *T*-4 . E_S
1107:91	\[ and , \+ and \] that it *EXP*-2 's fascinating * \[ to , \+ to \] think a lot of someone who *T*-1 does n't know how *-3 to say private *T*-4 . E_S
1112:41	well , I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] wonder how people have sex *T*-1 , and things like that , E_S
1121:64	for al- , N_S of the time 0 I 've spent *T*-1 there , I still do n't quite understand how certain things that I assume 0 *T*-2 and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy *T*-3 . E_S
1126:22	but for me a lot of what I do *T*-1 requires a sense that there 's this invisible barrier around me which people \[ wil- , \+ will \] respect *T*-2 . E_S
1126:68	but for me a lot of what I do *T*-1 requires a sense that there 's this invisible barrier around me which people \[ wil- , \+ will \] respect *T*-2 . E_S
1130:56	And if that 's gone , um , \[ I , \+ I \] really do n't know how *-1 to live *T*-2 very well , E_S
1131:38	and \[ I wonder , \+ I really do wonder \] how people do that *T*-1 . E_S
1134:88	\[ Are th- , \+ are there \] any other specific things \[ \[ that , \+ that \] you feel like , \+ \[ where , \+ where \] you feel \] your privacy to be invaded *-1 on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency *T*-2 ? E_S
1136:91	All \[ the class- , \+ the other classic \] examples , the Jehovah 's Witness \[ or , \+ or \] Mormons or someone knocking at the front door , um , which *T*-1 is more intrusive because I have *-2 to really tell someone *-3 to go away . E_S
1138:15	they now see what I look like *T*-1 , what I live like *T*-2 E_S
1138:34	they now see what I look like *T*-1 , what I live like *T*-2 E_S
1152:10	and normally when they call *T*-1 , you 're either in the shower , E_S
1187:30	\[ so , \+ and \] I hate that when I 've got a whole bunch of messages *T*-1 E_S
1200:37	and I think 0 a law should be passed *-1 to where any of these people , N_S
1226:12	So , usually what I do *T*-1 is 0 I 'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey , there 's people coming around , you know , E_S
1233:16	It was n't even what I would consider *T*-1 , you know , family hours , E_S
1261:17	Now the part about where you said 0 the apartment complex puts up signs that *T*-1 says no soliciting *T*-2 , E_S
1265:17	I do n't know how much clearer it can be *T*-1 , E_S
1311:16	I ca n't remember what it was *T*-1 , E_S
1390:27	I know because , I know 0 when my mother was \[ a , \+ \] you know , going into the work force *T*-1 there was n't very many opportunities for her , I guess , E_S
1396:47	I think 0 \[ no- , \+ now , \] you go to work when they 're six weeks old , you know *T*-1 , E_S
1447:7	not what color you are *T*-1 , how old you are *T*-2 , what you 're male or female . E_S
1447:25	not what color you are *T*-1 , how old you are *T*-2 , what you 're male or female . E_S
1486:28	As a matter of fact , that 's what I 'm doing *T*-1 . E_S
1497:75	Or , a lot of women 0 I know now *T*-1 and \[ my , \+ uh , one of my \] supervisors , when she went on L O A *-2 to have her baby *T*-3 , we hooked up , uh , uh , a terminal at her house E_S
1586:15	you know , when that subject comes up *T*-1 they can say yes , E_S
1601:9	or , what I 've done *T*-1 is * found like doctors ' and dentists ' office with extended hours . E_S
1609:16	I do n't know how many times I 've done that *T*-1 *-2 to do something , post office or the bank or any kind of errand , E_S
1639:33	I think 0 there is still some discrimination there where \[ as , \+ \] you know , men and women work in the same job *T*-1 , E_S
1677:49	\[ \[ what , \+ now , uh , what \] particularly , \+ particularly what \] kind of music do you like *T*-1 ? E_S
1681:53	so , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-1 to be one of those people who *T*-2 switches stations a lot because I do n't like commercials . E_S
1721:4	How do you feel *T*-1 about rap music ? E_S
1730:60	the one thing 0 I do object to *T*-1 about rap music \[ is , \+ is \] when it becomes militant *T*-2 , or , if it 's , uh , violence oriented . E_S
1741:4	When it was really just starting *T*-1 . E_S
1745:5	when it was just starting *T*-1 , I heard what *T*-2 was called *-3 talking blues , which *T*-4 actually is rap . E_S
1745:33	when it was just starting *T*-1 , I heard what *T*-2 was called *-3 talking blues , which *T*-4 actually is rap . E_S
1745:59	when it was just starting *T*-1 , I heard what *T*-2 was called *-3 talking blues , which *T*-4 actually is rap . E_S
1772:44	and yet , \[ I , \+ I \] have a much younger sister who *T*-1 listens to a lot of rap music E_S
1773:39	and , uh , she thinks 0 it *EXP*-3 's pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she 's listening to *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
1792:73	I guess 0 there was even \[ a , \+ a \] bit of ruckus caused * by the M C Hammer , who *T*-1 's really , you know , E_S
1803:16	I ca n't remember who the artist was *T*-1 on that . E_S
1850:10	and then when you hear the cover *T*-1 it 's like , you know , God , what are they doing *T*-2 . E_S
1850:55	and then when you hear the cover *T*-1 it 's like , you know , God , what are they doing *T*-2 . E_S
1872:16	but you know , whatever *T*-1 became of Peter Frampton . E_S
1877:36	I remember , 0 I saw him in a concert , when I was , N_S
1886:18	I think that probably what *T*-1 did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer . E_S
1895:25	Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like *T*-1 . E_S
1915:40	and I 'm like , you know , you do n't know what you 're talking about *T*-1 . E_S
1931:26	I guess 0 our age is showing when , \[ we , \+ we \] think that *T*-1 . E_S
1939:81	I saw some promise , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] a lot of the new wave , \[ when it , \+ when it \] came out , uh , back in the mid and early eighties *T*-1 . E_S
1946:71	I mean , I like , you know , \[ things \+ \] like *-1 to hear , you know , what they call *T*-2 world music . Which *T*-3 is , you know , * using all these natural forms of music E_S
1946:94	I mean , I like , you know , \[ things \+ \] like *-1 to hear , you know , what they call *T*-2 world music . Which *T*-3 is , you know , * using all these natural forms of music E_S
1959:21	But , \[ what , \+ what \] Paul Simon 's doing *T*-1 , I think 0 *T*-5 \[ \[ is , \+ is , \] \+ is \] great because he 's , you know \[ \[ I think , \+ I think \] that \+ \] using , I guess 0 what they call *T*-2 it is *RNR*-3 eclectic , you know . *-4 drawing from a lot of different sources and making , you know , a synthesis of a new type of music .
1965:4	What do you mean *T*-1 by world music ? E_S
1968:54	\[ a lot of the , \+ a lot of \] \[ where they , \+ where they \] make music that they adapt *T*-1 \[ \[ to a , \+ to another kind of , \] \+ to another type of \] listener *T*-2 . E_S
1977:12	And , then when they hear it *T*-1 , \[ \[ it , \+ it 's a really , \] \+ it 's \] another form of music ,
2004:15	I mean , when you listen to it *T*-1 , it 's um , uh , N_S
2027:30	and then he 's playing with Robbie Shoncar , who *T*-1 's a very good , N_S
2042:20	but , I mean , when I heard his album *T*-1 , I heard it and it was just incredible . E_S
2066:82	and I made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year *-2 using all of \[ our , \+ our \] checkbook *-3 to figure out what we spent *T*-1 each time and whether we were over or under for each month E_S
2067:19	and then basically since then what I 've done *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] * keep track of it through the checkbook E_S
2068:70	so that based on \[ whatever we 've got *T*-1 coming in , \+ the check coming in , \] then how much I 'm spending *T*-2 each half of the month and then * trying *-3 to also spe- , N_S
2084:4	What do you all do *T*-1 ? E_S
2086:47	Uh , \[ we 've , \+ we 've , \] uh , taken how much we have *T*-2 , you know , write down how much we have *T*-1 coming in each month E_S
2086:82	Uh , \[ we 've , \+ we 've , \] uh , taken how much we have *T*-2 , you know , write down how much we have *T*-1 coming in each month E_S
2088:38	at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend *T*-1 . E_S
2092:46	and at the end of the month we tally it up *-1 to see how close we , you know N_S
2153:4	What are you all trying *-1 to do *T*-2 long term . E_S
2166:8	mostly what \[ \[ we 're doing , \+ we 've worked , \] \+ we 've done \] *T*-2 the , uh , CODA account with T I where \[ they , \+ we \] put in so much a month *T*-1 , E_S
2166:92	mostly what \[ \[ we 're doing , \+ we 've worked , \] \+ we 've done \] *T*-2 the , uh , CODA account with T I where \[ they , \+ we \] put in so much a month *T*-1 , E_S
2172:11	that 's what we 're doing *T*-1 . E_S
2177:5	when I retired from there , or left *T*-1 , I took the money \[ 0 I \+ that I \] had *T*-2 in mine and put it in an I R A E_S
2187:8	when ever we get enough saved * *T*-1 we stick it in a C D for a while E_S
2194:80	and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and , uh , \[ what we were pla- , \+ \[ what , \+ what \] our , uh , goals were *T*-1 \] on a long term budget in terms of retirement , kids college , * paying off the house , * buying a different house , um , special thing , * buying land and building our own house E_S
2198:36	and they did an analysis *ICH*-4 for us based on what we were putting *T*-1 in and the time frame that we wanted *-2 to look at *T*-3 , and then gave us \[ a good idea back , \+ you know , some good information *ICH*-6 back \] on whether or not we were going *-5 to achieve those goals , \[ and , \+ or \] not , and what we needed *-7 to do *T*-8 so that we could achieve them and the money 0 we could put *T*-9 in at what time . E_S
2198:215	and they did an analysis *ICH*-4 for us based on what we were putting *T*-1 in and the time frame that we wanted *-2 to look at *T*-3 , and then gave us \[ a good idea back , \+ you know , some good information *ICH*-6 back \] on whether or not we were going *-5 to achieve those goals , \[ and , \+ or \] not , and what we needed *-7 to do *T*-8 so that we could achieve them and the money 0 we could put *T*-9 in at what time . E_S
2212:50	and he 's \[ set up , \+ uh , you know , determined \] how much \[ we need *-1 to , \+ you know , we need *T*-3 if \] something were *-2 to happen . E_S
2215:139	\[ that , \+ that 's \] the other financial thing 0 I guess that we 've done *T*-1 is with our life insurance is , since I 'm at home now \[ is , \+ is \] * figuring out , uh , what we would need *T*-2 if something happened to my husband , or what he would need *T*-3 if something happened to me , E_S

2224:28	so you know , I do n't know what he would do *T*-1 . E_S
2249:10	Uh , what kind of books do you enjoy *-1 reading *T*-2 ? E_S
2253:42	Um , I get a charge out of , uh , TEXAS HIGHWAY , which *T*-1 is , uh , very colorful ,
2312:22	It talks about , uh , who the customer is *T*-1 and * being customer oriented , uh , which *T*-2 falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments . E_S
2312:60	It talks about , uh , who the customer is *T*-1 and * being customer oriented , uh , which *T*-2 falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments . E_S
2316:69	Uh , one of its great slogans is 0 if you 're not serving the customer , you better be serving someone who *T*-1 is *?* . E_S
2320:44	Uh , so that 's all in self improvement * to stay focused on who the customer is *T*-1 E_S
2326:211	Um , every now and then I 'm loaned *-3 a tape 0 I can stick *T*-1 \[ in the , \+ uh , in the \] car cassette set on the way home * to make the drive more enjoyable , talking about , uh , better outlooks on things and the philosophy \[ of , \+ of \] Pat Hagerty and these kind of , uh , mind stimulating philosophy type . Which *T*-2 all , you know , betters yourself . E_S
2344:34	but , uh , they would be things on like how * to be successful *T*-1 and sort of * talking to yourself . You know \[ ge- , \+ getting \] \[ your , \+ yourself \] in gear * to , uh , sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want *-2 to do *T*-3 .

2350:37	How about items like , um , THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER , which *T*-1 used *-2 to be a big , N_S
2359:51	Um , our supervisor , uh , subtly bought all of us a book called * WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW *T*-1 . By a \[ man , \+ man \] named * Doctor Bittel , B I T T E L E_S
2364:61	And the very last chapter , and I have n't figured out why that one was last *T*-2 , is how * to manage engineers *T*-1 . E_S
2392:92	Well I guess 0 I also have been reading , uh , a lot of things on , uh , quality improvement and that type of thing because that 's what I 'm involved in *T*-1 a lot at work . E_S
2405:130	Yeah , \[ \[ we , \+ we have , \] \+ I think 0 \[ we , \+ we \] name \] drop it a little too much \[ and , \+ and \] do n't fully understand \[ what , \+ what \] it is *T*-1 0 we 're saying . E_S
2437:7	but where I am *T*-1 we have \[ a \+ like an \] extremely lax dress policy at work E_S
2446:39	We want *-1 to go ahead and let them do what ever they want *T*-2 . E_S
2451:7	and where we are *T*-1 now , what we 're doing *T*-2 is some very big lawsuits that *T*-3 happen *-4 to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents . E_S
2451:26	and where we are *T*-1 now , what we 're doing *T*-2 is some very big lawsuits that *T*-3 happen *-4 to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents . E_S
2457:44	and I ca n't see *-1 getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have *-2 to carry , you know , boxes of documents around *T*-3 , E_S
2459:38	But if we 're going *-1 to have a meeting , where we 're having the attorneys *ICH*-2 come in , or \[ people from , \+ uh , other party 's attorneys \] and stuff *T*-3 , then I normally dress up . E_S
2468:27	I know , you know , 0 where I am *T*-1 we work a lot with the customers E_S
2488:5	when , uh , I was at T I *T*-1 the first year or so , we were sent out to our record retention facility *-2 to look through two thousand boxes . E_S
2511:25	and , you know , this area where record retention is *T*-1 , there 's only a few people that *T*-2 work there , E_S
2512:34	and \[ he , sho- , \+ he \] knew who *T*-1 worked there , E_S
2515:18	and he just said , who 's your supervisor *T*-1 . E_S
2541:17	I do n't care what else you call them *T*-1 , you know , E_S
2566:82	the management does n't ever seem *-1 to want *-2 to take an , cut off , you know , that no , E_S this is wear we 're going *-3 to draw the line *T*-4 . E_S
2594:16	I do n't care what you say *T*-1 , E_S
2606:17	I had a friend who *T*-1 worked there for a year or so E_S
2623:5	When I was looking at her materials *T*-1 when she first started , you know , *T*-2 she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff . E_S
2623:30	When I was looking at her materials *T*-1 when she first started , you know , *T*-2 she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff . E_S
2646:18	but I am more productive when I 'm in pants *T*-1 . E_S
2651:30	I get things done * faster , than when I 'm in a dress and heels *T*-1 , you know , E_S
2710:42	And then there 's another one \[ who *T*-1 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] a little younger and a little more yuppish E_S
2730:59	but , I think 0 a lot of times \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] mainly who they 're going *-1 to meet with *T*-2 , E_S
2731:78	or they 're meeting with people that they know 0 *T*-2 is going *-3 to be dressed *-4 that way then that 's how they are *T*-1 . E_S
2735:140	If they 're just going *-1 to be meeting with T I -ers like * to talk about a patent kind of thing and \[ the , \+ they 're \] engineers that they 're talking too *T*-2 , they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed *T*-3 E_S
2743:15	\[ if \+ when they 're meeting with the engineers who they know 0 *T*-1 are going *-4 to be dressed down *T*-5 , if \] they come in , in , you know , a six hundred dollar three piece suit , it 's going *-2 to make the people 0 they 're meeting with *T*-3 feel very uncomfortable , you know , E_S
2743:38	\[ if \+ when they 're meeting with the engineers who they know 0 *T*-1 are going *-4 to be dressed down *T*-5 , if \] they come in , in , you know , a six hundred dollar three piece suit , it 's going *-2 to make the people 0 they 're meeting with *T*-3 feel very uncomfortable , you know , E_S
2751:12	I wonder what kind of money does he make *T*-1 , E_S
2786:4	How has it been *T*-1 this week for you ? E_S
2798:38	\[ We have , \+ we have \] gone through , what *T*-1 might be called *-2 the four seasons , uh , in the last week . E_S
2805:37	Well , I do n't even want *-1 to tell you what ours has been like *T*-2 then . E_S
2846:34	the blue flu , or the white collar flu , depending on where you work *T*-1 , I guess . E_S
2923:19	Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour *T*-1 . Summer and winter , E_S
2936:24	Oh , \[ rea- , \+ \] where *ICH*-2 did you go to school in Indiana *T*-1 ? E_S
3001:46	So , I had *-1 to call Jack Godfrey today *-2 to ask him what it was *T*-3 , because \[ I , \+ I \] had *-4 to abort the call last evening because I could n't get on the line . E_S
3006:16	I 'm not sure how long we 're supposed *-1 to talk *T*-2 . E_S
3045:29	\[ I , \+ I \] was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though *T*-1 . E_S
3057:42	And , I know the reason \[ why this is , \+ why \[ the , \+ uh , this \] is \] being gathered *-1 *T*-2 and the program and so forth , E_S
3066:21	I know 0 that 's what we 're supposed *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
3075:101	and I always thought 0 it *EXP*-3 's not necessary * to measure your time , just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation , \[ and , \+ and , \] end it when * needed *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
3115:29	I have a , uh , uh , friend who *T*-1 is a planner . Uh , a city planner . E_S
3143:5	What we do *T*-1 , we have a weather station , that we get all of this information , you know , temperature , wind speed , wind direction *T*-2 , E_S
3159:92	Oh , I guess the stuff that *T*-1 was done *-2 more in the seventies , because \[ that 's , \+ Well , no that 's \] really when I grew up *T*-3 , E_S
3164:17	so that 's really what I like *T*-1 better , E_S is that kind of music , E_S
3194:24	I went to their concert last year when they were here *T*-1 . E_S
3196:36	Oh , \[ that 's when , \+ that 's when \] they \[ took , \+ toured *T*-1 . \] E_S
3208:19	and I was n't sure what kind of music . E_S
3215:17	\[ What , \+ what \] kind of heavy metal are we talking about *T*-1 ? E_S
3218:34	We 're talking about \[ what they , \+ what they \] call *T*-1 hard rock . E_S
3251:42	I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 when you say heavy metal *T*-1 , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] thinking about like Cinderella , you know . E_S
3261:22	It 's like brash metal , which all 0 they do *T*-1 is 0 like , they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar *T*-2 , E_S
3268:9	and , what *T*-1 happens is like , oh , everybody gets like totally into the music E_S
3282:7	and what you do *T*-1 is , 0 you also try *-2 to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people . E_S
3291:34	But , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] what they do *T*-1 . E_S
3292:30	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] what some people call like *T*-1 really heavy metal . E_S
3317:10	is that what you said *T*-1 ? E_S
3332:19	because Queen was real popular when I was growing up *T*-1 . E_S
3372:49	but \[ I , \+ I \] would n't buy it . E_S Because see , what *T*-1 happens is , the old , see whe- , N_S
3384:58	\[ The , \+ the \] new stuff 's kind of more like , today 's rock and roll , which I , do n't really care for *T*-1 today 's rock and roll too much . E_S
3399:26	\[ And , \+ and , then \] what *T*-1 happened was that Phil Collins said , hey I can make money , a lot of money *-2 doing this , E_S
3417:63	and now you 're singing all this stuff that , *T*-3 does n't matter \[ what you , \+ what you \] sing *T*-2 or what you record *T*-1 , E_S
3417:82	and now you 're singing all this stuff that , *T*-3 does n't matter \[ what you , \+ what you \] sing *T*-2 or what you record *T*-1 , E_S
3419:37	And so , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] what *T*-1 gets me mad . E_S
3431:14	I saw it when it opened *T*-1 . E_S
3477:32	\[ I , \+ I \] never found out what a lot of the seventies music had *T*-1 too . E_S
3525:27	\[ So , \+ so \] that 's what I mean *T*-1 , E_S
3540:21	the seventies I do n't know what they 're called *-1 *T*-2 , you know , E_S
3562:4	what is it *T*-1
3571:65	Well , from now on we 're going *-1 to go \[ from the , \+ from nineteen sixty-nine \] when they took the first step on the moon *T*-2 , to nineteen eighties . E_S
3573:4	what *T*-1 happened in the middle ? E_S
3584:34	And , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] why I guess , everybody , N_S
3609:19	Uh \[ what , \+ what \] are you doing *T*-1 ? E_S
3667:24	and , uh , you know , whenever \[ \[ we , \+ he , \] \+ my \] husband has time off or something *T*-1 , we take them to the zoo , E_S
3692:178	\[ we have , \+ we try \] *-2 to spend like Monday nights , we call it family home evening , and , \[ have our kids , \+ uh , you know , have little lessons with them , \] and , you know , just \[ \[ see , \+ count , \] \+ see \] how things are going *T*-3 in our family and , you know , teach them about their grandparents or something like that . Bring out pictures of them so they get *-4 to know them E_S
3720:36	\[ That 's wha- , \+ yeah , that 's what \] we mostly do *T*-1 , pretty simple things . E_S
3728:41	\[ She , \+ she 's \] really getting to the age where she 's playing , and likes *-1 to go places *T*-2 . E_S
3778:37	\[ I , is , \+ I 'm \] not sure which one we went into *T*-1 , E_S
3779:29	it was about a year or so ago , when we went *T*-1 . E_S
3796:4	Where 's that *T*-1 . E_S
3903:60	but I feel almost ashamed *-1 to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who *T*-2 likes it . E_S
3926:10	Is that what you 're referring to *T*-1 ? E_S
3939:21	well that 's the reason why I like both of those programs *T*-1 is because they 're kind of based on books . E_S
3951:5	what I do watch *T*-1 is , uh , usually news and whatever *T*-2 is on public television . E_S
3951:41	what I do watch *T*-1 is , uh , usually news and whatever *T*-2 is on public television . E_S
4045:9	Oh , what 's that about *T*-1 ? E_S
4069:11	that 's why I say , did you stay up late *-2 to watch this RED DWARF *T*-1 . E_S
4094:16	\[ What , \+ what \] do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
4095:5	What kind of work do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
4103:17	I have a friend who *T*-1 works for T I E_S
4111:18	Well the last two people who *T*-1 have called , both worked for T I E_S
4134:4	How did you hear , N_S
4140:4	How did I hear about it *T*-1 ? E_S
4150:42	So \[ I , \+ I \] know the people at T I who *T*-1 are doing this E_S
4174:35	Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 what they are trying *-1 to say *T*-2 , is that there is a great deal of historical truth , E_S but 0 the interpretation that *T*-1 actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh , after the what , uh , \[ was \+ is \] it *T*-2 the King James Version when the committee \[ did it , \+ wrote the translation *T*-4 , \] that so much was lost *-3 in the translation , particularly since most of the translations were in Greek . E_S
4185:66	So , \[ in , \+ \] as to those types of interpretations , uh , really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now *T*-1 , and what it 's at *T*-2 . E_S
4185:95	So , \[ in , \+ \] as to those types of interpretations , uh , really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now *T*-1 , and what it 's at *T*-2 . E_S
4195:28	So , you know , it depends on how you look at it *T*-1 . E_S
4216:76	But , uh , \[ as , \+ as \] far as that goes , \[ I , \+ we \] at least agree on what we enjoy *T*-1 . E_S
4243:12	Uh , well how is it *EXP*-1 appropriate * to be talking about exercise attitudes *T*-2 ? . E_S
4255:5	how I met him *T*-3 was through , uh , the aerobics class that he used *-1 to teach *T*-2 . E_S
4270:11	So , and how do you feel about it *T*-1 ? . E_S
4272:41	Uh , \[ I 'm , \+ I am \] a person who *T*-1 wishes 0 I had more time 0 * to exercise *T*-2 . E_S
4310:37	\[ and , \+ and , \] she does n't enjoy it when it 's a chore *T*-1 . E_S
4323:81	\[ \[ or , \+ but , \] \+ but \] \[ I do try and , \+ um , I do try and \] regulate how much exercise I get *T*-1 a week . E_S
4331:10	Is that why you like aerobics classes *T*-1 , because \[ you 're not , sort of , \+ \] someone else is doing the counting for you , so , it makes it less of a chore ? E_S
4403:16	so I love it when , you know , it 's swimming weather *T*-1 , E_S
4409:33	Well , you 're talking to someone from California where it 's often swimming weather *T*-1 . E_S
4444:16	I do n't know where they actually started *T*-1 , E_S
4449:19	but , the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere *T*-1 . E_S
4477:96	And , uh , oh \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] \[ uni- , \+ University \] of California at Berkeley puts out THE WELLNESS LETTER . Which *T*-1 \[ is , \+ \] uh , turned into a fairly well subscribed to , uh , newsletter , monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that E_S
4502:30	but I could n't say \[ which , \+ which \] *T*-1 caused the other . E_S
4531:36	and more and more people start *-2 believing them or wondering how * to combine them with other things *T*-1 , E_S
4576:29	like I know a little bit about people who *T*-1 were considered *-2 very healthy in China E_S
4615:4	What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S
4678:65	but , um , it 's very frustrating . And , \[ even , \+ even \] with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or , uh , organic , you know , materials , and foods and things *T*-1 . E_S
4698:4	Where is that *T*-1 ? E_S
4715:11	You know where Saint Joe is *T*-1 ? E_S
4727:16	and you know , what *T*-1 frightens me , is that , you put a half a million people *ICH*-2 out in the middle of the desert with high tech weaponry , you know , E_S
4787:18	And , you know , who *T*-1 's *-2 to put the limit on it ? E_S
4849:15	because * look how many years they 've been doing that *T*-1 E_S
4894:26	Because , you know , we are what we teach *T*-1 . E_S
4898:14	Because that 's what our society becomes *T*-1 . E_S
4904:92	\[ \[ and I 've , \+ and I 've , \] \+ I 've \] lived in \[ that , \+ that \] environment for quite a few years when I was doing construction work *T*-1 . E_S
4911:7	and when they run out of money *T*-1 , they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money , E_S
4951:49	And , \[ I just , \+ I 'm just \] totally aghast at a what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
4959:7	astonishing what the younger ages know *T*-1 , E_S
4960:16	and they react to what they see *T*-1 at home . You know . E_S
4964:33	If they see violence at home , that 's what you 're going *-1 to get *T*-2 from the kids at school . E_S
4972:25	* Used *-1 to be 0 when you had a personality conflict *T*-2 \[ you just , \+ you \] worked with it E_S
4978:7	or what *T*-1 's even worse , is 0 they promote them into a position that they ca n't handle *T*-3 and let them get fired *-2 . E_S
4990:199	And one of the things that *T*-1 's in their culture that I really think 0 the major corporations should pay attention to *T*-2 , is the fact that , while Japan was becoming a great power , financially , the people that *T*-3 worked for those companies , worked for the same company 0 they worked for *T*-4 at sixty-five , as they did when they were eighteen *T*-5 . E_S
5013:48	But , you know , her preference is *-1 to be in an office situation where her job is ... N_S
5015:10	Um , what kind of hobbies do you have *T*-1 ? E_S
5017:34	Um , I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting , when I do have spare time *T*-1 . E_S
5042:13	and he says how do you get that from there to the material *T*-1 . E_S
5094:42	\[ I just , \+ I just \] keep an inventory of what I currently have *T*-1 , E_S
5095:10	and then when I start a new project *T*-1 , I go through and see \[ if I , \+ if I , \] you know , N_S
5096:37	* just buy the colors that I need *T*-1 of what I 'm low on *T*-2 . E_S
5103:59	Well , now can I improvise with * adding and using another color *ICH*-2 instead , you know , what *T*-1 comes close . Because a lot of them are similar . E_S
5244:13	and she said how did you know 0 those are the colors 0 we used *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
5301:36	The topic is * to discuss the , uh , sources where I receive news *T*-1 . E_S
5313:9	Well , why was C N N the only , N_S
5323:36	I guess , uh , 0 I do n't even know why I watched C N N *T*-1 . E_S
5329:14	I mean , what 's the other one *T*-1 , uh ,
5347:82	And all this week they have been having \[ this , \+ uh , a \] discussion about 0 that is \[ why , \+ uh , why \] C N N was N_S
5355:33	you ca n't really be sure of the quality of what you 've got *T*-1 , you know . E_S
5370:44	and so it really made me question as to \[ what , \+ how \] do we know , you know , uh , if the news 0 we 're getting *T*-2 is any good *T*-1 . E_S
5374:73	I guess , 0 the news just focuses on major events that *T*-1 probably , do n't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who *T*-2 are right there when the news is being made *-3 *T*-4 . E_S
5374:89	I guess , 0 the news just focuses on major events that *T*-1 probably , do n't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who *T*-2 are right there when the news is being made *-3 *T*-4 . E_S
5413:9	Well , what newspapers , uh , do you read *T*-1 in Dallas ? E_S
5430:29	And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered *-1 *T*-2 it 's stolen *-3 before I can get out and get it . E_S
5433:12	I mean who would *T*-1 steal a newspaper ? E_S
5444:22	It just would n't be there whenever I tried it *T*-1 . E_S
5449:4	who would *T*-1 steal a newspaper ? E_S
5454:5	What part of California are you from *T*-1 ? E_S
5458:11	that 's where I am speaking to you from *T*-1 . E_S
5474:26	and I have a couple of students who *T*-1 have graduated and gone *-2 to work for them . E_S
5532:4	how you doing *T*-1 ? E_S
5536:4	What 's your name *T*-1 ? E_S
5558:4	What time is it *T*-1 over th- , E_S
5604:48	\[ \[ Wh- , \+ what did , \] \+ \[ how , \+ how \] did \] you get *-2 to know about the T I thing *T*-3 ? E_S
5609:16	\[ Wha- , \+ what \] are you working on *T*-1 ? E_S
5622:4	How do you like it out there *T*-1 ? E_S
5652:4	Where you at *T*-1 ? E_S
5673:22	\[ So , \+ so \] where do you go *T*-1 ? E_S
5697:16	Well , that 's what they look for *T*-1 . E_S
5702:31	\[ That 's why , \+ that 's why \] I did n't apply *T*-1 . E_S
5719:11	It 's what you do *T*-1 . You know . E_S
5736:4	When do you get out *T*-1 ? E_S
5742:24	Oh , you know I like what I 'm doing *T*-1 right now . E_S
5790:11	That 's why you want *-1 to join *T*-2 . E_S
5797:11	I go why you still there *T*-1 if you can earn a lot more money , once you 've get \[ \[ your , \+ your , \] \+ your \] Masters . E_S
5808:26	\[ They , \+ they \] like what they 're doing *T*-1 . E_S
5809:42	\[ They , \+ you know , they \] feel good about what they 're doing *T*-1 . E_S
5819:27	\[ And \+ and \] that 's not what they 're paying *T*-1 . E_S
5826:19	Well , it depends on what rank you are *T*-1 , of course . E_S
5849:48	But nobody can get one more point *-1 to become , you know , like whatever you need *T*-3 *-2 to earn so much money . E_S
5858:27	there 's a joke about I B M which *T*-1 says , you know , it 's like , uh , N_S
5870:36	and they have this whole team , you know , analyze why they came in *-2 last *T*-1
5904:40	I mean , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] why they 're having problems *T*-1 . E_S
5923:66	like all these people are just \[ standing , \+ sitting \] around , just going , you know , like what shall we do *T*-1 ? E_S
5929:11	They go what 's that *T*-1 ?
5930:10	This track which *T*-2 it 's going around the world E_S
5931:19	and they can tell you where your package is *T*-1 anywhere , any time . E_S
5953:28	\[ why did n't you buy , \+ why did n't you try \] something more mainline *T*-1 . E_S
5956:39	Well I B M does n't fire anybody . E_S Because uh , what they do *T*-1 is \[ they , \+ they \] put you in a different job . Which \[ y- , \+ you \] actually are like sitting around not doing anything *T*-2 . E_S
5956:94	Well I B M does n't fire anybody . E_S Because uh , what they do *T*-1 is \[ they , \+ they \] put you in a different job . Which \[ y- , \+ you \] actually are like sitting around not doing anything *T*-2 . E_S
5979:5	What they 'll do *T*-1 is like N_S
5985:15	It 's like how much paper is *T*-1 going in ? E_S
5996:11	That 's why they can say , you know , 0 there 's no layoff policy *T*-1 . E_S
6022:11	Because see what *T*-1 happens is 0 they have a good backup policy . E_S
6029:16	And so that 's what you 're going *-1 to go for *T*-2 . E_S

6078:15	So , that 's what they do *T*-1 . E_S
6080:34	\[ and they MUMBLEx , \+ and that 's \] why they 're so compatible *T*-1 . Because I mean N_S
6100:10	And then when you tried *-1 to erase and correct , you know , all the errors in your voice *T*-2 , it takes up all your memory . E_S
6106:14	it 's like why do you want more *T*-1 . E_S
6122:26	* \[ Imagine , \+ imagine \] what it *EXP*-2 is *T*-1 for us to make mark off models , you know . E_S
6129:40	Well , \[ when you get , \+ you know , when you get \] right down to it *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] more 0 they can do *T*-2 for you , \[ \[ the more , \+ uh , like I say , the more , \] \+ the more \] memory they 're going *-3 to require *T*-4 . E_S

6195:61	\[ It 's just a , \+ it *EXP*-2 's just a \] miracle \[ that \+ \] how fast that adds up *T*-1 , you know . E_S

6314:21	\[ it 's , \+ what it \] costs *T*-1 now is ridiculous , E_S
6315:5	what it 's going *-1 to cost *T*-2 sixteen years from now is just really scary . E_S

6327:36	\[ That 's , what , \+ that 's exactly what *T*-1 's \] happening in my family . E_S

6347:16	Well , that 's what she said *T*-1 to us . E_S
6358:18	it *EXP*-3 amazes me how much \[ the , \+ the \] costs are going *-1 to go up over the next ten or fifteen years *T*-2 . E_S
6359:19	I just do n't know how anybody 's going *-1 to do it *T*-2 . E_S
6362:23	And boy , it gets really scary when you start *-1 talking to them *T*-2 . E_S
6363:51	Uh , I have \[ a , \+ an \] eleven year old daughter *ICH*-3 now who *T*-1 's saying , gee , Dad , I want *-2 to be an allergist , E_S

6398:17	\[ It , \+ when \] I came on *T*-1 it was great because I had never had anything even close to \[ what , \+ what \] they offered *T*-2 . E_S

6508:68	* Seems like there 's so many kids that *T*-1 do n't have any since of , you know , what they want *-2 to be *T*-3 or do *T*-3 E_S
6522:19	For instance , everybody had what they called *T*-1 there social year , that they had *-2 to put *T*-3 in E_S
6534:15	I think possibly what , uh , they 're thinking about *T*-1 here , more external Peace Corps , Type things where we 're sending people off shore *T*-3 . E_S

6568:12	That 's what I was wondering about *T*-1 was whether they actually , N_S
6585:33	But it *EXP*-1 might be interesting * to see what *T*-2 would happen if you took kids \[ at a , \+ \] and then took then to another country instead of * having being exposed *-5 to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here , and take them to some other country that *T*-3 had different moral values , like Saudi Arabia where they could n't drink *T*-4 .

6600:41	You wonder if * being exposed to that for a while , what percentage of them *T*-1 would actually say , Hey , that 's not a bad way 0 * to do it *T*-2 , E_S
6601:11	because from what I understand *T*-1 , from some of the guys 0 I know *T*-2 , you know , crime , uh , is punishable , just almost , uh , instantly and public , E_S
6607:34	so you do n't have just a whole lot of , what we consider *T*-1 street crimes . E_S
6622:7	but when you do that *T*-1 then it becomes almost , uh , a MUMBLEx , N_S
6640:18	but I do n't know how they 'd enforce it *T*-1 , E_S

6797:4	Who *T*-1 's going *-2 to run it , you know , E_S

6834:53	Well , we , um , belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , which *T*-1 is like MUMBLEx the Mormon church . E_S
6844:29	I mean , they have a training center where they teach them *T*-1 , E_S
6889:11	I see how they were organized *-1 in , Central and South America *T*-2 E_S
6902:4	What are you afraid of *T*-1 with them ? E_S

6979:74	\[ I , \+ I \] \[ use my , \+ only use my \] credit card for , um , you know , when I , you know , N_S

7016:7	and when they do that *T*-1 , they begin *-2 paying interest right from that very day on . E_S
7056:36	It 's like , I 'd like *-1 to know where they determine *T*-2 that I 'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say , you get this much credit line . You know . E_S
7076:90	Well , it *EXP*-1 's interesting , uh , that , uh , people have \[ the , \+ generally the \] same view . of credit cards , no matter where you go *T*-2 . E_S
7135:24	and hobbies in our spare time is what we 've been selected *-1 to discuss *T*-2 today . E_S

7187:33	I 've done it before \[ and \+ \] when I was \[ in hi- , \+ in high \] school and college *T*-1 , and thoroughly enjoyed it , E_S
7260:16	we did some remodeling when we bought a house *T*-1 , E_S
7278:13	and that 's what I find *T*-2 in * making the dolls and things , that it gives me something that I can create *T*-1 , E_S
7309:7	so when it comes to , N_S
7372:13	in fact , when my children were growing up *T*-1 , we always had horses E_S
7383:16	and I was disappointed when I went to Texas *T*-1 . E_S
7434:4	which end do we push *T*-1 E_S
7443:67	and whether you vote for one person or the other person , the issues is \[ what , \+ you know , what \] you believe in *T*-1 , E_S
7450:75	so , it *EXP*-3 would be really difficult * to have that one \[ pers- , \+ perfect person \] that *T*-2 believed exactly what you believed *T*-1 . E_S
7460:152	and , uh , the people that *T*-1 are independent , you know , are the ones that *T*-2 \[ do n't , \+ uh , do n't \] really , uh , show up every year because they ca n't seem *-5 \[ to , \+ to \] decide which *T*-3 are the good aspects *RNR*-6 and which *T*-4 are the bad aspects *RNR*-6 of a candidate .

7480:34	they 're real liberal now \[ and \+ \] to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago , um , the Democrat party being liberal like they are *?* now , you know , would never be thought of *-2 *T*-1 , E_S
7517:42	but , uh , uh , down in D C \[ where , \+ where \] things are a little bit different *T*-1 , uh , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] women 's rights \[ and \+ \[ the , \+ \] and \] that sort of movement , E_S
7520:11	the elections where they have that topic *T*-2 seem *-1 to be a little bit better *ICH*-3 attended than some of the other ones . E_S
7531:26	I can understand \[ why , \+ why \] some of \[ the , \+ the \] rural areas , the voter turnout is n't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for \[ the , \+ the \] Midwest *T*-1 , E_S
7535:30	and , uh , it *EXP*-4 does n't matter who they put *T*-3 in office , they 're going *-1 to fall subject to , uh , the pressure that the lobbyists can put *T*-2 , E_S
7581:14	well that 's what \[ they , \+ they \] keep *-3 saying *T*-1 that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that *T*-2 are n't turning out \[ at the , \+ at the \] booths , E_S
7584:51	and they 're the ones that , uh , you know , *T*-1 really know what *T*-2 's going on , have the experience and seen , you know , how politicians can , you know , screwup *T*-3 or what ever . E_S

8062:19	We do n't even know where one is *T*-1 . E_S
8067:43	, I mean , you just , \[ you \+ \] did , what you wanted *-1 to do *T*-2 , E_S
8071:20	and now they tell you what * to teach *T*-2 and how long and , you know , what day , what period . E_S
8074:50	\[ you do n't know which *T*-1 is , \+ you do n't know , which *T*-2 is \] worse . E_S

8143:4	What would you serve *T*-1 , uh , if you were having a dinner party ? E_S
8147:37	it was , um , about movies , you know , what have you seen *T*-1 at the movies lately and stuff like that . E_S
8191:8	And , how old are your kids *T*-1 ? E_S
8231:11	That 's what we do *T*-1 , especially when it 's bad weather *T*-2 , man , * just , plug it in . E_S

8241:14	It 's good when you go to Tom Thumb *T*-1 though E_S
8291:4	Who \[ is the , \+ is the \] author *T*-1 ? E_S
8348:25	but as far as the costs for what you 're getting *T*-1 , uh , the longevity of the house \[ is not , \+ uh , is not \] worth it . E_S
8378:46	I have another gentleman , friend of mine , \[ who , \+ uh , who \] *T*-2 had a house built *-1 E_S
8432:49	so that 's kind of , 0 we just got with him and told him what all we wanted *T*-1 , E_S
8485:54	because \[ I , \+ I 'm \] always shocked at about , you know , what they have it appraised *-2 at *T*-1 , E_S
8504:129	but the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , I have *-1 to keep it under control because , for example , you know , it 's like \[ the , \+ the \] beginning of the semester when you go *-2 to pay for everything *T*-3 , everything is pretty rough , E_S
8507:41	it 's like , once the semester starts I 'm the one who *T*-1 has *-2 to control how much spending there is *T*-3 . E_S
8507:63	it 's like , once the semester starts I 'm the one who *T*-1 has *-2 to control how much spending there is *T*-3 . E_S
8512:4	Who *T*-1 takes care of that ? E_S
8518:14	So , uh , what *T*-1 happens is 0 you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts . E_S
8532:36	but \[ it 's not , \+ it 's not \] what I want *-1 to spend it on *T*-2 , you know . E_S
8552:6	so how do you keep track of where you are *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] your monthly spending *T*-2 ? E_S
8552:26	so how do you keep track of where you are *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] your monthly spending *T*-2 ? E_S
8554:73	Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , \[ I ba- , \+ I basically \] know how much I have *T*-1 , right ? E_S
8565:4	Where do you call to *T*-1 ? E_S
8597:4	What *T*-1 makes you , think so ? E_S
8633:23	\[ What are you , \+ what are you \] studying *T*-1 ? E_S
8637:6	And what do you think 0 you 'll do *T*-1 with that ? E_S
8650:6	or what 's the specialty that you 're looking for *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
8684:47	She is trying *-1 to start \[ he- , \+ her \] own business where she does that *ICH*-2 full time . Alterations and sewing . Stuff for the public *T*-3 E_S
8697:46	I guess , that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we 've got *T*-1 at the end of the month , E_S
8701:13	and we know what bills *T*-1 have *-2 to be paid *-3 , E_S
8714:21	You know , that 's when everybody goes crazy on * charging stuff *T*-1 . E_S
8716:65	Well then , uh , see , uh , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] one of the points which I do n't see *T*-1 , E_S
8726:59	like , like , uh , \[ for Chr- , \+ uh , for Christmas \] my roommate goes , what do you want *T*-1 . E_S
8757:34	but , um , the thing is , * especially remember when I was down in Argentina *T*-1
8783:12	What about when you have breaks *T*-1 like , um , Christmas or between sessions ? E_S
8806:19	* Let 's see how much money we have *T*-1 afterwards . E_S
8815:44	I went *-1 skiing \[ in , \+ over \] the Carolina Mountains which *T*-2 are n't anything , E_S
8835:30	So , oh well , * let 's see how long have we been talking here *T*-1 E_S
8858:34	But one of the things that I do *T*-1 when I 've got some spare time *T*-2 is I do some woodworking . E_S
8874:58	You know I do n't have *-1 to worry about *-2 getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust *T*-3 , E_S
8878:4	What *T*-1 are some of your things 0 you like *-2 to do *T*-3 ? E_S
8880:10	Well , when I have time *T*-1 I do like *-2 to sew , E_S
8887:22	and I would help her with whatever she happened *-1 to be doing *T*-2 , E_S
8916:21	Well , that 's kind of what my wife says *T*-1 . E_S
8948:21	Well , I 'm not sure what she does *T*-1 E_S
8981:48	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , sometimes they get disconnected *-1 when I 'm talking to them *T*-2 . E_S
8992:10	Uh , what else did I get *T*-1 in there , E_S
9021:18	and I 'm not sure when a good time 0 * to plant those *T*-2 is *T*-1 , if they should be planted *-3 early or later . E_S
9034:62	but \[ I do n't , \+ I had n't \] looked at a farmers almanac *-1 to find out when a good time for zucchini is *T*-2 . E_S
9066:7	So whenever you feel comfortable about * concluding *T*-1 , well , I 'm , N_S
9086:41	Uh , Robert \[ what do you , uh , think , \+ what substances do you think \] 0 *T*-1 are the most , uh , likely causes of air pollution ? E_S
9111:148	and I can remember \[ very \+ \] \[ etched , \+ * etched \] clearly in my mind , uh , *-2 flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down \[ and , \+ and \] really being unbelieving at , what *T*-3 looked like a , uh , N_S
9154:148	But they said \[ that , \+ that \] it really caused so much smog *ICH*-2 over , uh , the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they could n't do the , uh , piloting , uh , you know , the helicopter trips and that sort of thing . Which *T*-1 would be horrible , because \[ the , \+ there 's \] nothing , E_S
9166:9	Uh , what do you think 0 individuals could do *T*-1 , or society could do *T*-1 * to alleviate this problem . E_S
9174:42	apart from that , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what we can do *T*-1 as individuals . E_S
9175:4	What do you think 0 we can do *T*-1 ? E_S
9205:16	and that 's probably how we ought *-2 to do it *T*-1 . Uh , \[ individ- , \+ *-2 being individually responsible \] \[ as , uh , gro- , \+ in order *-3 to be group responsible . \] E_S
9208:49	I guess 0 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] to the point where I 'm cynical enough that I really do n't believe 0 anything will happen \[ unless , \+ unless \] there 's something economically justifiable about it *T*-1 . E_S
9222:25	And , uh , I do n't know how long \[ that , \+ that \] will take *T*-1 . E_S
9263:22	\[ when we , \+ when we \] \[ se- , \+ get serious \] \[ about cleaning , \+ about our motors \] in our automobiles *T*-2 \[ then , \+ uh , then \] maybe , you know , we 'll have a little bit of help .
9276:35	\[ That 's what they , \+ that 's what they , \] N_S
9285:11	that 's what they say *T*-1 E_S
9293:80	and I think 0 I can tell a difference in \] the comfort level , uh , particularly in the summer . Uh , you know , when it gets hot *T*-1 , and you have , \[ the , \+ that \] kind of a pressure from the pockets of air , uh , usually they say caused * by exhaust *T*-1 . E_S
9398:62	I mean , \[ \[ \[ when I , \+ when , \] \+ when , \] \+ when \] we came to San Antonio *T*-1 it was \[ \[ just like , \+ uh , you know , it just , \] \+ just \] swelter E_S
9438:39	Orlando is the only place 0 I 've ever been *T*-1 where I 've seen the car sweat *T*-2 . E_S
9445:91	well , I mean , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 I 've been in some places , you know , where the weather was just so mild *T*-1 , you know , places like Monterey , California or , you know , N_S
9451:61	and then you 've been to such extremes like San Angelo , Texas \[ where you just , \+ where you walk \] outside *T*-1 and you sweat *T*-1 , E_S
9464:103	I know 0 \[ \[ I , \+ I tend * to , \] \+ I tend *-1 to \] be able *-2 to get along with monotony in the weather when it 's very temperate *T*-3 . E_S
9523:22	The STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION . Which *T*-1 it 's an all new cast , but kind of the same idea , * going out to new places \[ and , \+ and \] doing new things and finding out about different people , E_S
9546:22	\[ When I , \+ when I \] started *-1 thinking about this *T*-2 , \[ that \+ \] those are some of my favorite shows ,

9563:22	And \[ what is , \+ what is \] he *T*-1 ? E_S
9565:26	He 's like a semigovernment type agent . Who *T*-1 \[ goes out then to , \+ uh , works for \] the Phoenix Foundation , supposedly . E_S
9582:7	See what we can come up with *T*-1 . E_S
9617:49	and I try \] and keep it on just a minimum amount of time , really when they 're up *T*-1 . E_S
9628:10	well , when my kids were little *T*-1 , I did have a T V set E_S
9636:29	\[ I , \+ I \] remember it when I was younger *T*-1 \[ of , \+ \] you know , *-2 catching it on P B S , E_S
9667:35	SESAME STREET comes on from like nine to ten , which *T*-1 is a good time E_S
9670:54	the timing \[ of , \+ of \] it *ICH*-2 is good , besides the amo- , what *T*-1 's on . E_S
9691:22	They just repeat over again . Which *T*-1 is also , N_S
9695:52	\[ that 's \+ \] another thing that *T*-1 's good about it , E_S when it comes on right in the dinner hour *T*-1 . I \[ f- , \+ can feel \] like I can let them sit in front of the T V and watch , E_S
9726:25	but the imagination of , * look what we can do *T*-1

9915:31	\[ I , \+ I 'm \] not sure which crop it was *T*-1 , E_S

9925:60	they 've got a lot of adjustments 0 * to make *T*-1 with *-3 coming out of what they 've been through *T*-2 now , E_S

9975:5	when he was in high school *T*-1 , he enjoyed *-2 going to baseball games . E_S
9993:34	I used *-1 to love *-2 to play baseball when I was a kid *T*-3 . E_S
10005:24	And I think , uh , 0 what *T*-1 caught so many of our attentions last year was that Nolan Ryan , you know , E_S
10082:30	I like *-1 to go watch the Giants when they come to Houston some times *T*-2 . E_S

10272:4	How old are they *T*-1 ? E_S
10330:23	and it 's like , all right who *T*-1 comes first
10337:24	\[ And , \+ and then \] when we go to sleep *T*-2 at night , you know , it 's like my husband and I have *-3 to try *-4 to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us . E_S

10409:4	what did he shoot him with *T*-1 . E_S
10411:23	Uh , well , uh , from what we can tell *T*-1 it was a pellet gun E_S
10453:41	and I feel like they need a big home , a nice place where someone can have the time 0 *-1 to play with them and things *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
10458:33	\[ I just , \+ I \] go hysterical when they do n't come home *T*-1 . E_S

10530:16	I asked the vet why he did that *T*-1 E_S
10531:44	and he said 0 he was probably weaned *-1 *-4 too young , which he was *T*-2 , because his mom was killed *-3 , E_S
10537:21	\[ Everybody , \+ people who *T*-1 do n't even like cats , \] like him . E_S

10652:27	We have , uh , uh , tortoise which *T*-1 is a black \[ and , \+ and \] orange . E_S
10680:23	well in fact I got her when I moved out of the house also *T*-1 . E_S
10694:21	I know 0 that 's how I am *T*-1 about Xanadu . E_S
10767:11	that 's how life goes *T*-1 . E_S

10801:132	and , uh , uh , \[ of the , \+ of the \] few good things that *T*-1 were in it , it did show , uh , a lot about the F B I .

E_S
10804:12	I wonder how truthful all of that was *T*-1 or whether there was fiction . E_S
10876:100	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it was more *ICH*-1 a lesson for Tom Cruise *ICH*-2 than anything else in terms \[ of , \+ uh , of \] how * to act *T*-3 from Dustin Hoffman , E_S

10883:71	it *EXP*-1 must have been great * just being with him \[ on , \+ on \] a daily basis and seeing how he prepares \[ for his , \+ for his \] lines *T*-2 and all that stuff . E_S
10886:42	and a good bit of that was filmed *-1 right in Cincinnati . Which *T*-2 is just forty-five miles \[ from , \+ from \] \[ where I am *T*-4 , \+ where I actually live \] in a suburb of Dayton *T*-3 . E_S

10921:60	Well , you know there are people , uh , referred to * as savants also , uh , who *T*-1 can do most phenomenal things E_S
11012:17	* Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is *T*-1 . E_S
11053:4	Where do you live *T*-1 ? E_S
11096:11	that 's what I do *T*-1 . E_S
11102:4	when they put centers and stuff like that . N_S
11107:28	well we have those *RNR*-2 , uh , which I think 0 *T*-1 is one of the best things is those *RNR*-2 cash for cans . E_S
11135:39	it 's just that sometimes it 's not the right people , which *T*-1 is \[ really , \+ really \] sad because , I wish 0 we would do more . E_S
11141:15	I think 0 what *T*-1 started it at work was that planet earth thing 0 we had *T*-2 last year . E_S
11149:5	where I work *T*-1 now we recycle all the computer paper . E_S
11211:14	That 's exactly what I did *T*-1 . E_S
11215:7	Exactly what I did *T*-1 ,
11252:68	\[ so many people need , \+ so many people go \] to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes , when , you know , these are perfect *T*-1 , E_S
11274:14	That 's exactly what I do *T*-1 . E_S
11280:12	That 's what I do *T*-1 with a lot of my daughter 's things is 0 I 'll store \[ her , \+ you know , like her \] out dated or , \[ out of , \+ out of \] season clothes in them E_S
11335:64	I mean , I just go ahead and take it to \[ the , \+ the \] regular place , where \[ it 's , \+ you know , they \] just accept it *T*-1 . E_S
11409:7	And when they were questioned *-1 about it *T*-2 they said well , we 're running late , E_S
11421:34	because that is discouraging \[ when you , \+ when you \] do that *T*-1 . E_S
11429:56	I feel like I 'm \[ doing , \+ uh , doing \] something for the community when I 'm doing that *T*-1 . E_S
11482:19	and then it gets to where he ca n't , you know , control his movements at all *T*-1 . E_S
11487:4	What does , uh , N_S is N_S \[ Robby , \+ Robin \] Williams *T*-1 ,
11493:7	Oh how does he do serious *T*-1 . E_S
11504:18	But , uh , well , what was that show *T*-1 ,
11521:11	That 's why I was thinking 0 it could n't be just a totally funny part *T*-1 . E_S
11532:7	Well what have you seen *T*-1 ? E_S
11550:4	Where did you cry *T*-1 . E_S
11557:23	Um , I cried the first time when \[ the , \+ um , the \] wagon man got killed *-1 *T*-2 , when they attacked him *T*-3 . E_S

11576:4	when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him *T*-1 . E_S
11584:33	And that horse has been such a pal to him , when he was alone *T*-1 . E_S
11604:4	What did you think *T*-1 about the buffalo scenes . E_S
11618:22	Um , I had a friend who *T*-1 had fixed some , uh , \[ chili , \+ buffalo chili \] \[ and , \+ \] about a week before * went *-2 to see the movie . E_S
11636:26	Um , I thought 0 the scenes when the buffalos running *T*-1 , though , were beautiful , E_S
11649:19	And * to think about how it just changed the whole landscape *T*-1 , you know ,
11656:11	I wonder how they kept up with them , though *T*-1 , E_S
11677:35	and , uh , they had *-1 to teach a wolf how *-3 \[ to , \+ to \] howl *T*-2 . E_S
11735:46	there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of \[ woman , \+ how women \] have changed *T*-1 , E_S
11790:16	could you tell me what you think 0 *T*-1 contributes most to , uh , air pollution ? E_S
11793:91	I mean , while it *EXP*-1 's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories , uh , pollute a lot , uh , if you look at how much pollution *T*-2 is say kicked *-3 up by an active volcano , uh , it *EXP*-4 's certainly less than clear that anything 0 man can do *T*-5 in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all . E_S
11794:4	What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
11797:18	I 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are *T*-1 now , \[ and , \+ and \] what the amount of material that they do , uh , put *T*-2 into the atmosphere . E_S

11833:11	it depends which way the wind 's blowing *T*-1 from Boston , cause we 're like forty miles south of Boston , E_S
11865:57	because in order *-4 to , uh , keep with the E P A standards \[ which , \+ which \] *T*-1 tend *-2 to be visible , uh , what *T*-3 's coming out of your smokestack , they do all their emissions at night . E_S

11911:4	How are \[ your , \+ uh , your \] lakes *T*-1 , E_S

11971:45	Oh , \[ they did n't say , \+ they did n't say \] what though , E_S
11974:16	They did n't say what , E_S
11988:14	I mean , what do you think 0 we can , uh , I guess *RNR*-2 as individuals or as a group , do *T*-1 about , uh , air pollution ? . E_S
11995:10	Uh , how we go about that *T*-1 , \[ it 's \+ uh , uh , it 's \] a little bit difficult . E_S
12003:175	\[ \[ you ne- , \+ yo- , ne- , \] \+ I think 0 you need \] \[ a , \+ a \] vehicle something like , uh , Ralph Nader , Nader 's Raiders , \[ or , \+ \[ where , \+ \] uh , or , \] uh , uh , A A R P , which *T*-1 has a lot of members . Uh , if you can get those types of groups . E_S

12066:110	The , uh , United States and Canada \[ \[ are I guess , \+ is , \] \+ is , \] going into , uh , some types of agreements * to limit , uh , what *T*-1 's being given *-2 out by power plants , E_S
12077:9	Well , what do you think *T*-1 about like a device , a meter right on a tail pipe E_S
12078:24	and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted *T*-1 ? E_S
12119:27	But if you was talking about something which *T*-1 was more or less universal that , uh , busses and any kind of vehicle , had *-2 to pay a pollution tax , uh , this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters , E_S
12156:37	Other than that I 'm not sure \[ what , \+ what \] individuals can do *T*-1 other than like I said *-2 get involved *-3 through a group or an organization . E_S

12233:12	That 's what I like *-1 to make *T*-2 is just real neat stuff like that E_S
12246:47	It \[ kind of , \+ uh , kind of \] down played compared to what you would like *T*-1 , huh . E_S
12257:4	what did I make *T*-1 that night . E_S
12270:5	when Ricky and Carrie came over *T*-1 we made , um , a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit . E_S
12278:17	But you know , when we 're having guests *T*-1 , we just kind of say , oh * just do it . E_S
12297:20	I made an apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over *T*-1 E_S

12398:84	gosh \[ this , \+ uh , this \] whole thing now with \[ all the , \+ uh , all the \] political cartoons on the Democrats and how \[ they 're , \+ uh , uh , they 're \] \[ in , \+ in \] a sad way *ICH*-1 for ninety-two now in terms of the presidential election , anyway *T*-2 . E_S
12408:13	I mean how many years are we going *-1 to wait *T*-2 E_S
12409:32	\[ and , \+ and \] \[ what , \+ what \] do you do *T*-2 with the people that *T*-1 are over there in the mean time . E_S
12433:41	and in fact they were so well dug in that , uh , when we sent our tanks around behind them *T*-2 they could n't get turned *-1 around in time . E_S
12440:64	Saddam thought 0 he had the whole thing , uh , figured *-3 out \[ to , \+ to \] which way we were coming *T*-2 and \[ which , \+ \[ what , \+ what \] \] our doctrine was *T*-1 \[ that , \+ \] uh , E_S
12440:109	Saddam thought 0 he had the whole thing , uh , figured *-3 out \[ to , \+ to \] which way we were coming *T*-2 and \[ which , \+ \[ what , \+ what \] \] our doctrine was *T*-1 \[ that , \+ \] uh , E_S
12448:31	it *EXP*-1 'll be interesting * to see what *T*-2 comes out of it whether \[ the , \+ this \] opposition will , uh , uh , N_S
12449:41	today the Turks , uh , agreed *-1 to support the Kurds , which *T*-2 is something 0 they 've never done *T*-3 before E_S
12473:29	\[ in , \+ in \] fact , when he was Governor of New Hampshire *T*-1 , I believe 0 *T*-2 . E_S
12498:5	when they \[ be- , \+ became \] a country *T*-1 they \[ more than , or , \+ more or \] less decided 0 they were n't going *-2 to take it anymore , E_S
12525:74	and I think 0 that 's the problem 0 the P L O has *T*-1 is that \[ when they , \+ whenever one group of them \] decides that they 're going *-2 to negotiate , or they 're going *-3 to do something , they 're going *-4 to try *-5 to make some peace *T*-6 , \[ but , \+ \] uh , the end result is that \[ they , \+ there \] so many factions of them \[ and , \+ \] uh , some more violent than others , some with a certain agenda different than the others , or they split , E_S
12535:61	\[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] looking forward to *-1 seeing what *T*-2 happens over there in the next couple of months , E_S
12576:4	What are your \[ m- , \+ music \] interests *T*-1 ? E_S
12608:17	but then , uh , when I , N_S
12636:5	when he played DANNY BOY *T*-1 it just almost brought , tears to your eyes , because he can make that flute sing . E_S
12690:41	\[ I , \+ I 'm \] getting now to the age where I do n't like \[ the new stuff that *T*-3 's coming an- , \+ \[ and \+ \] much of the new stuff that *T*-1 's coming \] out *T*-2 , E_S
12709:74	\[ \[ I 've got a , \+ I 've got a , \] \+ I 've got a \] two year old who *T*-1 's now getting , N_S
12747:5	what els- , . E_S
12748:10	Well , what kind of music do you not like *T*-1 ? E_S
12761:16	I do n't know what that is *T*-1 , E_S
12825:16	I ca n't remember how far in advance we reserved , tickets *T*-1 E_S
12863:37	\[ I ca n't , \+ I do n't \] know what that 's about *T*-1 . E_S
12866:4	what 's that \[ real , \+ oh , not real \] old , my wife she is old too , dancer *T*-1 , uh , E_S
12873:40	Uh , uh , uh , \[ I think 0 I know who you 're ta- , \+

12883:11	I know who you 're talking about *T*-1 . E_S
12948:22	and I never have figured out how he won , uh , entertainer of the year for about , three or four years in a row *T*-1 . E_S
12969:53	\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 \[ I , \+ I \] know who that is *T*-1 , E_S
13030:7	and when they would come and change the records *T*-1 \[ the guys would , \+ the guy would \] give her the old records E_S
13035:15	so , that 's where I got my , N_S
13119:10	back then when I was a kid *T*-1 , there was n't that much T V , E_S
13129:45	\[ Tha- , \+ that 's \] \[ just what , \+ just what \] you had *T*-1 , E_S
13163:33	\[ \[ Wha- , \+ what day , \] \+ what day \] was that on *T*-1 , E_S
13173:9	uh , what do you think *T*-1 about , uh , the idea of * having volunteer service for everyone ? E_S
13191:16	\[ when , \+ when \] would people do it *T*-1 ,
13192:4	when they finished high school *T*-1 ? E_S
13198:24	in fact I was n't very mature when I left high school *T*-1 E_S
13209:45	The only complication \[ \[ is , \+ is , \] \+ is \] how do you fund something like this *T*-1 ? E_S
13236:60	\[ \[ \[ what , \+ what would , \] \+ what would you find , \] \+ what would \] you have them do *T*-1 ? E_S
13239:4	What would you have these people do *T*-2 if they were brought in *-1 ? E_S
13298:4	Where * to start *T*-1 . E_S
13326:42	and that is that N_S some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which I think 0 *T*-1 \[ is a , \+ is an \] invasion of privacy . E_S
13335:49	I get some of these things *ICH*-4 in the mail that I wonder , where in the world did they get my address *T*-2 or where did they get my name *T*-1 *T*-3 . E_S
13335:80	I get some of these things *ICH*-4 in the mail that I wonder , where in the world did they get my address *T*-2 or where did they get my name *T*-1 *T*-3 . E_S
13340:68	it 's funny because \[ I 'm , \+ I was \] in the process of * filling one out when I decided 0 I would make this phone call *T*-2 , E_S
13341:46	but , uh , I have n't got to the end of it *ICH*-2 yet where it asks all that salary information and everything *T*-1 , E_S
13342:9	but , when you have *-1 to send that back in the mail with your name on it , your salary information *T*-2 , \[ I , \+ I \] just have a real hard time * doing that ,
13343:24	uh , E_S and they ask you what type of household items *ICH*-1 do you own *T*-2 , like stereos and T V -s and V C R -s E_S
13344:65	\[ and , \+ and \] you hate *-1 to send something *ICH*-2 off with your name and address E_S and what types of things do you own *T*-1 E_S and what kind of money do you make *T*-1 E_S
13344:94	\[ and , \+ and \] you hate *-1 to send something *ICH*-2 off with your name and address E_S and what types of things do you own *T*-1 E_S and what kind of money do you make *T*-1 E_S
13345:20	and you wonder , well , who *T*-1 's going *-2 to get ahold of this and think , um , that 's a nice place 0 * to go *-3 rob *T*-4 . E_S
13361:24	I got one tonight about six thirty when I sat down *-1 to eat dinner *T*-2 , E_S
13388:22	there is one particular group to which I belong *T*-1 E_S
13427:22	and , you know , usually when they call you *T*-1 , it 's going *-2 to be \[ when you s- , \+ right when you sit \] down to dinner *T*-3 because \[ they know , \+ they pretty much know \] that you 're at work all day E_S
13427:83	and , you know , usually when they call you *T*-1 , it 's going *-2 to be \[ when you s- , \+ right when you sit \] down to dinner *T*-3 because \[ they know , \+ they pretty much know \] that you 're at work all day E_S
13428:31	and they call you right \[ when , \+ when \] you 've just gotten home from work *T*-1 . E_S
13437:57	and they 'll probably call me up and , you know , call me back and bother me when I sit down to dinner later on *T*-1 , E_S
13461:76	I actually during that period of time \[ from , \+ you know , usually from \] six o'clock or six thirty , whenever I get home *T*-1 , until eight or so , I will shut off the phone E_S
13465:44	and , uh , my daughter gets irate , \[ when I , \+ when I \] do that *T*-1 because , you know , she 's a teenager E_S
13472:27	so she 'll , you know , N_S why are you cutting off the phone *T*-1 ,
13484:7	but when I come home from work *T*-1 , there 's times 0 I need *-2 to pay bills *T*-3 , E_S
13490:32	but \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] where answering machines are nice *T*-1 , because if it 's really important they 'll leave a message E_S
13497:62	And , uh , if I 've had a lot of phone calls during the day \[ when \+ occasionally when \] we have , uh , N_S
13499:33	we have *-1 to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system *T*-2 , E_S
13505:14	I get to where \[ I , \+ I \] turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone *T*-1 , E_S
13512:8	Now what I have done *T*-1 is , 0 I have forwarded my home phone to the answering service at the office so that I do not have *-2 to have \[ a , \+ uh a \] ring at all . \[ If I , \+ if I \] want *-3 to do that . E_S
13534:15	But at the office when I , you know , N_S
13540:24	And \[ when I , \+ when I \] want *-1 to be , you know , not bothered *-4 during the day *T*-3 , that 's exactly what I do *T*-2 . E_S
13540:90	And \[ when I , \+ when I \] want *-1 to be , you know , not bothered *-4 during the day *T*-3 , that 's exactly what I do *T*-2 . E_S
13568:11	that 's what we have *T*-1 . E_S
13594:115	so I imagine 0 we will be , uh , shifting over to that service uh , \[ for a while , \+ or \[ if , \+ \] in a while \] . As soon as we determine what we 're going *-1 to do *T*-2 with Contel after we bought Contel . E_S
13643:34	uh , there 's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated *-1 from college *T*-2 the impression was that a woman 's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps *ICH*-3 a return to the office , but not necessarily . E_S
13644:65	Uh , now I think 0 the change that I 've seen *T*-1 as much as anything is one where couples , uh , are more carefully planning their intention on how *-3 to both share homemaking duties *T*-4 and also how women will , uh , have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place *T*-6 *T*-5 *T*-2 . E_S
13644:101	Uh , now I think 0 the change that I 've seen *T*-1 as much as anything is one where couples , uh , are more carefully planning their intention on how *-3 to both share homemaking duties *T*-4 and also how women will , uh , have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place *T*-6 *T*-5 *T*-2 .

13644:173	Uh , now I think 0 the change that I 've seen *T*-1 as much as anything is one where couples , uh , are more carefully planning their intention on how *-3 to both share homemaking duties *T*-4 and also how women will , uh , have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place *T*-6 *T*-5 *T*-2 . E_S
13656:19	Uh , I have wondered why they allowed , or let , you know , both the father and mother go *T*-1 , uh , E_S
13664:18	Well , uh , from what I understand *T*-1 there 's been studies that , uh , these children are , uh , more rebellious . E_S
13670:104	So , \[ \[ I , \+ I do n't , \] \+ \[ I , \+ I \] guess \] 0 we 'll have *-1 to see another generation *-2 to see what differences a child being brought *T*-3 up , you know , in \[ a , \+ uh , kind of a , \] uh , community , rather than a home . E_S
13680:47	and I know , uh , 0 in my children 's case it was one where , uh , pretty much up until the older of two was \[ in , \+ \] uh , * let 's see , I guess basically starting junior high E_S and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force *T*-2 . E_S
13688:46	so I guess 0 my experience \[ is , \+ is \] just with what we did *T*-1 E_S
13703:4	What do you mean *T*-1 ? E_S
13726:52	and \[ I could , \+ you know , I could \] envision a society where that would happen *T*-1 and make an interesting , uh , uh , story or whatever . E_S
13731:56	In fact , I think 0 it sort of raises nurturing and * being a mother to what it ought *-3 to be *T*-1 which *T*-2 is a respected profession . E_S
13731:80	In fact , I think 0 it sort of raises nurturing and * being a mother to what it ought *-3 to be *T*-1 which *T*-2 is a respected profession . E_S
13749:28	Maybe we 'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of , say , *-1 taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care *T*-2 . E_S
13759:148	Uh , I know that there are young people , characterized * , I guess as * being half my age , so \[ that \+ by definition that \] means , 0 they 're young . Uh , \[ that , \+ \] in my work place , who *T*-3 are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably *-4 would consider *-5 paying a woman , uh , eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year *-1 to take care of their child , E_S
13759:182	Uh , I know that there are young people , characterized * , I guess as * being half my age , so \[ that \+ by definition that \] means , 0 they 're young .

13772:54	Or * to put their child \[ into a s- , \+ into a home setting , \] where \[ they would , \+ you know , like \[ they , \+ they \] would \] \[ get , \+ leave \] at eight in the morning \[ and , \+ and \] drop a two year old off in a home where you knew 0 there were going *-1 to be four other kids *T*-2 *T*-3 E_S

13783:26	Uh , I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures \[ on , \+ on \] the order of what I quoted *T*-1 to someone , because that 's \[ what \+ \] the experience 0 they want *T*-2 *T*-3 E_S
13783:81	Uh , I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures \[ on , \+ on \] the order of what I quoted *T*-1 to someone , because that 's \[ what \+ \] the experience 0 they want *T*-2 *T*-3 E_S
13798:61	Are you aware *ICH*-2 at all , \[ of , \+ of \] \[ what they would , \+ what they cost *T*-1 ? \] E_S
13803:41	\[ I just know , \+ I know \] several single mothers who *T*-1 absolutely ca n't afford it . E_S
13819:16	\[ What , \+ what \] do you envision *T*-1 for the next twenty years as far as women in American society ? E_S
13855:50	Maybe , uh , the possibility \[ of , \+ of \] women , uh , who *T*-1 deliberately say , no , E_S we 'll let the man \[ will \+ take \] care of the children perhaps , in the event of a separation or whatever . E_S
13887:7	Well what do you think *T*-1 about the idea of , uh , kids having *-2 to do public service work for a year ? E_S
13907:24	I think 0 it teaches kids how * to grow *T*-1 . E_S
13911:15	Uh , uh , what I 'm thinking about *T*-1 is 0 back , well , when I was a kid *T*-2 , and much earlier than that , kids were kind of , \[ i- , \+ i- , \] N_S you know ,
13911:53	Uh , uh , what I 'm thinking about *T*-1 is 0 back , well , when I was a kid *T*-2 , and much earlier than that , kids were kind of , \[ i- , \+ i- , \] N_S you know ,
13916:8	Because when I was in the Girl Scouts *T*-1 , we did a lot of public service things , because that 's just part \[ \[ o- , \+ of , \] \+ of \] the scouting , and , you know . N_S
13926:25	You know , kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old *T*-1 they fall out of that , E_S
13936:32	\[ And , \+ and \] I do n't know what the high rank *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 for the gals E_S
13954:10	and then when they \[ young , \+ young \] adults *T*-1 , there 's even less interest there . E_S
13992:61	\[ I think that , \+ yeah , I think that \] we need *-1 to really address what we 've done *T*-2 here E_S
14025:4	How do you usually keep up with current events *T*-1 ? E_S
14041:20	\[ and , \+ and \] how do you rate the , uh , N_S
14044:49	\[ For , \+ for \] local news I think 0 we do real well where it 's , N_S
14053:24	On the whole , I 'm pleased when I have an opportunity * to hear just the facts *T*-1 . E_S
14083:16	I do n't know which that answer is *T*-1 . E_S
14106:111	Well , I had heard a couple of people , you know , that I had talked to *T*-1 about certain programs say that , you know , they had read other things besides what SIXTY MINUTES presented *T*-2 and that they did n't present it nearly the same way as the , you know , news articles or whatever 0 \[ they had , \+ they had \] already been familiar with *T*-3 . E_S
14107:35	So , I started *-1 questioning just \[ how , \+ how \] bias they really were *T*-2 , E_S
14110:40	\[ I do n't know di- , \+ I do n't know how \] old you are *T*-1 , E_S
14139:13	and that 's where I \[ get , \+ get \] into the problem \[ with , \+ with \] him *T*-1 . E_S
14147:4	What did you think *T*-1 of the news coverage of the war ? E_S
14160:25	Did that help you understand a lot what *T*-1 was going on
14164:120	but \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it helps me everyday in *-1 trying *-2 to review \[ wh- , \+ \] the state that the world is in *T*-3 and try *-2 to guess where we 're going *T*-4 . E_S
14168:53	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] think , uh , 0 my background is probably what *T*-1 absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES . E_S
14171:4	What weekly , um , magazine do you look at *T*-1 , E_S
14193:19	Uh , here 's *T*-2 what *T*-1 went on in Asia over the past week , E_S
14243:29	and \[ it will , \+ depending on what topic you called in *-1 to hear about *T*-2 whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update , it will \] give you , um , updated information . E_S
14264:9	So , who 's your , uh , favorite team *T*-1 ? E_S
14266:4	Who do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
14291:45	So , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] even know who your favorite team is *T*-1 , actually . E_S
14324:9	Well , who 's the running *T*-1 , E_S
14352:5	Who else is , *T*-1 uh , oh N_S
14371:4	How did they end up *T*-1 this year ? E_S
14425:9	Um , who is it *T*-1 ,
14447:21	Um , I 'm done , where I work *T*-1 . E_S
14470:24	I did n't look at the clock when we started *-1 talking *T*-2 , E_S
14478:20	So other than the Vikings , who do you like *T*-1 ? E_S
14480:15	Um , actually , when I was younger *T*-1 , I was a Cardinal fan , too . E_S
14491:22	Um , I do n't know who else I 've ever . N_S
14498:8	Back when they were in Saint Louis *T*-1 ? E_S
14505:66	Other than that , I mean , you know , \[ when I 've , \+ you know , when you \] grow up in a city that *T*-1 has \[ the , \+ you know , one of the \] greatest football teams until the last few years *T*-2 , you kind of tend *-3 to get caught *-4 up in it . E_S
14516:67	I mean \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 \] was really exciting , * growing up \[ when , \+ when \] the Cowboys were really big *T*-2 . E_S
14523:39	I guess 0 probably since about eighty-four , about eighty-five was when they started *-1 kind of going downhill really *T*-2 , E_S
14538:4	What are they going up to *T*-1 ,
14553:45	but obviously yeah , they 're all going up , MUMBLEx more or less is what it 's going *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
14560:34	I just remember *-1 trying *-2 to figure out where you could get N_S
14564:95	\[ las- , time , \+ last time \] 0 I went to the Cowboys game *T*-1 was during that , um , N F L strike , or \[ the , \+ when they had the \] scab \[ team , \+ teams \] in there *T*-2 , E_S
14615:4	how 'd you find out about this *T*-1 ? E_S
14626:13	and that 's how we learned about it *T*-1 , E_S
14651:13	so , uh , what do you think , that , uh , N_S
14652:39	\[ \[ what do , \+ what do , \] \+ what do \] you think 0 we can do *T*-1 * to solve the crime in America ? E_S
14657:33	but \[ \[ what , \+ what , \] \+ what \] are the steps *T*-1 ? E_S
14662:15	and if so , why has crime increased *T*-1 ? E_S
14664:47	Well , see the problem \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , what *T*-1 happens is \[ as , \+ \] that \[ you 're , \+ uh , you know , as you \] go from the country to a city , crime always increases , right ? E_S
14677:8	Now what *T*-1 happens is 0 all those that *T*-2 do n't have any money in the country move to the cities , E_S
14679:13	They say , why ca n't we have the same things that these other people have *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
14681:7	and what we have *-1 to do *T*-2 is , 0 we have *-3 to go , uh , *-4 get some stuff , steal it , and then , you know , just resell it . E_S
14692:22	And that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased *T*-1 . E_S
14714:25	and you can tell by the people who *T*-1 are always caught *-2 , that these people are there *-3 to get money for drugs . E_S
14730:41	And , in fifty-one and fifty-two , the police came to the high school where I was *T*-1 and were telling us how * to recognize when kids were on drugs *T*-2 *T*-3 , how * to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance , that they were giving their drugs away in order *-4 to get the kids started * *T*-5 , and so on , and so on . E_S

14735:59	and we 're just really , uh , uh , now , trying *-1 to , uh , figure out how * to cope with the problem *T*-3 because it has grown so huge . E_S
14738:73	\[ there 's a , \+ there 's \[ a , \+ uh , a \] \] song that I know *T*-1 which *T*-2 says , you know , tha- , N_S
14742:5	What you 're doing *T*-1 is , 0 you , you know , N_S
14752:34	and another one of the problems is that the people who *T*-1 are the dealers , the big dealers in drugs , \[ may be , \+ may be \] part of the power structure that *T*-2 's keeping us from * spending the money in that direction . E_S
14787:52	But the guy at the very top , the one \[ who *T*-1 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] really making the millions and the millions is the one who *T*-3 also many times is part of the power structure , uh , \[ the , \+ \] uh , and had the political uh , pull to \[ keep things from , \+ uh , keep \] the interest or the emphasis in some other direction , other than on the drug dealing , E_S
14787:95	But the guy at the very top , the one \[ who *T*-1 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] really making the millions and the millions is the one who *T*-3 also many times is part of the power structure , uh , \[ the , \+ \] uh , and had the political uh , pull to \[ keep things from , \+ uh , keep \] the interest or the emphasis in some other direction , other than on the drug dealing , E_S
14796:18	he goes , hey , how you doing *T*-1 ,
14829:73	it 's like , those guys , at one point , you know , they had so much money that they did n't know what * to do *T*-1 with it . E_S
14916:25	Oh , it sure is *?* especially when you work out of town and everything , that way *T*-1 . E_S
14933:40	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] talked to some who *T*-1 's really had some bad experience E_S
14940:78	You know , \[ I just , \+ I 'm just \] shocked *ICH*-3 at the end of the month , *-1 to see what damage I have did *T*-2 , E_S
14957:14	they 're there when you need them *T*-1 . You know , like in emergencies , or whatever . E_S
14997:36	and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in *T*-1 . E_S
15016:7	And when you pay fifteen dollars a month *T*-1 it sure takes a long time . E_S
15049:9	Well , how do you feel about it *T*-1 ? E_S
15071:67	so , I 'd have *-1 to say that , uh , \[ it , \+ you know , the people who *T*-2 do it , \] well , some feel 0 it 's rewarding . E_S
15073:23	but , uh I do n't know how we got the subject *T*-1 , MUMBLEx . E_S
15090:9	Well , how long you been in San Antonio *T*-1 ? E_S
15100:11	That 's how we know each other *T*-1 . E_S
15115:5	What other types of community service would they be talking about *T*-1 . E_S
15134:51	But \[ that , \+ that \] time is minuscule compared to \[ what , \+ what , \] MUMBLEx they were referring to *T*-1 . E_S
15165:15	but , you know how it is *T*-1 MUMBLEx . E_S
15172:25	I think that maybe that 's why some people do it *T*-1 is , uh , * to see the other cultures \[ or , \+ you know and \] some of that . E_S
15192:46	And they 're allowed *-1 to take that time off and then come back where they left off *T*-2 . E_S
15207:85	Well , I mean , in that respect a lot of people join the military *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] grow up and to decide what they want *-2 to do *T*-3 , E_S
15216:74	\[ but , \+ uh , and \] a lot of people have gone in the military , I mean , you know , when they 're in the college *T*-1 . E_S
15221:35	Uh , \[ others , \+ people \] do n't know what they want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
15223:45	But I think 0 a lot of it 's , you know , when \[ the- , \+ \] people get older *T*-1 , they 'll do something like that . E_S
15254:78	it *EXP*-1 's interesting 0 we got this topic because \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't know what I marked *T*-2 off *-3 to get this , E_S
15273:5	How many times have you talked *T*-1 ? E_S
15296:4	What other topics have you had *T*-1 ? E_S
15312:13	I forget exactly what the focus was *T*-1 on that one . E_S
15318:22	And I talked to this person who I gathered from *-2 speaking to her , \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 she and her family just did n't have much , E_S
15323:56	And so she basically did n't use credit cards and did n't know very much about them and how they work *T*-1 , \[ and , \+ and \] how you can use them to your advantage *T*-2 , \[ and , \+ and \] how , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] can do certain things with them *T*-3 . E_S
15323:88	And so she basically did n't use credit cards and did n't know very much about them and how they work *T*-1 , \[ and , \+ and \] how you can use them to your advantage *T*-2 , \[ and , \+ and \] how , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] can do certain things with them *T*-3 . E_S

15350:33	and I have n't gotten a one of them yet when I 've called *T*-1 . E_S
15369:10	And then what else did I have *T*-1 ? E_S
15385:39	\[ that *T*-3 told , \+ and he told \] me when he gave it to me *T*-1 that it was impossible 0 * to kill *T*-2 , E_S
15388:10	no matter what , you could n't kill it . E_S
15451:74	\[ there 's a , \+ there 's a \] certain scene in the movie \[ where there 's , \+ um , where \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] \] on a buffalo hunt *T*-1 . E_S
15455:50	And they have a particular child actor , uh , \[ who *T*-1 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] being supposedly run *-3 down by a buffalo . E_S
15459:7	And when they were trying *-1 to film that *T*-2 , the buffalo that they used *T*-3 for that scene was Neil Young 's buffalo . E_S
15463:16	I ca n't remember what they said 0 his name was *T*-1 . E_S
15489:41	I guess 0 he was taking Kevin Costner to like the site where he was going *-1 to be *T*-2 or whatever . E_S
15539:4	What have you seen *T*-1 lately ? E_S
15580:42	\[ and , \+ but , \] you know , you could tell when it was coming *T*-1 . E_S
15599:16	but it was just how she got so caught up *T*-2 , E_S
15714:5	whenever you are an employee of the company *T*-1 , you are using its assets , E_S
15722:4	Where do you work *T*-1 ? E_S
15728:13	and that 's where most of our , uh , injuries occur *T*-2 . E_S
15732:7	And what we do *T*-1 is we 'll have a drug test \[ if an , \+ if \[ a , \+ a \] \] break or a man , uh , has an accident . E_S
15740:4	when he goes to the doctor the first time *T*-1 . E_S
15753:21	Now , I do n't know how T E C would handle it *T*-1 . E_S
15759:43	there was one guy that we tested *T*-1 for preemployment for drugs who *T*-2 absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines , E_S
15779:25	And then I also had a friend who *T*-1 was just around some people that *T*-2 were smoking cocaine . E_S
15871:43	and of course , you know , they did specifically single them out when we started *T*-1 , you know , that they were going *-2 to do all them first . E_S
15882:4	Which I thought 0 *T*-1 was interesting . E_S
15899:10	Oh , what kind of drugs did you use *T*-1 , if you do n't mind ? E_S
15945:86	Plus , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] want *-1 to think \[ that , \+ that \] you 're working with people who *T*-2 are not only putting out their fair share , but that *T*-3 are not endangering your life , E_S
15968:20	like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water , you know , that kind of thing *T*-1 . E_S
16018:17	I have a friend who *T*-1 was telling me about her brother who *T*-2 gets high all the time , E_S
16018:43	I have a friend who *T*-1 was telling me about her brother who *T*-2 gets high all the time , E_S
16019:24	and I have just casually asked her what he did *T*-1 for a living . E_S
16020:56	And she said , Oh , he 's the supervisor of this chemical land fill , you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff *T*-1 . E_S
16027:35	And I just , you know , went , Oh , where ? . E_S
16090:16	\[ What , \+ what \] is , N_S
16094:11	that 's what it said * to discuss *T*-1 some
16096:37	well , it says , \[ why would you , \+ what you would \] have *T*-1 for a dinner party . E_S
16107:12	it says what you would have *T*-1 for a dinner party , E_S
16109:19	I 'll tell you , what I 'm going *-1 to have *T*-2 . Um , if I can find it . E_S
16120:4	when you have fish au gratin *T*-1 , N_S
16152:18	it *EXP*-2 's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party *T*-1 . E_S
16170:5	What I 've been doing *T*-1 when I get invited *-2 someplace and bring something *T*-3 , I make , uh , food kabobs . E_S
16170:25	What I 've been doing *T*-1 when I get invited *-2 someplace and bring something *T*-3 , I make , uh , food kabobs . E_S
16185:21	Or even have you ever seen where \[ they , \+ they 'll \] take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out , and then put the fruit in the watermelon *T*-1
16217:59	Then you 've got *-1 to drain the water out of the watermelon because , you know , when you scrape it *T*-2 , it makes the water . E_S
16298:20	I mean , no matter how careful you are *T*-1 you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot . E_S
16313:21	I think 0 I know what you 're talk- , N_S
16343:5	when it thickens *T*-1 the cornstarch might get a little , I do n't know , N_S
16353:14	and MUMBLEx someone who *T*-1 's just going *-2 to make it first time , it 's , N_S
16413:38	and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day , where you cut the pie *T*-1 , it would soak into the pie shell E_S
16417:9	Well , how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own *T*-1 ? E_S
16473:54	Because I 'm always worrying 0 it wo n't firm up because \[ it , \+ when you take it \] out of the saucepan *T*-1 it 's like , boy , I hope 0 this thickens a little more because it 's not like real package thick , you know , E_S
16474:5	when you cook a package *T*-1 , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a little less , E_S
16485:9	so , when you pull the Saran Wrap back *T*-1 , you sort of should be a little careful , pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap E_S
16493:20	\[ after , \+ well when \] it starts *-1 steaming a lot *T*-2 , uh , I definitely , yeah , put it in the refrigerator , E_S
16509:18	so , , that 's why I do that *T*-1 . E_S
16522:13	do you know who he is *T*-1 ? E_S
16539:21	I do n't like that , when they start *T*-1 , E_S
16554:54	You know , I mean they 're not \[ the , \+ the \] typical country where they 're just , you know , my wife left me , my dog left me *T*-1 , you know . E_S
16611:4	when , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't play *T*-1 , N_S
16617:4	What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S
16621:4	What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S
16642:13	and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it *T*-1 E_S
16654:22	I mean it 's nice when you have a piece \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 is \[ so , \+ so \] peaceful , that everybody likes *T*-2 *T*-3 , you know , E_S
16660:160	and \[ you do n't , \+ because it does n't have words , you know , you do n't \] feel like , there 's anything 0 you have *-1 to remember *T*-2 , you know , as far as *-4 singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean *T*-3 E_S
16679:16	Oh , I see what you 're saying *T*-1 . E_S
16685:29	I mean , I do n't even know who *T*-1 did which ones , E_S
16690:30	\[ I could , \+ I know \] which ones *T*-1 come next , E_S
16724:13	do you know who Chuck Mangione is *T*-1 ? E_S
16731:4	what 's his name *T*-1 ,
16747:30	I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like *T*-1 . E_S
16768:14	You know , how many people *T*-1 are in Simply Red , Stuart , E_S
16770:32	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't remember how many people , E_S
16774:13	It 's not where \[ it 's , \+ it hurts \] your ears *-1 to hear it *T*-2 . E_S
16775:53	But \[ it 's not as , \+ it 's not like , \] uh , Chicago where it 's got that much instrument to it *T*-1 . E_S
16791:4	where are you *T*-1 ? E_S
16815:11	That 's why I was just w- , N_S
16834:16	\[ What , \+ what \] do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
16838:13	and that 's what I know *T*-1 , E_S
16872:11	that 's how it works *T*-1 . E_S
16881:31	And she has since taken off with another lawyer who *T*-1 had been , uh , getting cocaine from his client and then selling it , E_S
16936:41	because \[ if that 's what , \+ if that 's what \] the punishment is *T*-2 \[ in that , \+ in that \] instance , then you 're always going *-1 to say , you know , not gui- , N_S
16950:20	Well , especially with something where \[ you have *-1 to f- , \+ you have *-2 to find \] it beyond a reasonable doubt *T*-3 . E_S
16981:19	It 's getting , to where a just really want *-1 to read it *T*-2 . E_S
16989:7	but when I do get *-1 to sit down \[ and , \+ and \] read *T*-3 , I like *-2 to read the Bible E_S
17021:4	how old is your daughter *T*-1 . E_S
17034:4	What 's his name *T*-1 again ? E_S
17103:20	and it helps *-2 explain who people are *T*-1 . E_S
17104:45	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] about the hardest thing is , who *T*-1 's related to who . E_S
17150:9	Oh , what can , N_S
17151:4	what is his name *T*-1 . E_S
17154:18	well N_S you know when you 're recording *T*-1 you ca n't \[ re- , \+ remem- , \] N_S
17191:26	oh , I think 0 I know who you 're talking about *T*-1 . E_S
17238:15	Oh , those hedges when they started *-2 moving *T*-1 . N_S
17243:5	Whenever \[ they \+ , they \] made that into a movie *T*-1 , I was thinking oh , my gosh if they show that , I 'll just die . E_S
17273:76	But , uh , most of the time they do n't \[ with , \+ \] \[ when , \+ \] follow books very well when they make them into movies *T*-1 . E_S
17412:14	oh , N_S gosh why ca n't I think of their names *T*-1 , E_S
17426:21	Uh , well , you know who I 'm talking about *T*-1 . E_S
17443:11	That 's why I like *-1 to watch that MASTERPIECE THEATRE on channel thirteen *T*-2 , because they 'll take a classic \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , televise it you know , put it into a viewing format , more or less . E_S
17467:7	but when I do *T*-1 I \[ just , \+ just \] love it . E_S
17508:5	what type of exercise do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
17563:5	when I go *-1 visit them *T*-2 , uh , I get on that thing every now and then . E_S
17566:18	it 's nice because when the weather 's bad *T*-1 \[ you ca n't , \+ you do n't \] have any excuse . E_S
17665:28	I 've always found that , uh , when you write things down and set goals *T*-1 it *EXP*-2 's a lot easier * to \[ keep , \+ uh , keep \] something going . E_S
17669:10	Uh , when I was in high school *T*-1 we had a choice of , uh , * taking , uh , physical education courses on exercise , E_S
17675:67	we kept charts of our progress , and , uh , consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved *T*-1 over the weeks . E_S
17699:4	How often do you , uh , uh , go out each week on your walking *T*-1 ? E_S
17707:20	\[ how far , \+ about how far \] do you go *-1 walking *T*-2 ? E_S
17765:4	Which , uh , shows do you watch *T*-1 on T V ? E_S
17790:13	and , uh , what is the other one called *-2 *T*-1 . E_S
17831:19	But then that was back when , uh , you know , the high impact and , N_S
17923:4	how do you feel that it should be applied *-2 *T*-1 ? E_S
17963:22	and they final get up to where they kill somebody else *T*-1 , E_S
17992:32	You know , \[ it seems like \+ when they go to prison *T*-1 , it , \[ they \+ \] really seem like \] it 's a rough time for them E_S

18049:11	This is what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen . E_S
18056:37	\[ and , \+ but , \] I , do n't know what else * to do *T*-1 with some of these people , that *T*-2 are , N_S
18087:70	Uh , a lot of people really does n't think that much about it , because it has n't happened to them , which *T*-1 it has n't *?* to me either ,
18096:53	\[ I , \+ you \] read about it in the paper , every day , somebody who *T*-1 's done this , or that , something really horrible E_S
18106:39	And as far as the other states , I honestly do n't know what their capital punishment is *T*-1 . E_S
18121:55	and people like Charles Manson , \[ and , \+ and \] some of these other people , who *T*-1 were sentenced *-2 to death at the time 0 they repealed the death penalty *T*-3 , were sentenced *-4 to life in prison , and are \[ now , \+
18125:11	The people who *T*-1 were there originally , \[ when they , \+ when they \] changed the laws *-2 to revoke the death penalty *T*-3 , \[ are still in there for , \+ are in prison , \] in quote , for life , \[ and , \+ and \] are now coming up for parole , E_S

18207:63	I mean , \[ it 's a \+ it 's a \] scary world *ICH*-2 out there anymore , where you 're afraid *-1 to go out *T*-3 , E_S
18216:20	and it was n't that way when I was younger *T*-1 . E_S
18224:43	But , uh , even the small towns now though , has really changed from when I was a kid *T*-1 , E_S
18231:5	when I was a kid *T*-1 , I would run between my neighbors , three and four blocks sometimes ,
18259:9	Um , what do you do *T*-1 this weekend ? E_S
18263:9	Huh . Which is , N_S
18264:21	\[ wh- , d- , \+ what do \] you \[ plan , \+ have *T*-1 planned *-2 \] for your yard ? E_S
18281:5	What part of the state do you live in *T*-1 ? E_S

18318:10	and then when it gets wet *T*-2 , you know , you do n't even want *-1 to get out in the yard , E_S
18328:10	um , where you live *T*-1 is there a real high , uh , alkaline *RNR*-2 or ash *RNR*-2 content E_S
18341:14	I know right where that 's at *T*-1 . E_S
18367:4	How do you put trees in there *T*-1 ? E_S
18394:64	and the first thing 0 \[ the , \+ the \] old guy there at the stand asked *T*-3 is what part of town we lived in *T*-2 because he said , uh , \[ I 've got , \+ I 've got \] a dozen different varieties E_S
18397:14	That 's basically what he was trying *-1 to tell us *T*-2 . E_S
18441:33	\[ that 's , we , \+ that 's what we 're \] searching *T*-1 , uh , E_S

18623:29	it seem like it be just the opposite when you get , N_S
18634:75	people still use it enough \[ in , \+ like in \] towns like Clarendon and other areas \[ that , \+ \] where they irrigate *T*-3 . E_S
18647:16	I do n't see how anything can survive out there , for long periods of time *T*-1 . E_S
18673:73	and , you know , we 're trying *-1 to decide \[ \[ what , \+ what \] * to , \+ what *-2 to \] put *T*-3 on one side of the house and things like that , E_S

18714:29	Uh , I think 0 that 's about where it is *T*-1 . E_S
18717:10	Uh , what type of , uh , utilizations do you make *T*-1 of it ? E_S
18733:32	Here at work I have the T I one thousand which *T*-1 is a three eighty-six base \[ mach- , \+ machine . \] E_S
18748:92	And \[ that , \+ I know 0 that , \] uh , brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because , I had taken it over from a friend who *T*-1 was working on it E_S
18772:10	Uh , what I 've gotten into *T*-1 more recently are the tools 0 *T*-2 to use them . E_S
18785:5	When everyone was in Samna *T*-1 I was still in P F M , E_S
18792:20	It was a real memory hog when you started *-1 making large blot changes to it *T*-2 . E_S
18797:59	at least the version 0 I had *T*-1 tended *-2 to keep copies of that . Of what you were changing *T*-3 and deleting *T*-3 off in memory until \[ all of , \+ all of \] a sudden you got a disc full error . Not a fun thing 0 * to try *-4 to recover from *T*-5 . E_S
18818:57	Well , it 's just a huge file that *-1 tries *-2 to describe the requirements of what you 're trying *-3 to build *T*-4 . Uh , to one level down from assistant description . E_S
18834:39	uh , E_S maybe you 'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things *T*-1 . E_S
18835:21	I think 0 that 's when \[ you , \+ you \] start *-1 deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have *?* *T*-2 . E_S When you start *-3 seeing what all they can do *T*-1 for you *T*-2 . E_S
18835:96	I think 0 that 's when \[ you , \+ you \] start *-1 deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have *?* *T*-2 . E_S When you start *-3 seeing what all they can do *T*-1 for you *T*-2 . E_S
18835:114	I think 0 that 's when \[ you , \+ you \] start *-1 deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have *?* *T*-2 . E_S When you start *-3 seeing what all they can do *T*-1 for you *T*-2 . E_S
18885:4	Where do you live *T*-1 ? E_S
18892:31	But I 'm now in Palo Alto , California which *T*-1 is , I think 0 *T*-2 , the recycling capital of the world . E_S
18901:25	They just opened up a recycling center where we go *T*-1 and donate \[ our , \+ our \] things and dump them off ourselves . E_S
18916:25	There 's a few places in Houston where they 're trying that out *T*-1 . E_S
18917:75	I do n't know \[ if it 's , the , \+ if they 've done it \] citywide yet *ICH*-2 or not where they have the color coded , uh , bags and , uh , bins *T*-1 . E_S
18932:49	and the garbage men come by and , uh , collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty *T*-1 or leave the ones if they 're still in good shape . E_S
18944:62	we 've got several bins \[ in our , \+ \[ on , \+ in \] our \] garage where we , uh , you know , sort things out *T*-1 \[ and , \+ and \] take it \[ to , \+ to \] the appropriate places . E_S
18949:40	At my office , we have two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes *T*-1 *-2 to pick up their mail , E_S
18979:34	And it 's really going *-1 to be a mess when they have *-2 to start *-3 hunting for places 0 * to put the things *T*-4 *T*-5 . E_S
19006:58	And then \[ the , \+ uh , they \] take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing *T*-1 , E_S
19007:62	and at the end of every year , uh , they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who *T*-1 want *-2 to put it on their flower beds . E_S
19031:120	I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-2 's , \] to me more of a convenience *ICH*-4 * to have them come *-3 pick it up , then * to get that two cents when you take it to the store *T*-1 . E_S
19038:28	We still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans , for cash *T*-1 . E_S
19087:54	and \[ wi- , \+ \] there , right outside \[ the , \+ that \] place where the garbage can is *T*-1 we have the bag for the newspapers , E_S
19093:52	my husband about once a weekend he 'll go , uh , to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out *T*-1 . E_S
19109:5	when you were talking about the composting *T*-1 , the only thing that our city did *T*-3 that was they \[ di- , \+ uh , provided \] a place 0 for us to take our Christmas trees . Uh , \[ to \+ 0 for them to \] mulch *T*-2 . \[ For , \+ for \] city use *T*-4 . E_S
19175:16	And I 've seen where some places have taken a plastic *T*-3 and , uh , they 're recycling them into other plastics . And the Styrofoam also into insulation and things like that *T*-3 E_S
19204:53	Now we quit that about \[ two years ago , \+ no , three years ago \] when we got china mugs for everybody *T*-1 . E_S
19229:79	\[ I h- , \+ I have \] *-1 to believe 0 everybody is starting *-2 to pay attention and take heed of what *T*-3 is happening . E_S
19241:9	Well , what is your view *T*-1 ,
19245:71	well , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-3 's \] real confusing right now * to know what kind \[ \[ of a , \+ of , \] \+ of a \] threat it is *T*-1 , I guess 0 *T*-2 , E_S
19249:155	\[ it , \+ it \] takes awhile * \[ to , \+ to \] get used to something , E_S you know , \[ if , \+ if \] they have completely chain- , N_S \[ on \+ \] the , place has completely turned that much around to where they 're \[ not , \+ you know , not \] what they used *-2 to be *T*-1 *T*-3 , E_S
19249:192	\[ it , \+ it \] takes awhile * \[ to , \+ to \] get used to something , E_S you know , \[ if , \+ if \] they have completely chain- , N_S \[ on \+ \] the , place has completely turned that much around to where they 're \[ not , \+ you know , not \] what they used *-2 to be *T*-1 *T*-3 , E_S
19255:181	\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] hard * \[ to , \+ to \] know anymore if it 's \[ a , \+ a \] threat one way or another because , uh , it used *-3 to be \[ s- , \+ \] so , \[ f- , \+ \] much in the past that whatever the top said *T*-2 the rest fell , you know , rank and file in behind it . E_S
19266:59	\[ whereas , \+ whereas \] in the past it was seen *-3 as , you know , whoever *T*-1 was the head of \[ the , \+ the \] communist party was seen *-2 as , you know , untouchable . E_S
19301:16	I do n't know what the percentages are *T*-1 , E_S
19308:21	And finally , you know , who *T*-1 knows E_S
19318:79	Even if it is , you know , the best thing in the long run , it just steps on too many people *ICH*-3 's toes , who *T*-1 are comfortable with the way 0 the situation is *T*-2 . E_S
19324:42	\[ I , \+ I \] think , you know , 0 what I 'd have *-1 to , N_S
19329:5	What I have n't seen *T*-1 is \[ the , \+ \] uh , you know , a great stepping back in the military , situation . E_S
19353:28	Uh , but , of course , the people who *T*-1 have challenged that or tried *-2 to do , \[ on- , \+ \] \[ have cor- , \+ have \] not been world powers . E_S
19365:40	Whereas , you know , if the Soviet Union would have , who *T*-2 knows what taking over Mongolia \[ or , \+ or \] something like that , \[ who *T*-1 is really , \+ \] will we have been more just rhetoric , uh , rather than *-3 going in there officially or , you know , physically and try *-4 \[ to , \+ to \] remove them . E_S
19365:96	Whereas , you know , if the Soviet Union would have , who *T*-2 knows what taking over Mongolia \[ or , \+ or \] something like that , \[ who *T*-1 is really , \+ \] will we have been more just rhetoric , uh , rather than *-3 going in there officially or , you know , physically and try *-4 \[ to , \+ to \] remove them . E_S
19472:21	And that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers *T*-1 E_S
19490:37	I knew a lot of guys in the service 0 when they were sent *-1 to Germany *T*-2 *T*-4 they said 0 that 's the safest place in the world because if a war starts , all the bombs are going *-3 to go right over Germany E_S
19502:42	well , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] guess , 0 what they 'd have *-1 to do *T*-2 * to , N_S
19505:15	I hope that what *T*-1 's happening is exactly the way 0 it appears *T*-2 . E_S
19510:80	it *EXP*-2 's kind of a strange thing 0 we 've been trying *-1 to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens *T*-3 you say , whoa , * wait a minute , E_S
19512:11	Nobody knows what * to do *T*-1 . E_S
19514:54	you know . \[ \[ What 's , \+ uh , what 's , \] \+ what 's \] *T*-1 really happening here . E_S
19521:13	But you wonder how , well , this thing , N_S
19522:16	\[ w- , \+ who , \] was it *T*-2
19523:104	Boris Yeltsin , \[ the guy that *T*-1 's running the , \+ \] uh , \[ or \+ \] evidently was elected *-2 president of the Soviet , for the Russian republic , which *T*-3 is , I guess , the , uh , the biggest , E_S
19531:35	I get confused between \[ all the , \+ \] which *T*-1 is the Soviet provinces versus which *T*-2 are \[ the , \+ the \] Russian provinces , versus what *T*-3 are , N_S
19531:56	I get confused between \[ all the , \+ \] which *T*-1 is the Soviet provinces versus which *T*-2 are \[ the , \+ the \] Russian provinces , versus what *T*-3 are , N_S
19531:94	I get confused between \[ all the , \+ \] which *T*-1 is the Soviet provinces versus which *T*-2 are \[ the , \+ the \] Russian provinces , versus what *T*-3 are , N_S
19549:5	what I read *T*-1 when the , uh , \[ lee- , \+ \] uh , United Nations was setup *-2 \[ in , \+ in \] San Francisco *T*-3 , one of the first things 0 the Russians wanted *-4 to do *T*-5 was * bring in each one \[ of the , \+ uh , of these , \] you know , republics , as a separate country , E_S
19549:19	what I read *T*-1 when the , uh , \[ lee- , \+ \] uh , United Nations was setup *-2 \[ in , \+ in \] San Francisco *T*-3 , one of the first things 0 the Russians wanted *-4 to do *T*-5 was * bring in each one \[ of the , \+ uh , of these , \] you know , republics , as a separate country , E_S
19578:21	wh- , uh , w- , what do you get shot *-1 by *T*-5
19579:51	something that *T*-2 's called *-1 \[ a , \+ an \] economic force or what *T*-3 is called *-4 a military pact , E_S
19593:4	What do you do *T*-1 with all these troops that *T*-2 have been taken care of *-3 by , uh , Bulgaria \[ and , \+ and \] Czechoslovakia E_S
19601:16	Well , that 's what they 're saying *T*-2
19603:4	what are we going *-2 to do *T*-1 with all the soldiers over there ? E_S
19608:4	What *T*-1 's going *-3 to happen to the economies that *T*-2 are no longer have \[ a , \+ a \] million plus people *ICH*-4 \[ in the indu- , \+ you know , in each country \] from the U S ... E_S
19614:22	the question was , uh , what kind of books do you read *T*-1 for entertainment , uh , uh , I guess 0 *T*-2 , E_S
19633:22	\[ What , \+ uh , what \] kind of , N_S
19655:18	By , uh , somebody who *T*-1 was there E_S
19659:10	a guy who *T*-1 was there as a , uh , foot soldier . E_S
19672:9	So , what 's the latest one 0 you 've read *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
19677:55	I read an awful lot of , uh , periodicals and , uh , you know , almost what you call *T*-1 reference books . E_S
19737:129	It was made *-2 * to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because , you know , \[ it was , \+ uh , if you read it , it only emancipated \] those who *T*-1 were in areas , uh , in rebellion against the United States . E_S
19738:15	All the other areas which *T*-2 \[ would , \+ I think at that time would \] have included West Virginia and , oh , * may have been *RNR*-3 Kentucky , a few states , you know , that *T*-1 were not part of the South but still had slaves . E_S
19744:17	Well , you know what else *T*-1 really surprised me , now E_S
19768:4	where 's some reference to this goddamn State of Texas and the role that they played *T*-1 either leading up to *RNR*-2 or in *RNR*-2 the Civil War *T*-3 . E_S
19778:85	and \[ the only , \+ the only \] way that they had any part in it *T*-3 was after worth as to , you know , who *T*-1 's going *-2 to be going there . E_S
19785:82	if you ever get a chance * to go over to Vicksburg , the battleground at Vicksburg , uh , there 's an area \[ there where \+ there was , \] uh , some Texas , uh , groups *T*-1 E_S
19792:119	but \[ he held off , \+ uh , you know , just he and a handful of guys managed *-1 to hold off \] the whole Union navy for a while from *-2 coming up the Sabine River which *T*-3 was of no consequence but still is an interesting story . E_S
19794:18	Well , you know , why they actually held them off *T*-1 ? E_S
19840:58	hell , \[ we did n't even , \+ you know , we did n't even \] know where the Mason Dixon Line was *T*-2 , E_S
19857:18	so , you know . What does that make me *T*-1 ,
19884:28	Well , I 've gone to the point where \[ my husband , \+ my husband \] travels , I get out like , you know , two or three books *T*-1 . E_S
19906:36	You know , I think 0 I read HAWAII , when I was about ten years old *T*-1 E_S
19917:5	whatever one it was *T*-1 it was such a blockbuster seller . E_S
19950:19	Well , because that 's where my folks all came from *T*-1 . E_S
19983:29	and , uh , I was reading DUNE . Which *T*-1 seeming rather ironic . E_S
20027:83	*-2 even having read the book , and I 've read that book probably three times , *-2 watching that movie , I could n't figure out , what they were talking about *T*-1 , at all . E_S
20054:9	Somebody who , *T*-1 saw the movie here the other day told me 0 it was the most terrifying thing 0 they 'd ever seen *T*-2 , E_S
20072:23	I do n't have the foggiest notion what it 's about *T*-1 , E_S
20121:21	Well , \[ how , \+ how \] do you feel *T*-1 about the immigration laws ? E_S
20131:23	well , I 'm not real sure why I got this topic *T*-1 , because I do n't think 0 I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws . E_S
20146:275	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] I think , uh , you know , 0 the , uh , embargo 0 we placed *T*-1 \[ on the , \+ uh , on the \] Russian Jews , although we MUMBLEx \[ of , \+ \] uh , spent years and years , uh , *-5 lobbying for their release and their ability * to , um , immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred , we simply said that , uh , instead of the , uh , hundred and fifty thousand or so who *T*-2 wanted *-3 to immigrate to this country , we cut that by , uh , two thirds . E_S
20177:123	so , I do n't have \[ any , \+ any , \] uh , relatives \[ that I am , \+ or , or , uh , several generations back , that I am \] familiar with *T*-2 their names and how they fit into the family *T*-1 . E_S
20184:39	and I have n't taken the time or effort * to learn what they are *T*-1 . E_S
20186:77	Well , I think 0 in a way , though , uh , uh , I also have , uh , an opposite point of view , which *T*-1 is , uh , 0 although I believe 0 we should , uh , permit , uh , you know , constant immigration into this country uh , \[ I think 0 we should , \+ uh , primarily for economic reasons , I think 0 we should \] have , um , some quotas , E_S
20192:25	my grandparents came over during the time when , uh , there were quotas *T*-1 . E_S
20214:134	There \[ are , \+ were \] some , uh , regulations *ICH*-2 over , E_S I do n't know whether they 're laws passed * \[ or , \+ or \] whatever they 're called *-4 *T*-1 , uh , just recently , where , uh , people with certain diseases can not be excluded *-5 , uh , from , uh , immigration *T*-3 . E_S
20216:30	and , uh , recently , uh , tuberculosis , which at one time , if you had *T*-1 tuberculosis you could not get into this country uh , they dropped that also . E_S
20272:87	It seems *-2 to say , 0 I 'll tax them if you ca n't get enough money , instead of *-3 trying *-1 to figure out how * to cut budgets or cut spending \[ or , \+ or , \] you know , get all of the waste out of the spending *T*-4 . E_S
20276:21	Uh , I do n't know what y'all are paying *T*-1 in Dallas , E_S
20281:50	and , you know , we 're paying almost eight percent sales tax , right now . Which *T*-1 seems to me nuts . E_S
20283:19	and , you know , when I left there *T*-1 , we paid six cents on the dollar , E_S
20310:4	Where are you at *T*-1 ? E_S
20333:4	Where \[ do you , \+ do you \] come from *T*-1 originally E_S
20361:16	\[ Where , \+ what \] did they say *T*-1 to , uh , N_S
20363:19	* Render unto Caesar 's what *T*-1 is Caesar 's . E_S
20367:47	So , you know , \[ even , \+ even \] in the story where they had *-1 to pay the taxes *T*-2 , the disciples , and , uh , Jesus said the money in the fish 's mouth or in the fisher , inside the fish . E_S
20371:30	And , uh , I thought of those two things when \[ I was , \+ I was \] holding for a long time *T*-1 . E_S
20385:16	And so that 's what they were trying *-1 to do *T*-2 with the tax situation . E_S
20386:23	And , of course , that 's when he said well you render unto Caesar 's what *T*-1 is Caesar 's *T*-2 , E_S
20386:52	And , of course , that 's when he said well you render unto Caesar 's what *T*-1 is Caesar 's *T*-2 , E_S
20387:17	you render unto God what *T*-1 is God 's . E_S
20411:16	And I get outraged when I feel like they go up for useless reasons *T*-1 , E_S
20421:43	\[ Do you , \+ do you \] deal with taxes much in what you do *T*-1 when you work *T*-2 E_S
20421:57	\[ Do you , \+ do you \] deal with taxes much in what you do *T*-1 when you work *T*-2 E_S
20438:17	Did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act *T*-1 , it seemed like it made everything harder ? E_S
20471:28	So that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get *T*-1 back . E_S
20485:26	Well , I get twenty six paychecks , which *T*-1 would come out *-2 to be in thirteen months . E_S
20516:15	Just because of exactly what you said *T*-1 , E_S
20535:7	And when we bought this house *T*-2 , we looked at * doing a fifteen year note , because it added more *ICH*-1 to the payment , but not significant amounts , you know , E_S
20542:12	That 's what we 're looking at *T*-1 , fifteen or maybe twenty . E_S
20615:9	Well , what was her name *T*-1 ? E_S
20673:24	That 's funny 0 that 's where you 're from *T*-1 . E_S
20675:4	What are trying *-1 to get *T*-2 ? E_S
20689:18	but that 's pretty much what I do *T*-1 . E_S
20691:11	That 's what you do *T*-1 , uh , E_S
20701:4	What did you think *T*-1 of Sam ? E_S
20712:22	He was very good for Lubbock when he came to , you know , N_S
20717:30	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] what he said *T*-1 here . E_S
20729:67	He 's broadened , \[ our , \+ \] um , the devices that we 're making *T*-2 , too , which *T*-3 has made us as lot more stable . E_S
20758:56	Well , since you live close , I do n't know if you know , um , about what Louisville is doing *T*-1 with recycling , E_S
20769:5	when they first started *-2 doing that in the paper , \[ and \+ \] I read about that *T*-1 , E_S I was just praying that , that would be in our area , because we 've been recycling for quite some time . E_S
20770:79	And , you know , we separate everything out , and then have *-2 to haul it up to a Metco , you know , which *T*-1 is a real pain . E_S
20795:50	Because *-1 to take it to a Metco , you have *-1 to take it when they 're open *T*-3 , you know , which *T*-2 is always a real pain . E_S
20795:79	Because *-1 to take it to a Metco , you have *-1 to take it when they 're open *T*-3 , you know , which *T*-2 is always a real pain . E_S
20799:10	And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot *T*-1 , we thought , oh , this is great . E_S
20809:22	I could n't even think of what you call them *T*-1 . E_S
20820:14	That 's about what we do *T*-1 too . E_S
20843:53	but you kind of get , I guess , into a little routine , you know , where it *EXP*-2 \[ becomes , \+ is \] automatic , now , * to throw , different things in different places *T*-1 , E_S
20871:33	and there was so many baby food jars , kind of what *T*-1 started it . E_S
20879:22	and so , you know , when I found out some places 0 * to take it *T*-1 *T*-2 , N_S
20915:37	T I has got this organization called * T A D which *T*-1 is T I'ers Against Drugs . E_S
20916:65	And , you know , we 're recycling aluminum cans *ICH*-3 up here \[ and , \+ \] uh , just what you would buy *T*-1 out of the machines and drink *-2 here E_S
20946:34	I know 0 they 've started over in Richardson where my dad lives *T*-1 . E_S
20970:50	And a lot of time , I find it during the day \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm rocking my little girl to sleep *T*-1 , E_S
21077:37	Well , I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever *T*-1 is geared *-2 for children . Because , with two kids N_S
21095:57	And then , um , as my kids got older and started , you know , *-2 recognizing what *T*-1 was going on , I thought , this is n't really very good . E_S
21112:39	Uh , now \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know who the characters are *T*-1 , E_S
21122:34	uh , E_S I can remember *-1 staying home , when I was five and six *T*-2 , and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT . E_S
21222:11	That 's what I need *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
21254:20	So , I do n't know why the two of them happen , *-1 to be my two favorite shows *T*-2 , E_S
21305:4	Which of course he needed *T*-1 . E_S
21309:4	which in QUANTUM LEAP you get *T*-1 N_S
21315:31	but he 's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do *T*-1 E_S
21324:26	So \[ what do you , \+ what do you \] consider *T*-1 your favorite shows ? E_S
21330:54	And , \[ I , \+ I \] like the old \[ ser- , \+ series \] better when , um Dede was in there *T*-1 . E_S
21342:16	I ca n't remember what her name is *T*-1 , E_S
21349:23	and I think 0 that 's what they try *-2 to do *T*-1 , E_S
21355:138	Well , but , see I read an article \[ about , \+ in T V GUIDE \[ about , \+ uh , about \] \] HUNTER , and about \[ his , you know , latest , \+ you know , his \] three girls , whatever you want *-1 to call them *T*-2 E_S
21384:23	and I think 0 that 's what I did n't like *T*-1 . E_S
21393:64	and , you know , \[ you kind of , \+ you 're wondering , \] you know , well when did this happen *T*-1 ? E_S
21404:29	Well , I 'm afraid 0 that 's what \[ they , \+ they \] really wanted *-1 to do *T*-2 , um , E_S
21413:16	and maybe that 's what the public wants *T*-1 , E_S
21416:14	and that 's what *ICH*-2 I always enjoyed *T*-1 about it . E_S
21426:40	And that really made it a very interesting , uh , show to where you never really knew \[ which , \+ which \] one *T*-1 was going *-6 to show up . You know , whether it was going to , where they 're going *-2 to be real close *T*-4 or whether they 're just going *-3 to be partners *T*-5 , you know E_S
21426:70	And that really made it a very interesting , uh , show to where you never really knew \[ which , \+ which \] one *T*-1 was going *-6 to show up . You know , whether it was going to , where they 're going *-2 to be real close *T*-4 or whether they 're just going *-3 to be partners *T*-5 , you know E_S
21426:133	And that really made it a very interesting , uh , show to where you never really knew \[ which , \+ which \] one *T*-1 was going *-6 to show up . You know , whether it was going to , where they 're going *-2 to be real close *T*-4 or whether they 're just going *-3 to be partners *T*-5 , you know E_S
21434:18	and you always wonder , why they do n't , you know , get together or whatever *T*-1 . E_S
21438:26	And so I guess 0 that 's what they decide *-1 to do *T*-2 E_S
21453:39	I 've been watching Nickelodeon all last week , because they had what they called *T*-1 MAXIMUM SMART . E_S
21458:68	Well , \[ the , \+ the \] last day , all 0 they did *T*-1 was the last season , to where the two of them got married *-2 *T*-3 E_S
21469:23	but I heard 0 that 's what *T*-1 killed it E_S
21474:20	that , uh , interplay died when they got married *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
21498:68	she had been at the beginning \[ the , \+ the \] intelligent one , \[ the , \+ the \] one who *T*-1 always solved the things \[ and , \+ and \] figured out and kept Max from * getting real messed *-2 up . E_S
21499:18	Well , in short , whenever they got married *-1 *T*-2 , she got dingy . E_S
21503:14	You know , why would they do that *T*-1 ? E_S
21509:56	\[ I , \+ I 'm \] guess 0 it 's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows N_S
21514:4	which *T*-1 kind of , N_S
21515:24	like in the big soap opera shows , which I do n't enjoy *T*-1 because of that , E_S
21518:47	Well , do you you watch , um , what is that show *T*-1 , WHO 'S THE BOSS *T*-2 ? E_S
21530:85	but , \[ as , \+ as \] I 've seen it , \[ they 've , \+ they 've \] done sort of the same thing to where \[ they 've , \+ they \] started *-1 to let them get together *T*-2 , E_S
21535:98	and I think 0 they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about *T*-1 . E_S
21542:18	it *EXP*-1 's funny how \[ \[ we , \+ uh , we , \] \+ we \] romanticize people *T*-2 E_S
21547:7	but when he gets married *-1 *T*-2 , then you do n't care any more or something like that , E_S
21553:23	Do you think 0 that 's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret *T*-1 , or at least they keep it quiet *T*-1 . E_S
21560:24	I know 0 it affected me when I was younger *T*-1 . E_S
21590:5	when you get married *-1 *T*-3 you 've got relationship 0 * to develop *T*-2 in the first place , E_S
21649:34	So \[ \[ what , \+ what , \] \+ how \] do you spend the time with your children *T*-1 ? E_S
21664:38	I mean , as a matter of fact , that 's what we 're doing *T*-1 tonight . E_S
21666:16	\[ What , \+ what \] are you doing *T*-1 ? E_S
21681:32	it 's coach pitch , until you get nine which my little boy will be *T*-1 nine in May . E_S
21692:39	\[ I , \+ I \] used *-1 to play soccer when I was that age *T*-2 up in New York , E_S
21714:80	\[ Do you go , how about like for , \+ uh , do you go for long vacations , \] like a week or something when they have school off *T*-1 ? E_S
21725:6	And where do you go *T*-1 ? E_S
21740:5	when I lived in \[ Washington , \+ uh , Washington , D C *T*-1 , \] I never went to the Washington Memorial , E_S
21741:10	and then when I went back *-1 to visit *T*-2 , I went to the Washington Memorial . E_S
21747:5	when they go *T*-1 , it 's on business E_S
21765:24	\[ But our child- , \+ but when we go with our children *T*-1 \] we usually kind of stay close . E_S
21777:5	when I was eleven *T*-1 I went also to the Caribbean . E_S
21785:7	so when I was like fourteen , fifteen *T*-1 , \[ I went , \+ I went \] to Turkey . E_S
21808:9	But , what *T*-1 happens is 0 we used *-2 to fight a lot , E_S
21818:35	because , uh , my dad died , you know , when I was less than a year old *T*-1 E_S
21823:22	So I always thought , 0 when I have kids *T*-2 , you know , I really want *-1 to be involved *-1 with them . E_S
21857:89	because , you know , um , everything \[ that he taught me *T*-3 , \+ you know , that my family taught me *T*-1 , \] which is very hard *-2 to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say , I 'm sorry , you know . E_S
21859:35	and * let 's go out and do things together when I do n't feel like it *T*-1 , you know E_S
21866:5	when his little girl was five years old and everything *T*-2 , \[ they , \+ uh , they \] would *-1 go to the beach , E_S
21875:16	it does n't matter what age you have *T*-1 , E_S
21880:19	but \[ his , \+ what he \] does *T*-1 is , 0 when he gets home *T*-2 , he separates his work from his house . E_S
21880:45	but \[ his , \+ what he \] does *T*-1 is , 0 when he gets home *T*-2 , he separates his work from his house . E_S
21901:41	my theory is , you know , 0 \[ when , \+ when \] you have kids and all *T*-1 \[ you , \+ you \] want *-2 to do , well , N_S
21902:5	what I 'll do *T*-1 is , you know , like , N_S
21920:20	and * let 's see how we can get rid *-1 of the problem *T*-2 , you know , E_S
21957:11	that 's how I keep *-2 looking at it *T*-1 . E_S
21962:4	what is it *T*-1 , two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester . E_S
21969:23	\[ what does it , \+ what does it \] cost *T*-1 . E_S
21989:4	What are you learning *-2 to be *T*-1 ? E_S
21993:28	\[ What degree , \+ I mean , what \] are you wanting *-1 to do *T*-2 after you get out of college ? E_S
22037:32	and \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] what *T*-1 happened to my brother . E_S
22039:10	and then when he went down there *T*-1 , E_S he was just so bad off , you know from *-2 not being able *-3 to stay up here that his life just went down the drain . E_S
22075:38	the subject \[ is , \+ is \] big city crime , which *T*-1 is something that I do n't have any first hand experiences about *T*-2 , E_S
22077:31	and I have a few ideas of , um , how * to combat it *T*-1 . E_S
22122:103	in fact , for a while there they had downtown if you were *-1 to come to a stop light , they had a rash of \[ where people were , \+ when people were \] stopped at stop signs *T*-2 that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up . E_S
22123:23	So now , ever since then , when you drive into the city *T*-1 , most people keep their doors locked while they 're in the car , until they get down there , E_S
22124:47	and once you 've reached \[ the , \+ the \] river walk area , which *T*-1 is the tourist area , it 's usually pretty safe during the day , if you 're just kind of cautious and do n't go down the back streets or alleys , \[ and , \+ \] um , you know , or alone . E_S
22125:35	If you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the river patrol cops *T*-1 , it 's very nice . E_S
22126:84	But \[ at , \+ at \] evening , um , again , \[ you , \+ they \] have the high tourist area , the river walk area , which *T*-1 is nice , E_S
22164:29	Um , in San Antonio I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
22170:32	Um , then again , I do n't know really what steps *ICH*-2 there are *T*-1 that they , N_S
22172:27	Well , \[ what they , \+ what they \] say 0 they try *-1 to do *T*-2 is * to get the kids , um , early and *-3 young . E_S
22176:7	And what we have *T*-2 here in Burlington , which *T*-1 it does n't cost a lot of money , but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids *T*-3 . E_S
22230:5	When you have five thousand troubled youths *T*-1 , plus when you 're getting into \[ th- , \+
22230:33	When you have five thousand troubled youths *T*-1 , plus when you 're getting into \[ th- , \+
22261:16	I do n't know how you combat that *T*-1 . E_S
22262:31	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know where you start \[ or , \+ \] with a lot of these kids *T*-1 , E_S
22294:18	And I do n't know how you combat that *T*-1 . E_S
22296:16	I do n't know what the answer *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 to that problem , you know . E_S
22310:6	And what do those kids do *T*-1 , E_S
22312:4	what do they do *T*-1 then . E_S
22314:16	I do n't know how * to make it better for them *T*-1 E_S
22320:5	when they 're ten *T*-1 , they have *-2 to live in it , E_S
22335:38	and I 'm not good enough *-1 to raise my child , which *T*-2 basically is true E_S
22354:23	it was just a matter of who *T*-1 was shot *-2 that night , E_S
22376:5	When we moved here to Monterrey *T*-1 it was a big change , because it 's such a small community , E_S
22381:16	there 's Celinas which *T*-1 is about a fifteen minute drive , which *T*-2 is mostly migrant workers , E_S
22381:42	there 's Celinas which *T*-1 is about a fifteen minute drive , which *T*-2 is mostly migrant workers , E_S
22406:68	but they 're not going *-1 to grab you , steal \[ you- , \+ your \] money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities N_S
22413:19	I mean that 's what \[ you , \+ you 're \] going *-1 to have *-2 to expect *T*-3 that to happen . E_S
22430:43	\[ I , \+ I \] used *-1 to fish , uh , when I was real young *T*-2 , down in Galveston with my parents , E_S
22432:22	and I did n't know anybody who *T*-1 had a boat now , E_S
22449:4	What 'd you do *T*-1 with them ? E_S
22479:115	so , I have not done , uh , much \[ freshwater fishing oh , for , \+ you know , \[ lake , \+ lake \] fishing for \] bass and so forth but , uh , maybe some what they call *T*-1 brim and those sorts of things , but nothing , N_S
22535:33	or \[ do you , \+ do you \] eat what you fish *T*-1 . E_S
22541:26	\[ I used , \+ uh , when I was , uh , working in Florida *T*-1 , I used \] *-2 to do a lot of surf fishing mostly for relaxation E_S
22548:25	you know , there are people who *T*-1 fish , E_S
22549:20	and then there are people who *T*-1 catch . E_S
22609:34	\[ We , \+ I \] was the only one who *T*-1 did not catch , a single fish E_S
22666:11	Of course what I used *-1 to like *-2 to do *T*-3 though is * go *-4 snorkeling for scallops *ICH*-5 in some of the bays , \[ or \+ uh , or \] \[ oy- , \+ for oysters . \] E_S
22673:41	And , uh , that I was able *-1 to do *T*-2 , when I could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom *T*-3 . E_S
22682:80	The weirdest fishing experience 0 I ever had *T*-1 . People to this day are still trying *-2 to figure out if I really caught what I think 0 I caught *T*-3 . E_S
22683:27	We were in , uh , Rockport , which *T*-1 is close to Corpus E_S
22710:32	\[ I , \+ I \] had no idea what it was *T*-1 . E_S
22713:19	but the rock itself is what it had grabbed *T*-1 . E_S
22745:11	That 's where it gets its name *T*-1 , obviously , huh . E_S
22782:42	and the first thing 0 I caught *T*-1 was a sand shark , which *T*-2 was probably a foot , and a half or , uh , two feet long , E_S
22805:4	How do you feel about them *T*-1 , I mean , since you 've kind of been close to that . E_S
22818:38	My , um , dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother could n't take care of him *T*-1 E_S
22851:17	I have a sister-in-law who *T*-1 runs a nursing home , E_S
22856:35	and I know that she 's the kind of person who *T*-1 would n't allow , you know , a lot of the horror things *ICH*-3 to take place that you hear about *T*-2 . E_S
22903:17	but I think 0 when the time comes *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] hope *-2 to have the time 0 * to really look around , you know and pick one that I really think 0 my mother would be happy at *T*-3 *T*-4 . E_S
22920:21	There 's one close to where my mother is *T*-1 , E_S
22929:47	But then if you deteriorate , um , they have a separate section for those who *T*-1 need care you know , all the time . E_S
22945:43	but then , you do n't want *-1 to go *-3 do that when you do n't have *-4 to *?* *T*-5 because like , uh , you have *-2 to give up your automobile or whatever . E_S
22981:67	and , uh , \[ what I , \+ another thing 0 I \] hate *-1 to see *T*-2 is when someone has a small amount of money , and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately *T*-3 . E_S
22985:11	But those who *T*-1 do n't have money can go in and get the same care . You know . E_S
23006:21	You know , that 's how I feel about it *T*-1 , anyway . E_S
23059:21	But I really do n't know what the other solution would be *T*-1 you know , E_S
23065:5	when the time comes *T*-1 \[ I 'm really , \+ hopefully we 'll really \] look around before I decide on one for my parents E_S
23075:41	And I do n't think 0 they 'd want *-1 to go where they used *-2 to work *T*-3 , either you know . E_S
23104:7	So what do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S
23105:4	How are we doing in recycling *T*-1 ? E_S
23110:21	They have programs *ICH*-1 around where you can reach the , uh , N_S
23155:22	but that 's the extent of what I 've done *T*-1 . E_S
23157:110	The problem is , with a lot of it is , 0 \[ you have * to go , \+ \] you know , it takes a while * to drive to these places where you recycle it *T*-1 , you know E_S
23166:14	I can imagine what it 's like *T*-1 up there . E_S
23169:18	I 'm not exactly sure where \[ the , \+ you know , the \] can thing is *T*-1 , E_S
23206:19	and I do n't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have *T*-1 up there , E_S
23287:7	and what it is *T*-1 is a recycled paper bag E_S
23316:16	I do n't know what New York does *T*-1 about theirs . E_S
23332:53	But , you 're right 0 sometimes it does seem like it 's more trouble than what it would be worth *T*-1 . E_S
23371:6	But what do you do *T*-1 with them in the meantime ? E_S
23378:4	who *T*-1 does . E_S
23491:40	and he had his pockets full of stuff , you know , when he was caught *-1 *T*-2 E_S
23509:73	Maybe this pre group of people could decide , you know , \[ which kind of , \+ uh , you know , where they could go *T*-1 \] from there . E_S
23515:55	or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try *-1 to figure out what *T*-3 really happened . You know , a jury like that . E_S
23522:26	You know , kind of MUMBLEx off what we 've been talking about *T*-1 here , uh , I believe that \[ our , \+ \] we 've become almost a litigious society where \[ we , \+ everyone \] is very quick *-2 to sue or to threaten *-2 to sue and that kind of stuff *T*-3 , E_S
23522:104	You know , kind of MUMBLEx off what we 've been talking about *T*-1 here , uh , I believe that \[ our , \+ \] we 've become almost a litigious society where \[ we , \+ everyone \] is very quick *-2 to sue or to threaten *-2 to sue and that kind of stuff *T*-3 , E_S
23568:14	I 'd forgotten what that 's called *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
23571:9	Um , what is that called *-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
23593:99	Uh , I guess 0 the Lord started out with , \[ we 'll treat you fa- , \+ I 'll treat you fairly \] there as long as you do what I say *T*-1 . E_S
23600:73	I did a Sunday school lesson *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament \[ where , \+ where \] there 's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there 's a loving Lord in the New Testament *T*-3 . E_S
23623:17	\[ What , \+ what \] part of the country are you from *T*-1 ? E_S
23663:4	What are some of your favorite foods *T*-1 ? E_S
23674:30	\[ We got , \+ we got \] what some people call *T*-1 the best beef in the world . E_S
23687:60	\[ I 've had , \+ I 've had \] that meal *ICH*-2 in New York , uh , where they bring you a plank , sort of , with all this wonderful beef parts of beef , cooked and barbecued * *T*-1 E_S
23713:20	You ever serve that yourself when you have company *T*-1 ? E_S
23720:25	but \[ like , \+ like \] when I 'm down at home *T*-1 E_S
23724:37	and like somebody says okay , \[ when are , \+ when are \] we having this *T*-1 , you know , E_S
23730:38	and then , you know , you put all these different meats which *T*-1 take different times . E_S
23737:7	but what *T*-1 happens is 0 in Argentina they have like all these little places like the fruit stand , and , you know , the dairy , and products and whatever , E_S
23758:37	\[ What do you , \+ \[ what other , \+ what dishes \] do you \] serve *T*-1 with it ? E_S
23760:23	Well , basically , it 's , what we call *T*-1 it impenadas \[ which *T*-2 is , \+ which *T*-3 is , \] like , N_S
23760:66	Well , basically , it 's , what we call *T*-1 it impenadas \[ which *T*-2 is , \+ which *T*-3 is , \] like , N_S
23779:10	And then what you have *T*-1 is also \[ like , \+ you know , like \] three different kinds of salad . E_S
23785:14	Do you remember when you were in Washington *T*-1 , Sam the Argentine baker ? E_S
23813:31	And , uh , \[ what I , \+ what I \] also eat *T*-1 now , since I graduate , N_S
23834:34	and my mom , you know , like makes like what we call *T*-1 niokes , and all this stuff , that *T*-2 it 's \[ just , you know , everything \+ like lasagna and everything . \] E_S
23912:33	it 's like , \[ when you , \+ when you \] go *-1 buy fish *T*-2 , you know E_S
23961:18	um , do you know what hoi sin sauce is *T*-1 , E_S
23998:30	Uh , \[ how much , \+ uh , how much \] pork do you buy *T*-1 for two people . E_S
24035:6	And how much does it cost *T*-1 ? E_S
24078:27	well , E_S the first thing , N_S uh , what do you think 0 you would offer *T*-1 as far as , uh , information about * selecting a school ? E_S
24080:82	Well , first I think 0 they 've got *-1 to have a pretty good idea of \[ what they want *-2 to , \+ what they want *-3 to \] do *T*-4 . E_S
24084:142	Uh , once they have that , then they can start *-1 looking in all the various publications that *T*-2 give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves , and start *-1 finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind \[ of , \+ uh , of \] job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer *T*-3 . E_S
24088:40	depending upon the field , I know 0 there are some fields which a person should go to \[ the school , \+ that school , \] all four years *T*-1 , E_S
24089:29	but I know 0 there are some fields where it 's really not necessary *T*-1 . E_S
24098:98	Um , \[ if , \+ you know , if \] they want *-1 to get a liberal arts degree , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know what advice I 'd give them *T*-2 . E_S
24103:11	That 's what I did *T*-1 . E_S
24108:11	I went where I wanted *-1 to go *T*-2 . E_S
24111:4	What was your degree in *T*-1 ? E_S
24121:4	Where are you at *T*-1 ? E_S
24133:11	That 's where Texas Instruments is *T*-1 . E_S
24164:23	Um , E_S I did n't know what I wanted *-1 to do *T*-2 after I got \[ my , \+ my \] degree . E_S
24180:19	* Have n't figured out what I want *-1 to be *T*-2 when I grow up *T*-3 . E_S
24180:43	* Have n't figured out what I want *-1 to be *T*-2 when I grow up *T*-3 . E_S
24185:40	I mean , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] where I wanted *-1 to be *T*-2 , E_S
24191:98	And I 've since discovered that I would be far better off *-1 being in the paralegal field . Because that 's the nuts and bolts of the law , and that 's what I like *T*-2 , E_S
24199:32	So \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] what I 'm pursuing *T*-1 right now E_S
24207:73	\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] pursuing \[ \[ what they , \+ what *T*-1 's , \] \+ what *T*-2 's \] called *-3 an interdisciplinary field . E_S
24221:73	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] actually turning out *-1 to be \[ more , \+ more \] useful than what I thought *T*-2 . E_S
24233:47	The only field 0 I 'm not familiar with *T*-1 really is education , which \[ is required , \+ *T*-2 MUMBLEx requires \] about four or five different fields really . E_S
24241:36	but \[ I , \+ I \] quickly dispelled that idea when I became a substitute teacher for a while , * just to get my feet wet *T*-2 . E_S
24323:4	what 's *T*-1 going *-2 to happen when she gets there *T*-3 . E_S
24323:27	what 's *T*-1 going *-2 to happen when she gets there *T*-3 . E_S
24381:4	What branch were you in *T*-1 ? E_S
24385:4	What branch were you in *T*-1 ? E_S
24401:16	\[ what , \+ what \] was your job *T*-1 ? E_S
24444:21	I think 0 that 's why , you know , children really need *-1 to think about the field 0 they 're \[ going * to , \+ going into *T*-2 , \] and I mean , spend a lot of serious reading \[ before they , \+ \] I mean , not just * thinking about *T*-3 . E_S
24467:56	I mean , \[ they , \+ they \] find out \[ whether , \+ \] just how much of a people person they are *T*-1 . E_S
24470:17	I found that out when I was in high school *T*-1 . E_S
24481:16	and I knew exactly what they were going *-1 to do *T*-2 and say *T*-2 . E_S
24487:89	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] hate , um , *-1 having *-2 to play such a nice guy . You know , especially when it 's all phony *T*-3 . Especially when you got some , uh , jerk coming in *T*-4 . E_S
24487:113	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] hate , um , *-1 having *-2 to play such a nice guy . You know , especially when it 's all phony *T*-3 . Especially when you got some , uh , jerk coming in *T*-4 . E_S
24499:67	\[ I 'm , \+ uh , I \] deal much better in research and books , and stuff like that which *T*-1 is why I 'm going *-2 to enjoy the paralegal field a lot *T*-3 . E_S
24499:78	\[ I 'm , \+ uh , I \] deal much better in research and books , and stuff like that which *T*-1 is why I 'm going *-2 to enjoy the paralegal field a lot *T*-3 . E_S
24510:73	For instance , jobs that *T*-1 require use of heavy machinery and things like that \[ where there 's , \+ where there 's , \] uh , endangerment to their own life and other people 's lives *T*-2 . E_S
24525:28	Well , \[ how do you , \+ how do you \] feel *T*-1 about , uh , companies drug testing prior to *-2 hiring ? E_S
24535:126	I think 0 your record should stand for itself . That , you know , if you 've been tested *-1 at other companies and you 've always come up *-4 negative or whatever , then I do n't see what the big deal is *T*-2 that they have *-3 to go to all the expense of *-6 testing you over and over and over *T*-5 . E_S
24549:39	And that 's probably my question is , \[ how , \+ how \] do you know 0 it 's done *-1 fairly *T*-2 . E_S
24563:32	Somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person does n't win anything , and tries and tries and tries *T*-1 . You know . E_S
24572:42	\[ \[ How 'd , \+ how did \] they , \+ how do they \] pick their people *T*-1 ? E_S
24612:102	\[ \[ and , \+ and \] it 's \+ and it 's \] based *-4 \[ on , \+ on \] a perception \[ that someone has *T*-3 \+ \] as how a drug user would behave *T*-2 when some drug users behave , uh , normal *T*-1 , uh , you know . E_S
24612:123	\[ \[ and , \+ and \] it 's \+ and it 's \] based *-4 \[ on , \+ on \] a perception \[ that someone has *T*-3 \+ \] as how a drug user would behave *T*-2 when some drug users behave , uh , normal *T*-1 , uh , you know . E_S
24617:9	And then how would you feel afterwards when you came up *-4 negative and , you know , your supervisor has accused you of *-1 using drugs *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
24617:25	And then how would you feel afterwards when you came up *-4 negative and , you know , your supervisor has accused you of *-1 using drugs *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
24629:5	What type of job do you have *T*-1 ? E_S
24665:60	so I do n't know if I was n't drug tested *-1 based on that or because the man who *T*-2 hired me did n't request the drug test , because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion . E_S
24711:21	but again , it depends on what job you 're in *T*-1 . E_S
24723:72	\[ But , \+ but \] see , they make that clear to them as they hire those guys \[ what , \+ what \] the drug testing schedule is *T*-1 . E_S
24801:59	Because they 're so far behind and so poorly staffed *-2 , half the time the teachers do n't know what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
24808:4	what we learned *T*-1 . N_S
24811:5	when I came down south for high school *T*-1 I was just repeating what I 'd already done *T*-2 . Because we were so far advanced . E_S
24811:45	when I came down south for high school *T*-1 I was just repeating what I 'd already done *T*-2 . Because we were so far advanced . E_S
24820:66	So , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] like the concept 0 they 've got *T*-1 now where they have more directed education *T*-2 , you know , E_S
24834:111	it 's like \[ if , \+ if \] your father owns a grocery store and you 're really interested in that , E_S there 's no reason that you should take college prep courses *T*-1 when you can get some general business courses in high school *T*-2 . E_S
24854:7	So when I went to my first year of tech school *T*-1 , I had a very easy time because our high school had \[ a , \+ a \] good program . E_S
24860:16	they do n't know what * to do *T*-1 , E_S
24885:14	I can see where that would n't be very good for \[ a , \+ a \] kid *T*-1 , you know , E_S
24909:60	and I 'm wondering if that 's going *-1 to have any effect , you know , on what you see *T*-2 now . E_S
24948:16	I do n't see where she 's going *-1 to have much time for them *T*-2 . E_S
24955:16	\[ who , \+ who *T*-1 's \] supposed *-2 to make the change ,
24957:4	where 's the money supposed *-1 to come from *T*-2 . E_S
24961:166	Actually , \[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it \] should be \[ a civic level , \+ the city level \] and \[ a , \+ a \] system level *ICH*-3 really 0 *T*-2 to find out *RNR*-4 , and \[ t- , \+ to \] see *RNR*-4 what they need *T*-1 and not overinflate it , E_S
24963:16	\[ what , \+ what \] do you advocate *T*-1 ,
24964:21	more taxes or better management of what they got *T*-2 ? E_S
24966:37	like , if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut *-1 back , and you 're getting raises every eighteen months *T*-3 you got *-2 to go now , hey , * wait a minute , E_S
24973:77	even though we 've , uh , enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years , N_S now we got eight percent , uh , unemployment when it used *-1 to be four or five *T*-2 . E_S
24987:59	\[ \[ It , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] all money based . E_S And what you can do *T*-1 unless you just get down to the parent level N_S
24989:4	Who *T*-1 knows , E_S
25019:44	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 I 'm getting what I should *?* *T*-1 , E_S
25048:4	why do you think 0 it , uh , sounds , N_S
25063:30	and there are going *-1 to be people who *T*-2 die because of it because they do n't understand , uh , you know , simple things from the amount of medicine 0 they should take *T*-3 to how fast they can drive *T*-4 and you know how far away something is *T*-5 E_S

25073:28	our people are n't going *-1 to understand what an amount of something is *T*-2 . E_S
25087:60	it seems almost like \[ there 's this , \+ \] it 's a peer pressure thing is why we keep *-1 wanting *-1 to do it *T*-2 is so we 'll look good to the other nations E_S
25088:106	because I think 0 \[ they , \+ \] that 's an area that the other nations , especially Europe , look down on us like oh , we 're just backward wayward children who *T*-1 still use this backward system , who *T*-2 have n't really attained it yet *T*-3 . E_S

25089:33	And I feel 0 it 's just pride of why they keep *-1 trying *-2 to push it on us *T*-3 . E_S
25112:26	and I 've had *-1 to work when I was designing packages for people *T*-2 , E_S
25136:20	or I do n't know how much of the you know , N_S
25144:43	and if we ca n't take it and use it easily , well , how can you put that on , like , elderly people and you know , just people that *T*-1 maybe just are n't blessed with \[ as , \+ as \] much sharpness and \[ ment- , \+ mental \] acuity *T*-2 , E_S
25161:7	even when I was in elementary school years ago *T*-1 \[ they were , \+ \] you know , we learned what a centimeter *ICH*-3 was *T*-2 and a decimeter and \[ the various , \+ you know basically the other \] alternate forms of measurements , things like that . E_S

25174:36	I think 0 it failed , too , E_S because like what you said *T*-1 \[ of just , \+ \]
25180:117	I mean if you look at the average family it 's , like , man , they barely have time 0 * to stop and get gas , much less * to try and figure out how much gas they 're really getting *T*-1 and do all this *T*-2 . E_S
25204:21	and the scientific community and places where it 's needed *-1 *T*-2 you know , that 's fine E_S
25241:13	And that 's what I think 0 we ought *-2 to do *T*-1 with the metric system . E_S
25261:11	You know what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
25336:24	that probably is a little bit under what it is *T*-1 for this time of year . E_S
25347:19	Well , I like it when it 's sort of a medium temperature , uh , maybe seventy-five to eighty , somewhere in there *T*-1 . E_S
25348:19	I do n't like it when it 's too cool or too warm *T*-1 . E_S
25349:39	I 'm much more apt *-1 to get things done *-2 when it 's at that sort of in between temperature *T*-3 . E_S
25357:7	And what that tells me *T*-1 , is that the summer weather is very predictable , that it does n't vary very much . E_S
25399:25	Sometimes they get those inversions , like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
25411:24	I just do n't move very well when it 's that cold *T*-1 . E_S
25551:72	I guess , 0 the first time 0 I played golf *T*-1 has been probably about eight or ten years ago now , when I was in college *T*-2 . E_S
25567:23	that 's back in South Dakota where I grew up *T*-1 E_S
25576:53	and then I 'll show them 0 we can play golf in the middle of winter when we ca n't do it back home *T*-1 . E_S
25580:46	We played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not *T*-1 . E_S
25588:58	\[ so . \+ But , \] \[ I , \+ uh , actually I \] picked it up when I was in high school *T*-1 , on the same as a P E course , you know , E_S
25593:5	when I got into the service *T*-1 I got into it E_S
25597:10	and now when I come out here *T*-1 I just kind of let it go , E_S
25703:13	and that 's what I 'm trying *-1 to get her ready for *T*-2 . E_S
25704:32	It 's going *-1 to start , well , when we change time back *T*-2 whenever that is *T*-3 next month , I guess , E_S
25704:52	It 's going *-1 to start , well , when we change time back *T*-2 whenever that is *T*-3 next month , I guess , E_S
25772:30	Any novice can pick up a club and learn how * to hold one *T*-1 and learn how * to do it *T*-2 and do it right . E_S
25772:55	Any novice can pick up a club and learn how * to hold one *T*-1 and learn how * to do it *T*-2 and do it right . E_S
25788:26	and in the meantime , * just enjoy what you 're doing *T*-1 . E_S
25794:27	And \[ when , \+ you know when \] I first got back into it *T*-2 , I used *-1 to get mad because I knew 0 I could do something E_S
25909:13	you know when you graduate from college *T*-1 they 'll send you all those credit card applications you know , E_S
25964:13	Uh , back when I had my business *T*-1 I got one . E_S
25997:6	So what is it *T*-1 now ? E_S
26006:4	What do you mean *T*-1
26013:11	But then , what 's the interest *T*-1 ? E_S
26022:45	well , of course on the green card you have *-1 to pay it when the bill comes in *T*-2 ,
26028:50	\[ It 's actually , \+ it 's \] about sixteen and a half percent , which *T*-1 is pretty good , as far as credit cards go . E_S
26081:4	What are you saying *T*-1 ? E_S
26089:14	Maybe that 's how we got in trouble *T*-1 . E_S
26099:26	Well , it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic *T*-1 . E_S
26133:4	What is that thing 0 I saw *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
26158:11	I remember when they first opened up *T*-1 . E_S
26185:5	what else can we talk about *T*-1 ? E_S
26186:4	Who do you work for *T*-1 ? E_S
26205:4	Where are you going to school *T*-1 ? E_S
26209:4	What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S
26218:6	So where are you *T*-1 ? E_S
26220:4	Where am I *T*-1 ? E_S
26224:4	What do you mean *T*-1 , where ? E_S
26224:22	What do you mean *T*-1 , where ? E_S
26240:6	So what are you getting your degree in *T*-1 ? E_S
26244:6	And what do you do *T*-1 with it ? E_S
26248:9	Well , what is it *T*-1 ? E_S
26250:60	\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] really * looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them *T*-1 . E_S
26275:17	but I B M is what I 'm looking at *T*-1 right now . E_S
26287:60	as a matter of fact , the I B M \[ right here , \+ or in Carey , \] which *T*-1 is a little suburb of Raleigh , \[ just , \+ just \] hired one more human factors person . E_S
26295:5	How much longer do you have *T*-1 ? E_S
26322:8	so what kind of car are you thinking about *-1 getting *T*-2 ? E_S
26326:10	Well , when you decide *-2 to *?* *T*-1 . E_S
26374:70	But , uh , um , I finally decided *-1 to go *-2 check out \[ what the , \+ uh , what the , \] uh , foreign cars were *T*-3 . E_S
26409:15	you 're talking when you think about price *T*-1 , it 's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines . E_S
26451:36	\[ I had , \+ I have \] a friend who , uh , *T*-1 has \[ a , \+ uh , an \] auto shop , E_S
26478:51	and if there 's something out there that , uh , *T*-1 is comparable to what I have *T*-2 now , I 'll go ahead and get it . E_S
26503:36	Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] ca n't remember what the name is *T*-1 . E_S
26504:31	It 's the thirty-five or forty thousand dollar one , whatever it is *T*-1 , E_S
26525:11	that 's how expensive they were *T*-1 . E_S
26542:76	I never have been *?* , since , you know , my parents had *-1 to force me to get my driver 's license when I was young *T*-2 when I was sixteen *T*-3 . E_S
26542:93	I never have been *?* , since , you know , my parents had *-1 to force me to get my driver 's license when I was young *T*-2 when I was sixteen *T*-3 . E_S
26547:10	Now , what I was , you know , N_S
26571:21	Well , it 's very easy when \[ you get a top- , \+ you get on a topic \] that , you know , you enjoy *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
26612:31	they did not specify , you know , exactly what young means *T*-1 . E_S
26632:7	and when you get people who *T*-1 have no desire *-2 to be there in the first place *T*-3 , I do n't think that they 're going *-4 to be serving anybody . E_S
26632:22	and when you get people who *T*-1 have no desire *-2 to be there in the first place *T*-3 , I do n't think that they 're going *-4 to be serving anybody . E_S
26641:59	So I think 0 it *EXP*-2 would be a good thing though , * to encourage other people who *T*-1 are n't even aware that they can do such a thing . to get out there and do so . E_S
26693:44	and most kids these days have gotten themselves into , uh , financial situations , where they have *-1 to be working all the time *T*-2 . E_S
26736:52	it has *-1 to be something that *T*-2 's voluntary . You know , which *T*-3 is pretty much the way 0 it is *T*-4 now . E_S
26740:63	I 'm not even really sure *ICH*-2 at this point in time , you know , \[ what , \+ what \] programs *T*-1 are out there . E_S
26756:22	and you 've a choice of where you want *-1 to go *T*-2 . E_S
26772:61	Most of them probably would n't do something like that . Although there are a lot of kids who *T*-1 would do it *-2 just to get away from their parents . E_S
26804:19	and I do n't know who *T*-1 's even proposing it , \[ or , \+ or \] how they plan on *-2 implementing it *T*-3 , if they do . E_S
26804:57	and I do n't know who *T*-1 's even proposing it , \[ or , \+ or \] how they plan on *-2 implementing it *T*-3 , if they do . E_S
26844:66	and , I think , that they could get some results from that , because there are a lot of people who *T*-1 are volunteer and community minded , E_S
26848:18	but they do n't know where * to go *T*-1 *-2 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] do anything . E_S
26875:31	Like I say , I do n't even know what programs *T*-1 \[ are , \+ are \] even ongoing now , you know . E_S
26923:60	\[ so , \+ but \] before I went through all of that I wanted *-1 to see how I was going *-2 to like it *T*-3 . E_S
26928:14	in Alabama , where I came from *T*-1 \[ they , \+ they \] allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree . E_S
26958:42	\[ But , \+ but , \] anyway , at the time that 's what I taught *T*-1 . E_S
26977:16	and so that 's what I got my certification in *T*-1 . E_S
27002:20	I 've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy *T*-1
27003:16	it does n't matter what you do *T*-2 .
27013:8	Back when I was going to school *T*-1 uh , you just did n't get away with the things 0 these kids get away with *T*-2 now . E_S
27034:23	And I asked him , uh , what are you doing *T*-1 with that ? E_S
27052:38	I think 0 I understood \[ what the , \+ what the \] kid was doing *T*-1
27061:21	Well , we had the problem when I was in , N_S with *-1 teaching , um , N_S
27082:23	I 've only had two instances where \[ I cou- , \+ \] it was really noticeable *T*-1 E_S
27083:18	but they were better behaved when they were , um , N_S
27119:16	and I 've seen how their school system works *T*-1 E_S
27140:37	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] a great deal what law school 's like *T*-1 . E_S
27146:10	Is that what you ended up *-2 going into *T*-1 ? E_S
27159:13	and it 's how well you can remember it all *T*-1 . E_S
27161:17	\[ How , \+ how \] much can you stuff *T*-1 in your brain . E_S
27202:4	What can we do *T*-1 about it ? E_S
27247:29	as much as I did n't like school when I was going through it *T*-2 , from my perspective now I can see that it 's a lot better than what we have *T*-1 now . E_S
27247:97	as much as I did n't like school when I was going through it *T*-2 , from my perspective now I can see that it 's a lot better than what we have *T*-1 now . E_S
27257:90	You know , I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] silly \[ that these , \+ that these \] people are handcuffed *-2 when it comes to discipline *T*-1 . E_S
27285:58	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] have n't fortunately been in a situation where it 's , been applicable to me *T*-1 E_S
27291:64	Well , \[ I think , \+ I think , \] 0 \[ I , \+ I \] mean what we 've turned the school schools into *T*-1 now are just day-care centers E_S
27322:16	I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
27328:4	how is Texas *T*-1 about * keeping your children out of public schools , E_S
27358:55	I remembering *-2 reading a few cases about \[ that \+ \[ when it , \+ when \] \] some people first tried that *T*-1
27406:14	you can see where those spackling marks were *T*-1 . E_S
27427:14	and I forgotten what it was *T*-1 0 you put *T*-2 down , and then you can just paint right over the dark . E_S
27449:30	although , \[ we sort of , \+ \] when we got through *T*-1 I wished 0 we had n't done it E_S
27458:13	Uh , particularly when you try *-1 to , N_S
27459:36	I was talking to somebody else \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 had a lot of wood panelling E_S
27467:53	\[ Have you , \+ have you \] tried *-1 getting outside estimates *-2 to see what it *EXP*-4 costs *T*-3 * to have something painted *-5 ? E_S
27470:15	Now , uh , when we bought the house that we live in *T*-1 right now *T*-3 we had a company that *T*-2 came out and painted it . E_S
27518:29	and , uh , it *EXP*-1 's just remarkable how close it will match the paint *T*-2 , uh , E_S
27547:26	That 's one of the problems though when you start *-3 painting *T*-2 * to try *-1 to get the , you know , N_S
27559:27	As a matter of fact , uh , what we 've got ours painted *-1 *-3 *T*-2 now is kind of a light creamy color and \[ a , \+ uh , a \] blue E_S
27574:6	so what 's your , N_S
27575:4	what 's the solution *T*-1 then ? E_S
27619:11	That 's what we 're trying *-1 to get ours to look like *T*-2 . E_S
27659:32	and she did that all the way around the room which *T*-1 makes it look very attractive , E_S
27663:54	but it makes the room look smaller \[ which *T*-1 is , \+ uh uh , which *T*-2 is , \] N_S
27669:28	it explains \[ why they , \+ why they \] have everything white *T*-1 E_S
27698:19	we did n't know that when we bought the house *T*-1 E_S
27716:27	it kind of bled under the masking tape which , I guess , *T*-1 is probably the topic 0 \[ we 're \+ we 're \] really on to *T*-2 \[ that , \+ that \] the masking is , N_S
27754:23	Um , I 'm not quite sure why that is *T*-1 E_S
27756:29	but I guess 0 I got away from what I consider *T*-1 to be the pot , uh , sounding music . E_S
27757:52	It did n't have \[ what , \+ you know , I guess 0 *T*-2 what \] I was looking for *T*-1
27762:5	When you say that you grew up , uh , in the sixties *T*-1 I take it 0 that was the , uh , teenage type years E_S
27777:45	um , essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which *T*-1 meant that \[ I , \+ for one reason or another I \] did n't pay much attention to music , E_S
27779:37	uh , my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel , whom I saw *T*-1 perform when I was in college *T*-2 E_S
27779:55	uh , my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel , whom I saw *T*-1 perform when I was in college *T*-2 E_S
27795:11	I know what I like *-1 to listen to *T*-2 as far as classical music . E_S
27805:37	and \[ I , \+ I 've \] enjoyed the times when I have listened to it *T*-1 . E_S
27810:7	but when I do play , uh , and begin *-4 to reacquire skills *T*-5 I inevitably fall in love with country western music which *T*-1 tends *-2 to be in some ways easy 0 * to play *T*-3 \[ for a , \+ for a \] new piano player . E_S
27810:76	but when I do play , uh , and begin *-4 to reacquire skills *T*-5 I inevitably fall in love with country western music which *T*-1 tends *-2 to be in some ways easy 0 * to play *T*-3 \[ for a , \+ for a \] new piano player . E_S
27820:52	I was influenced *-1 by all different kinds of music E_S but basically because that 's where I worked *T*-1 . E_S
27825:49	One of things 0 I especially like *T*-2 now in music regardless of what kind it is *T*-1 , uh , are those that *T*-3 call on those classical , uh , roots , I guess 0 *T*-4 ,
27839:16	I do n't know which *T*-1 is chicken and egg in that situation . E_S
27861:90	\[ I , \+ I , \] uh , spent my \[ junior year , \+ uh , and sophomore and junior \] year \[ in , \+ in \] college when I , N_S
27867:22	uh , and if you recall how it goes downtown , ta , da , da , da *T*-1 , E_S
27888:4	When did you first take your , uh , first piano lesson *T*-1 ? E_S
27895:23	I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes *T*-1 E_S
27907:78	and then I inevitably discover that I have no innate music talent relative to composition and that I struggle and really ca n't quite understand what is *T*-1 that other people take *T*-2 for granted , in composition themes E_S
27912:50	keys and things are something *ICH*-1 to me that *T*-2 remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang *T*-3 on them . E_S
27913:27	I have a pretty good mathematical concept for what *T*-1 's involved , E_S
27917:75	uh , but \[ in a , \+ in a \] innate music sense there just seems *-1 to be something missing * there which *T*-2 is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude E_S
27927:29	they went through the , uh , parent thing where you 've got *-1 to practice or you 're not going out *-2 to play *T*-3 thing , E_S
27930:7	and when it came to my turn *T*-1 the folks said no we 're not going through that again , E_S
27932:50	and \[ is the \+ \] * turns out 0 I was the only one who *T*-1 really had an interest in it and never got *-2 to *?* , E_S
27978:38	I 'm going back too far , from my parents ' generation when mom stayed home *T*-1 , period N_S
27997:127	\[ There was not , \+ there 's not \] supposed *-1 to be any reason 0 * to use this education or this brain that you might have *T*-2 for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be *T*-3 on any given day *T*-4 . E_S
28007:53	\[ and , \+ and \] we have these wonderful people \[ who *T*-1 are \+ who *T*-2 are \] totally prepared *-3 \[ to tea- , \+ to teach \] your child everything 0 they need *-4 to know *T*-5 in day care E_S
28015:16	and we 'll see how the generations go *T*-1 . E_S
28020:45	at least for a lot of women depending \[ on , \+ on \] what she did *T*-1 . E_S
28051:40	You know , the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they 're going *-1 to be there *T*-2 . E_S
28067:10	Is that what you 're saying *T*-1 ? E_S
28071:4	What will you , N_S
28080:7	but when I went to college *T*-1 \[ it was , \+ I felt \] like I could n't support myself if I decided *-2 to be a photographer that it would just have *-3 to be a hobby , E_S
28106:159	and so \[ they 're getting , \+ they get \] the socialization with other kids , \[ and , \+ you know , and \] not really school , \[ but , \+ but \] a different authority than mom , once in a while , you know , kind of *-2 learning how * to deal with society *T*-1 . E_S
28150:12	that 's what I 'm doing *T*-1 , is * working part time because I can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the , uh , week and use those hours * to do . N_S
28165:48	or my husband , \[ if it 's , \+ you know , uh , when he 's \] at home *T*-1 , can take care of them . E_S
28177:128	Well , \[ so , \+ so \] that 's another thing that *T*-1 has *-2 to adapt is , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] father 's attitudes about , you know , \[ who , \+ whose \] job is this *T*-3 . E_S
28226:11	this is what you do *T*-1 it now . E_S
28255:37	And a lot of that \[ is , \+ is \] how it was drilled *-1 into you *T*-2 when you were a kid *T*-3 .
28255:63	And a lot of that \[ is , \+ is \] how it was drilled *-1 into you *T*-2 when you were a kid *T*-3 .
28256:4	Which *T*-4 brings us back to the idea , you know , 0 someone 's got *-5 to be there *-6 taking care of the kids *-6 to \[ drill in these \+ you know , drill in the \] right ideas to , so that they know that , uh , you know , male and female are both responsible for *-1 doing this E_S
28279:47	\[ you both got *-1 to , \+ they were both working at \] whatever things *T*-2 \[ were , \+ needed \] *-5 to be done *-4 . E_S
28297:65	But I think 0 in between we got \[ a group of kids , \+ a generation of kids \] who *T*-1 did n't learn *-2 to take responsibility because mom left *-3 to go *-4 get a job and dad did n't move in *-5 to fill the gap . E_S
28320:22	but the kids are basically doing what they want *T*-1 and not really having any relationship with the adults * to say , you know , here 's *T*-3 what *T*-2 's right E_S
28320:91	but the kids are basically doing what they want *T*-1 and not really having any relationship with the adults * to say , you know , here 's *T*-3 what *T*-2 's right E_S
28324:16	and here 's *T*-2 what *T*-1 wrong , E_S
28325:16	and here 's *T*-2 what we expect *T*-1 of you . E_S
28329:18	and I felt like when they were young *T*-1 , that was the time 0 *-2 to instill it *T*-5 . That \[ it could be , \+ it could be \] added to *-3 and strengthened *-3 as they grew older , but 0 when they were little *T*-4 , you know , N_S
28335:77	\[ \[ \[ when you , \+ when you , \] \+ if you , \] \+ if you \] teach them when they 're little *T*-1 the way 0 you want them to be *T*-2 , and the things that *T*-3 are important to you , then \[ you just , \+ you \] add onto it as they get older . E_S
28339:22	But if no one does anything when they 're little *T*-1 , then it 's twice as hard \[ as , \+ I think 0 *T*-2 , as \] they get older . E_S
28355:7	and when I was a child *T*-1 I did n't really know my dad very well , E_S
28397:4	What do you use *T*-1 ? E_S
28461:59	so I ended up *-1 taking on the load of *-2 making * sure 0 everybody knows what they 're doing *T*-3 E_S
28484:18	One of the reasons why I got mine *T*-1 , was 0 before I went on maternity leave , E_S they did n't know how they were going *-1 to do without me *T*-2 at work because , I am pretty much \[ the , \+ like you said , the \] guru , in the office with the different programs and MUMBLEx any trouble shooting that there is *T*-1 , E_S
28484:77	One of the reasons why I got mine *T*-1 , was 0 before I went on maternity leave , E_S they did n't know how they were going *-1 to do without me *T*-2 at work because , I am pretty much \[ the , \+ like you said , the \] guru , in the office with the different programs and MUMBLEx any trouble shooting that there is *T*-1 , E_S
28491:37	\[ and , \+ um , so \] they did n't know how it was going *-1 to work *T*-2 , E_S
28513:4	what 's the word 0 I 'm looking for *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
28540:16	Well , that 's what I do *T*-1 . E_S
28551:15	So the first thing when I started *-1 working at this bank *T*-2 , is , I said , well , now first of all we need *-3 to all be able *-4 to share this P C without *-4 getting up . E_S
28562:47	And we can \[ mail , \+ send mail \] messages to each other , which *T*-1 is good enough , E_S
28566:11	it 's what we need *T*-1 . E_S
28589:33	or I 've got my P C configured *-2 to where I can use either printer . The one that *T*-1 's on the network or my own *T*-3 . E_S
28622:16	I do n't remember what kind they were *T*-1 , E_S
28631:26	So they just want black and white , which MUMBLEx see we can just run *T*-1 them through the laser printer real quick . Because it *EXP*-2 will only take a minute * to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it . E_S
28677:14	I was amazed when I came to work *T*-1 , E_S
28694:18	And I could n't believe when I walked in the door on my first day *T*-3 and here 's *T*-2 the audit department of \[ this , \+ this \] huge holding company , *-1 sharing a H P Rugged Writer . E_S
28703:6	So how are you supposed *-1 to expect *-2 to stay number one when you 're behind the times in technology *T*-3 *T*-4 . E_S
28703:44	So how are you supposed *-1 to expect *-2 to stay number one when you 're behind the times in technology *T*-3 *T*-4 . E_S
28727:76	We find it \[ hard 0 * to believe *T*-2 *ICH*-4 sometimes , \+ or hard 0 * to understand *T*-1 \] when , uh , we work for a computer company *T*-3 , and , uh ,
28728:4	how are we supposed *-3 to present the imagine that we 're supposed *-4 to present *T*-7 with equipment \[ that *T*-5 's outdated , \+ That *T*-6 's obsolete *T*-8 \] E_S
28733:23	and it 's like , Well , why do we need this *T*-1 , E_S
28734:33	ca n't you do that with , you know , what we have *T*-1 , E_S
28744:22	Well , I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying *T*-2 as what was the topic *T*-1 . E_S
28744:46	Well , I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying *T*-2 as what was the topic *T*-1 . E_S
28750:4	why do n't you go first *T*-1 . E_S
28759:4	how old are you *T*-1 ? E_S
28802:77	I mean it *EXP*-1 's really hard * to find a place that *T*-2 's going *-3 to offer water aerobics because what I 'm finding *T*-5 is that if they do offer it , you get the crowd of women that *T*-4 are , , N_S
28816:45	Well , I mean , \[ if , \+ if \] you know what your routine is *T*-1 , you can do that by yourself , E_S
28824:27	So , * to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without , you know , * drawing a lot of looks *T*-2 , means 0 you 're really going *-1 to do a strenuous workout activity MUMBLEx E_S
28829:19	that was the one place where I was also able *-2 to do weight training *T*-1 , E_S
28854:5	when I workout in the mornings *T*-1 , I try *-2 to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center . E_S
28875:8	actually when I was working there *T*-2 I was the only woman that *T*-1 was pretty much in the industry , E_S
28905:7	Now what year are we talking about *T*-1 ? E_S
28924:26	\[ and \+ \] I tell you how much in the dark ages it was *T*-2 .
28927:5	when I became pregnant *T*-1 I also got meningitis , and then delivered the first baby three months early , E_S
28934:30	and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home *T*-1 , E_S
28948:58	and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one , because that 's when I go into labor MUMBLEx *T*-1 four and a half months E_S
28954:49	Of course it *EXP*-1 's real easy * to take care of the first one when you 're on your back *T*-2 . E_S
28959:92	and \[ they , \+ they \] put me on twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then * \[ to , \+ to \] try *-2 to control the labor and see how far it was going *T*-1 , E_S
28961:26	I think 0 that 's kind of when my husband hit the roof , because it was a , uh , thirteen thousand dollar bill *T*-1 , E_S
28969:13	and that was when they had , N_S
28974:19	and I 'll tell you how they handled this *T*-1 E_S
28979:14	and I said what the hell *T*-1 is going on here , you know . E_S
29017:5	how much *ICH*-1 is it a month ? E_S
29070:5	When you 're there on weekends *T*-1 is it crowded as hell ? E_S
29072:27	Uh , well , it would depend on when you go *T*-1 E_S
29112:38	Um , well , I , uh , have a four year old who *T*-1 will just be entering public school next year , E_S
29113:62	so I 'm really just starting *-1 to get involved *-2 \[ in , \+ uh , in \] what *T*-3 's out there and how they do things *T*-4 . E_S
29113:81	so I 'm really just starting *-1 to get involved *-2 \[ in , \+ uh , in \] what *T*-3 's out there and how they do things *T*-4 . E_S
29128:42	So , uh , I mean , \[ when you , \+ when you \] take , uh , uh , professionals and put them in situations , 0 they have *-1 to make decisions based * on money 0 * to fund public education *T*-3 *T*-2 *T*-4 , E_S
29132:20	they 're more serious about what the salary should be *T*-1 for senators than they are *?* for \[ what , \+ how \] the level of education should be *T*-2 for children . E_S
29132:73	they 're more serious about what the salary should be *T*-1 for senators than they are *?* for \[ what , \+ how \] the level of education should be *T*-2 for children . E_S
29157:142	I think 0 they get bogged *-1 down in a lot of small issues that \[ people , \+ you know , special interest groups \] can blow *T*-2 up , \[ and , \+ uh , and \] not really get down to * teaching what *T*-3 's important . E_S
29161:55	Teaching these kids 0 , you know , \[ how \+ \] MUMBLEx really the basics is what it comes down to *T*-1 . E_S
29168:117	\[ Ha- , \+ \] \[ \[ they do n't even , \+ a lot of the school systems do n't even , \] \+ uh , the kids nowadays do n't even \] know \[ what , \+ what \] the president 's fitness education program is all about *T*-1 , E_S
29172:68	they do n't have *-1 to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap 0 we had *-3 to do *T*-2 when we were going to school *T*-4 . E_S
29177:41	and , uh , I talked to a thirteen year old *ICH*-2 last night who *T*-1 \[ 's , \+ uh , goes \] to , uh , one of the Plano high schools or junior highs , I guess , E_S
29198:20	then it comes down to what you said *T*-1 before though about them being some of the lowest paid \[ public , \+ you know , public \] service , employees that there are *T*-2 , E_S
29203:53	\[ I used * to , \+ I used *-1 to \] date a girl who *T*-2 taught English at ninth grade level . E_S
29210:52	I mean , I was absolutely flabbergasted at \[ what , they wo- , \+ what she was \] paid *T*-1 . E_S
29261:4	Where do you get most of your news *T*-1 ? E_S
29266:16	\[ Where , \+ where \] are you *T*-1 ? E_S
29322:38	I will admit 0 I work with , uh , someone who *T*-1 's Iranian , E_S
29366:22	and they go back and forth , where everyone 's giving some opinions *T*-1 E_S
29385:8	Now when they started *-1 to speculate *T*-2 , \[ I , \+ I \] saw that for what is was *T*-3 , and thought 0 all of these guys do n't know what *T*-4 's going on . E_S
29385:62	Now when they started *-1 to speculate *T*-2 , \[ I , \+ I \] saw that for what is was *T*-3 , and thought 0 all of these guys do n't know what *T*-4 's going on . E_S

29390:35	\[ and , \+ and \] they shed some light on what *T*-1 was going on for me . E_S
29401:48	And they seemed *-1 to mold the events to their view of the world , which I suppose 0 just about everyone does *T*-2 , E_S
29421:28	and , uh , I was real impressed at how A B C handled , uh , *-1 translating , the war for children *T*-2 . E_S
29430:124	but there was \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] big push *ICH*-1 with the local T V stations * to have little hot lines with counselors * \[ to , \+ to \] help parents learn how *-2 to talk about their war with their children *T*-3 . E_S
29488:63	and \[ \[ I , \+ I \] was just , \+ I was \] horrified and fascinated *-2 by what I was seeing *T*-1 . E_S
29512:52	so \[ I , \+ I 'm \] pretty much limited *-2 to P B S , which \[ I thought , \+ I thought \] 0 *T*-1 they did a very good job . E_S
29522:74	We 've got the one \[ fairly , \+ well , relatively \] weaker paper , the TIMES HERALD , and then the MORNING NEWS , which *T*-1 has a very strong subscription . E_S
29593:5	What kinds of things have you done *T*-1 ? E_S
29652:9	Oh , what 's that *T*-1 ? E_S
29657:5	what kind of cloth *T*-1 uses that . E_S
29665:25	Like it could be a flame stitch where \[ so \+ \] rather than * drawing a picture you 're making a design like a geometric or whatever *T*-1 , E_S
29669:24	\[ What did you , \+ what kind of things did you \] do *T*-1 ? E_S
29671:5	What I did *T*-1 , when I was doing that *T*-2 was mostly pillows , you know , for sofas and so forth , E_S
29671:21	What I did *T*-1 , when I was doing that *T*-2 was mostly pillows , you know , for sofas and so forth , E_S
29683:22	I was so proud of them when I got them finished *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
29684:19	but I have no idea where they are *T*-1 . E_S
29686:4	What did you call that *T*-1 ? E_S
29702:16	I mean , when you described it *T*-1 , it sounded like something , you know , that *T*-2 would be around , I guess 0 *T*-3 . E_S
29719:4	How did you know *-1 to choose this subject , tonight *T*-2 . E_S
29722:4	how did you , N_S
29723:5	what kinds of decorations did you use *T*-1 with the bas- , N_S
29724:4	how were you decorating the baskets *T*-1 ? E_S
29731:29	so many of them now have the ribbons where , I 'm not sure how they do it *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
29731:47	so many of them now have the ribbons where , I 'm not sure how they do it *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
29734:16	I do n't know how *-1 to explain it *T*-2 . E_S
29760:5	When I do , um , crochet *T*-1 , it 's usually the lacy Victorian type things like that , E_S
29777:38	\[ That 's \+ I think 0 that 's \] what my concern was *T*-1 , was it really sure , and \[ how they would , \+ how they would \] last *T*-2 . E_S

29781:13	Do you know what my concern is *T*-1 ? E_S
29782:4	How will I dust this thing *T*-1 ? E_S
29807:33	So first thing 0 I think of *T*-1 is how easy *ICH*-4 would this , thing be *T*-2 0 * to clean *T*-3 . E_S
29826:19	But I really enjoy it when I do do it *T*-1 , when I get the chance *T*-2 , you know . E_S
29826:41	But I really enjoy it when I do do it *T*-1 , when I get the chance *T*-2 , you know . E_S
29846:11	That 's what I keep *-1 telling this person *T*-2 , E_S
29849:4	What was this project *T*-1 ? E_S

29901:34	\[ I , \+ I \] just do n't know when I 'm ever , N_S
29905:27	like I said I really enjoy it when I do *T*-1 . E_S
29930:19	and then I just use whatever colors I want *-1 to *?* *T*-2 . E_S
29935:31	And \[ it , \+ it \] depends on what it is *T*-1 , you know . E_S
29936:57	But some things , especially letters , if they suggest certain colors for letters , I just go with whatever I want *-1 to *?* *T*-2 . E_S
29938:11	That 's what I would do *T*-1 , too . E_S
29943:7	Or whatever I have *T*-1 . E_S
29980:4	How do you feel *T*-1 about credit cards ? E_S
29983:87	\[ I , \+ I \] try *-1 to refrain from their use as much as possible . Um , for a number of reasons , one of which *T*-2 is the , you know , extreme interest rate on most of them . E_S
30013:55	Well , \[ we , \+ uh , me and my wife , \] \[ when , \+ when \] we have like extra money that we know 0 we 're going *-1 to have *T*-2 , and we can put it in our budget *T*-3 , yeah , \[ we 'll , \+ we 'll \] use it . E_S
30051:14	That 's usually how we do it *T*-1 . E_S
30053:40	I know 0 \[ when I travel *T*-1 , \+ or when I used *-2 to travel overseas quite a bit *T*-3 , \] what I would do *T*-4 on my American Express card is \[ before I would , \+ before I left \] I would mail a check \[ to , \+ to \] American Express and , you know , have some idea of how much *T*-5 was there , you know ,

30054:41	I 'd sent them , you know , several hundred dollars , or whatever I felt 0 I would spend *T*-6 . And then use it then . E_S
30101:28	Plus \[ I would , \+ uh , when they , uh , would \] send the bill *T*-1 , they would automatically convert to the exchange rate . E_S
30110:44	Uh , for example , I remember 0 on one trip to France when I started *-1 planning the trip *T*-2 , I think , uh , a dollar was worth nine or ten E_S francs and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc , drastically . E_S
30114:19	And \[ whe- , \+ when \] I finally got over there *T*-1 , it had fallen , uh , two or three francs to the dollar . E_S
30133:36	It would average out to thirty-five or forty dollars a night which *T*-1 is a reasonable rate . E_S
30170:12	Well , from where are you calling *T*-1 ? E_S
30192:16	Um . I wonder how T I got G T E involved *T*-1 . E_S
30204:9	So , when I heard that Jack was going *-1 to do this *T*-2 , I called him and asked for an application where I could participate in this *T*-3 . E_S
30204:75	So , when I heard that Jack was going *-1 to do this *T*-2 , I called him and asked for an application where I could participate in this *T*-3 . E_S
30209:18	And , so that 's how I got involved *T*-1 . E_S
30213:4	what 's the word *T*-1 . E_S
30264:4	how are you *T*-1 today ? E_S
30285:4	What do you have *T*-1 , at home ? E_S
30302:22	It 's probably pretty close to what I have *T*-1 , because I have the same kind of thing at work . E_S
30303:23	I have a three eighty-six S X which *T*-1 is T I computer , E_S
30308:11	that 's what we have *T*-1 . Um . E_S
30332:14	I was amazed when I took our taxes to our tax person *T*-1 E_S
30380:92	You know , she always seems *-3 to have better things 0 *-4 to do *T*-1 than *-4 to try *-5 to sit down and figure out how * to use her computer *T*-2 you know . E_S
30483:16	So I can see where it would be a great advantage * to have one at home , you know , if you were going to school *T*-1 . E_S
30498:41	and I could n't imagine *-2 not having that thing on a disk where I could go back in and move stuff around and change it *T*-1 . E_S
30502:31	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what they used *-1 to do *T*-2 before they , N_S
30546:21	You know , I remember when I was working in high school *T*-1 , you know ,
30554:10	then , when , \[ where , \+ \] you know , someone would have you type a letter *T*-1 , \[ they did it right , \+ they did it right . \] E_S
30561:24	and they go , is this really what I want *-2 to say *T*-1 , E_S
30568:31	Well , we 'll try this out and see what it looks like *T*-1 . E_S
30575:17	instead of * knowing what they want *-1 to say *T*-2 before \[ they eve- , \+ they just , \] you know , play with it , \[ and , \+ which \] in a way *-3 is nice * to be able 0 * to do *T*-4 , E_S

30580:46	I 've seen it get out of hand up here , you know where we 've got a secretary that *T*-1 sits over here that *T*-4 's keeping metrics right now , and keeping up , you know , of all the letters 0 I type *T*-2 , \[ how many cha- , \+ how many \] of them *T*-6 do I make changes on *T*-3 .

30587:56	And , you know , she 's also keeping \[ a percentage , \+ you know , what percentage \] of letters am I retyping *T*-1 for whatever reason . E_S
30591:48	And there 's like one week , 0 she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed *T*-1 you know , E_S
30597:22	but it 's running about seventy which *T*-1 is still ridiculous * to have *-3 to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types *T*-2 . E_S
30628:8	Especially when they 're in school *T*-1 , I think 0 *T*-2 they would get a lot out of it . E_S
30636:7	and when we were in high school *T*-1 it was always fun . E_S
30638:24	and I do n't even remember now what it was called *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
30644:31	and you 'd type in du du du , Hi how are you *T*-1 , du du du , E_S
30668:7	But when you 're doing the guilty father complex *T*-1 , you know , because he 's not there *-2 to watch us grow , you can kind of get all kinds of stuff . E_S
30716:18	And I ca n't believe how good they 're getting *T*-1 with their animation now . E_S
30745:44	\[ Latest , \+ latest \] one 0 I 've saw *T*-1 which *T*-2 was a mistake *-3 to go *-4 see was LIONHEART , E_S
30768:11	You know how they can make \[ any of , \+ any single one of \] them in a movie to be a \[ super \+ superstar \] of any sort *T*-1 , you know , E_S
30790:35	It was about , uh , a , French Foreign Legion fellow who *T*-1 deserts *-2 to go *-3 help his brother 's wife \[ who *T*-4 got , \+ who *T*-5 became \] a widow because he was selling drugs , E_S
30790:94	It was about , uh , a , French Foreign Legion fellow who *T*-1 deserts *-2 to go *-3 help his brother 's wife \[ who *T*-4 got , \+ who *T*-5 became \] a widow because he was selling drugs , E_S
30802:47	and then he moves on to L A to \[ where that , \+ where she \] is *T*-1 *-2 to just help him out . E_S
30840:20	Uh , I guess 0 what *T*-1 made it so good was the \[ cinema- , \+ cinematography , \] E_S
30862:9	but then what movie *T*-1 is n't *?* anymore . E_S
30888:29	And even on those type they do n't show what you expect *T*-1 . E_S
30937:42	I read about how they did , uh , an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine *T*-1 . E_S
30967:9	Huh . What 's that about *T*-1 ? E_S
30969:21	A , uh , special effects man who somehow *T*-1 gets involved *-2 in this , um , N_S
30975:39	and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in *-1 doing what *T*-2 needs *-3 to be done *-4 . E_S
30995:14	* To understand what *T*-1 's going on in the second ? E_S
31019:97	and they just change the title \[ and , \+ uh , and \] reshot a few parts , you know , \[ where they , \+ yeah , you know , where they \] could *?* *T*-1 . E_S
31042:28	they probably do the story of someone who *T*-1 was shot *-2 down early in the war or something and how he survived *T*-3 \[ \[ or , \+ or about , \] \+ or about \] those two newsmen or whatever that *T*-4 got captured *-5 . E_S

31059:7	Or what you read *T*-1 . E_S
31099:97	But , uh , *-2 being one of these late in life mothers , I 've listened to everybody else 's , you know , complaints as to \[ wha- , \+ what *T*-1 's \] the matter with either their kids or the school system . E_S
31115:202	And , uh , you know , \[ I , \+ I 've , \] in hindsight , seen some things that I wished that , you know , I had done something about *T*-1 that *T*-3 was , you know , within my power or , uh , you know , wish that in some ways we , as parents , had more control over what *T*-2 's happening up there , you know , type thing . E_S
31157:19	And even if I knew how * to teach the subject matter *T*-1 , I do n't know if I 'd know how * to handle that kind of \[ a , \+ a \] group of kids *T*-2 . E_S
31157:69	And even if I knew how * to teach the subject matter *T*-1 , I do n't know if I 'd know how * to handle that kind of \[ a , \+ a \] group of kids *T*-2 . E_S
31160:154	In fact , I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] one of the big problems today is \[ the , \+ the \] way 0 the kids behave or act *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and \] the way 0 they are sometimes disinterested in what *T*-1 's going on in the class and disruptive *T*-3 . E_S
31162:14	I tell you what I 'm finding *T*-1 frightening E_S
31174:5	What I 'm seeing *T*-1 now , uh , in terms of kindergarten preparedness , just from , \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ in \] different preschools it 's like day and night . E_S
31178:15	And I wonder , how do they handle a child who *T*-1 is obviously very ready and another child who *T*-2 does n't even speak English , let alone know her colors *T*-3 . E_S

31184:40	My God , I think 0 it would be next year is what I 'd read *T*-1 . E_S
31185:37	I thought , well , \[ how do you , \+ how do you \] weed those out *T*-1 ? E_S
31193:4	When I was listening to N P R , the National Public Radio *T*-1 , N_S
31204:59	\[ And I , \+ and \[ I , \+ I \] \] got to *-3 thinking back when I was teaching college chemistry *T*-1 ,

31220:117	At the same time you think , God , I hope 0 I do n't sound like a stage mother because , right now if you ask my friends t- , put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many *T*-2 have gifted children , you 're going *-1 to have twenty hands , you know , up there . E_S
31231:38	\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] not a kid who *T*-1 's , you know , precocious . E_S

31253:16	And she told me what she had requested *T*-1 . E_S
31260:39	And I thought , well now , here you have a student who *T*-1 is trying *-3 to pass , who *T*-2 is struggling with your subject E_S
31260:65	And I thought , well now , here you have a student who *T*-1 is trying *-3 to pass , who *T*-2 is struggling with your subject E_S
31262:4	What are you telling that student *T*-1 ? E_S
31266:26	Because I have a stepson *ICH*-1 now who *T*-2 's twenty-five E_S
31269:44	and I think , you know , you have *-1 to teach how * to write an answer *T*-2 and , you know , how * to construct a thought process *T*-3 . E_S
31269:80	and I think , you know , you have *-1 to teach how * to write an answer *T*-2 and , you know , how * to construct a thought process *T*-3 . E_S
31275:13	And that 's what *T*-1 's , you know , really scary to me . E_S
31279:145	And if they ca n't *?* , I mean if they have missed that training , then somebody , you know , before \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] start *-4 penalizing them with bad grades for *-2 not being able *-3 to communicate what they 're thinking *T*-1 , teach them these basic skills . E_S
31282:44	It *EXP*-1 's pretty sad * to think , uh , about those who , even today , *T*-2 are graduating from school E_S
31283:31	and they are telling that they do n't know how * to read *T*-1 , you know . E_S
31308:29	This is the kid \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 really , you know , barely made it through high school . E_S
31339:39	Maybe I should volunteer *-1 to , you know , teach what I know *T*-2 . E_S
31349:14	So , uh , what do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S
31358:22	because I ca n't really see why anyone , um , who *T*-1 has nothing 0 * to hide *T*-2 would object *T*-3 . E_S
31358:38	because I ca n't really see why anyone , um , who *T*-1 has nothing 0 * to hide *T*-2 would object *T*-3 . E_S
31387:16	I do n't know how that 's going *-1 to affect , uh , E_S
31405:6	And what *T*-1 happens \[ \[ if it , \+ you know , if it , \] \+ if they \] catch it , E_S
31419:73	For example , that one , uh , positive would not be , uh , accepted *-1 as an automatic , um , reason for whatever they might be going , *-2 to do *T*-6 if they found a positive , uh , dismissal or treatment or whatever , but \[ that , \+ that \] what it would do *T*-3 is it would trigger , perhaps , uh , one or two more stages where further tests could be \[ ta- , \+ \] uh , done *-4 *T*-5 .

E_S
31446:174	I guess 0 \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ uh , I \] would not want *-1 to have anyone in my family , uh , victimized *-4 by \[ someone who , \+ you know , \[ a , \+ a \] bus driver or a train engineer or something like that , who , \] um , you know , *T*-2 had n't been tested *-3 . E_S
31490:10	according to what \[ you , \+ you \] hear *T*-1 . E_S
31497:52	We really only know of one , uh , young man \[ who , \+ uh , who *T*-1 's \] a fam- , N_S

31505:31	But I know of a number of other people who *T*-1 have , you know , gotten all messed *-2 up . E_S
31527:47	and he 's now a young man about twenty , I guess 0 *T*-2 , who , um , *T*-1 just got really down the wrong path . E_S
31532:14	But * seeing what drugs did *T*-1 to him \[ makes me see , \+ makes me realize \] what it could do *T*-2 to people , you know , in the work force as well . E_S

31540:4	What limits *T*-1 ought *-2 to be put *-3 on it , do you think 0 *T*-4 ? E_S
31542:65	Well , the limits , uh , uh , would , I think 0 *T*-5 , have *-3 to do with what I 'd alluded to *T*-1 before , \[ that there needs *-6 to be a further , \+ um , \[ that , \+ that \] one positive \] on a drug test , would not constitute , uh , dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might , uh , have *T*-4 set up for those who *T*-2 genuinely have a problem . E_S

E_S
31568:20	and undoubtedly there are people who *T*-1 would be victimized *-2 by this , um , \[ that *T*-3 would , \+ that , \] you know , N_S

31584:27	Personally , I think 0 that 's what I was about *-1 to say *T*-2 is that everyone needs *-3 to be tested *-4 . E_S
31591:37	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know why it *EXP*-1 would be , you know , uh , bad * to test just every- *T*-2 , E_S
31612:24	but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want *T*-1 . E_S
31698:47	it 's not worth * getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong *T*-1 . E_S
31703:30	Because it always seems 0 it goes wrong when you try *-1 to do something *T*-2 . E_S
31719:15	In cold frames or whatever the , N_S
31756:66	\[ well , \+ well , \] \[ we live , \+ we live \] really close to Lake Champlain , which *T*-1 is in the Champlain Valley , E_S

31817:4	When they start *-2 getting rid of technicians *T*-1 , N_S

31858:26	\[ Yo- , \+ you \] know what eucalyptus is *T*-1 ? E_S

31878:23	I 'd walk into a room where some of that , N_S
31879:16	and I 'd wonder what is that *T*-1 , you know , E_S
31899:14	Maybe that 's why they 're so slow *T*-1 . E_S
31913:61	but \[ \[ I do n't , \+ I , \] \+ I 'm \] so , uh , timid when it comes to * starting a business *T*-1 . E_S
31929:17	But I know someone who *T*-1 does a lot of woodworking for a hobby . E_S
31930:53	Um , he does it , * believe it or not , I would n't imagine why , but * to get out of the house , away from his wife , E_S
31936:5	What they do *T*-1 is 0 they work construction , E_S
31981:25	but he 's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost , * \[ to , \+ to \] do something like that *T*-1 . E_S
32017:16	I do n't know why E_S
32025:31	I \[ do- , \+ do n't \] know where they came from *T*-1 . E_S
32030:7	So what I 'm planting *T*-1 or actually transplanting *T*-1 is \[ a tree that *T*-3 's , \+ or trees that *T*-2 are \] already leafed out . E_S
32036:29	Mostly , I think 0 in a place where it 's really cold *T*-1 they do it in the fall , E_S let them winter you know , through the fall , E_S
32041:57	\[ It , \+ it \] just kind of depends on \[ what you 're , \+ what you 're \] planting *T*-1 , E_S

32084:5	where we are *T*-1 right now there are very few trees . E_S

32129:9	Well , where is it *T*-1 , E_S
32141:5	What type of lawn and garden work do you do *T*-1 ? E_S

33000:7	but when I do *T*-2 I try *-1 to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare *T*-3 ahead of time , E_S
33011:49	and you can make it ahead of time and then , um , make the sauce when you 're ready * \[ to , \+ um , to \] serve it *T*-2 . E_S
33040:30	Well , \[ how do , make , \+ how do \[ you , \+ you \] cook \] crawfish *T*-1 ? E_S
33061:17	you can always tell whenever they 're cooked *-1 *T*-2 if they 've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out . E_S
33088:47	Huh . \[ When you were , \+ um , \[ whe- , \+ when \] you serve \] it *T*-1 do you shell them and then serve em too ? E_S
33118:47	\[ it jus- \+ \[ i- \+ it \] just \] depends on what type it was *T*-1 I guess 0 *T*-2 E_S
33140:18	It also depends on who *T*-1 's cooking it and how much seasoning they use *T*-2 stuff like that E_S
33140:37	It also depends on who *T*-1 's cooking it and how much seasoning they use *T*-2 stuff like that E_S
33148:36	We have \[ a \+ a \] friend another couple where the husband is the one who *T*-1 cooks all the time *T*-2 E_S
33148:55	We have \[ a \+ a \] friend another couple where the husband is the one who *T*-1 cooks all the time *T*-2 E_S
33153:11	That 's what I need *T*-1 E_S
33156:11	that 's what I wish 0 I had *T*-1 E_S
33157:31	but in our family I am the one who who *T*-1 cooks E_S
33165:48	And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest *ICH*-1 going where you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I 'd try *-2 to outdo him *T*-4 and then he 'd try *-3 to outdo me *T*-4 E_S
33184:46	\[ that \+ that \] got pretty competitive you know as far as who *T*-1 could come up with the best recipe E_S
33258:24	\[ I \+ that 's about how much I \] can cook *T*-1 You know E_S
33266:16	so she 's tired when she comes home in the afternoon *T*-1 E_S
33287:5	whenever we have \[ at \+ \] the big get-together over at her house *T*-1 she makes this meat ball sauce E_S
33295:16	I do n't know what she calls them *T*-1 in E_S
33318:31	so salt and pepper Um and chopped up water chestnuts which *T*-1 is something different um E_S
33341:5	when you use corn starch \[ in \+ in \] gravy *T*-1 like you know when you have um Chinese food *T*-2 That kind of a gravy or a sauce that *T*-3 comes with a lot of that
33341:54	when you use corn starch \[ in \+ in \] gravy *T*-1 like you know when you have um Chinese food *T*-2 That kind of a gravy or a sauce that *T*-3 comes with a lot of that
33348:10	Well um how long do you cook the meatballs *T*-1 E_S
33355:11	Uh then what I usually do *T*-1 is I freeze them E_S
33356:10	And then when you 're ready *-1 to serve them *T*-2 then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce And heat it E_S
33444:36	It 's good cause I was curious about that today when I saw those for sale *T*-1 E_S
33469:11	That 's what the nurses kept *-2 saying *T*-1 as they laughed all the way , you know , down the hallway . E_S
33489:12	Do you , when you go to the MUMBLEx *T*-1 , N_S
33494:5	when you go over there *T*-1 does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged *-2 , either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek *T*-3 , in terms of , 0 \[ there 's so much , \+ it 's so much \] of a weight orientation , weight lifting , et cetera . E_S
33494:46	when you go over there *T*-1 does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged *-2 , either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek *T*-3 , in terms of , 0 \[ there 's so much , \+ it 's so much \] of a weight orientation , weight lifting , et cetera . E_S
33517:12	Or is that what you 're into *T*-1 E_S
33537:12	And the pool when it gets warmer *T*-1 . E_S
33547:10	Well , what I did *T*-1 was 0 I went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas *T*-2 , E_S
33547:68	Well , what I did *T*-1 was 0 I went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas *T*-2 , E_S
33551:51	and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where I usually stand *T*-2 in any class like that 0 I go to *T*-1 . E_S
33567:32	The orthopedist called it a , uh , basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you , and it snapped *T*-1 . E_S
33603:60	like this orthopedist said , he said 0 you 'd be surprised \[ how many basket- , \+ how many people \] *T*-1 come in here with things like that because they are active . E_S
33641:4	how 'd you do that *T*-1 ? E_S
33652:7	And when I came down *T*-1 I hit with my full weight on my foot , but on concrete . E_S
33654:4	What 'd they do *T*-1 for that ? E_S
33695:18	And there was my ego when I went ahead *T*-1 E_S
33703:7	but when you go easy *T*-1 a hundred seventy at my height , um , I 'm five eleven you need just take it easy . E_S
33710:12	Um , but when I see some wo- , N_S
33736:24	I said a few things to him when I got home *T*-1 , E_S
33737:13	I said , who *T*-1 has engineered that ? . E_S
33750:19	Do you like that , what that voice said *T*-1 , E_S
33757:11	That 's how I am *T*-1 . E_S
33766:14	it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy *T*-1 that you 'd be tired , E_S
33803:18	I said , uh , why do I feel like I need *-1 to start *-2 pushing myself more *T*-3 . E_S
33825:22	but , you know , sometime when I ask *T*-1 , I just feel like , boy , am I stupid or what . E_S
33877:14	That 's actually where this happened to me , out in , I say *RNR*-1 Plano *T*-2 , E_S
33908:74	they tried *-1 to put me in some kind of immobilized walker , because he does n't like *-2 to put casts on when it 's warm *T*-3 . E_S
33913:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
33952:12	Uh , well what would you say 0 your opinion *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 on gun control ? E_S
33955:60	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] had mixed emotions *ICH*-4 , I guess 0 *T*-3 , when I listen to , uh , the radio \[ and , \+ and \] watch T V *T*-2 about the different , uh , things that *T*-1 are happening . E_S
33964:9	Uh , how do you feel about it *T*-1 ? E_S
33988:42	Well , \[ up , \+ uh , up \] in New England where I 'm from *T*-1 , uh , you had *-2 to get a permit before you could buy any \[ \[ amu- , \+ am- , \] \+ ammunition . \] E_S
34027:4	How long was the waiting period out there *T*-1 ? E_S
34037:134	Because \[ if , \+ if \] you 're going *-1 to go *-2 buy something , uh , uh , of that nature , I think 0 \[ you , \+ you 're \] going *-3 to have some idea as to what you 're going *-4 to do *T*-5 with it . E_S
34064:85	you have a little , uh , thing *ICH*-2 \[ on the \[ bo- , \+ bottom \] of th- , \+ on top of the barrel \] where \[ you , \+ you \] turn it *T*-1 , E_S
34123:16	Well , that 's what my husband , N_S
34142:42	even after you wait your nine days , if you do n't know how * to handle it *T*-1 , it 's just like * putting someone *ICH*-4 in an automobile that *T*-2 does n't know how * to drive *T*-3 . E_S
34142:114	even after you wait your nine days , if you do n't know how * to handle it *T*-1 , it 's just like * putting someone *ICH*-4 in an automobile that *T*-2 does n't know how * to drive *T*-3 . E_S
34168:16	I ca n't remember what \[ the na- , \+ the term *ICH*-1 \] was *T*-2 going around . E_S
34177:4	How do you feel about that *T*-1 ? E_S
34186:11	the person who *T*-1 sells the gun ought *-4 to protect themselves because if that gun 's registered *-2 to them and somebody else uses that gun in something , the cops are going *-3 to come to you . E_S
34212:25	and , uh , I do n't know why I never registered it *T*-1 E_S
34243:76	And if you try *-1 to do anything , uh , like , uh , *-3 not identify yourself to the government , they know who you are *T*-2 . E_S
34251:47	\[ bu- , \+ bu- , \] you know , they know so , how much money *ICH*-2 you make *T*-1 a week to , uh , probably your , uh , N_S
34253:14	I was seeing what they was banging on *T*-1 . E_S
34258:57	\[ You , \+ you \] were talking about , uh , uh , \[ Fed- , \+ what *ICH*-2 the Federal \] government knows *T*-1 about people . E_S
34264:75	\[ They , \+ they \] probably know everything from *ICH*-2 , half the time \[ \[ wh- , \+ ho- , \] \+ what \] time you go to the bathroom *T*-1 . E_S
34334:57	Uh , but I would like *-1 to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who *T*-2 has what weapons . E_S
34342:34	Uh , we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have *T*-1 . E_S
34344:60	Unfortunately , \[ we , \+ uh , we \] vote for \[ the , \+ the \] people who *T*-1 spend the money , E_S
34353:8	so what kind of movies have you seen *T*-1 , lately , I guess ? E_S
34417:16	but I like that where they run *-1 tense *T*-2 . E_S
34426:9	Well , what other movies have you seen *T*-1 then lately ? E_S
34437:73	I mean , I 'm sure 0 I 'm going *-1 to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives *T*-2 ,
34461:11	You know what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
34467:36	but it was on a higher level , you know , where there were some things that kids did n't understand *T*-1 that adults did *T*-2 *T*-3 , E_S
34493:13	So , if and when we ever get a baby-sitter *T*-1 , like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS , we go *-2 see it . E_S
34505:4	What was the last comedy 0 you saw *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
34507:10	Oh gosh what was the last comedy 0 we saw *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
34512:21	and I ca n't think of which one it was *T*-1 . E_S
34541:40	I mean , \[ there , \+ there \] were times when \[ he was , \+ like , he 'd \] be running with a gun or whatever *T*-1 . E_S
34542:24	He did n't look like a cop when he did it *T*-1 . E_S
34684:14	That 's exactly what , I was going *-1 to say *T*-2 . E_S
34705:16	I do n't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both *T*-1 . E_S
34743:70	It really and truly does , because * to get the feeling of like \[ when the buffalos are , \+ when they 're chasing the buffalos \] and everything *T*-1 you 've got *-2 to be where you feel it *T*-3 . E_S
34743:120	It really and truly does , because * to get the feeling of like \[ when the buffalos are , \+ when they 're chasing the buffalos \] and everything *T*-1 you 've got *-2 to be where you feel it *T*-3 . E_S
34791:11	You know what I mean *T*-1 , you know . E_S
34805:10	but from what I heard *T*-1 , the guy who *T*-2 got it was better , E_S
34805:32	but from what I heard *T*-1 , the guy who *T*-2 got it was better , E_S
34820:16	She does n't mind when we cover up her eyes *T*-1 . E_S
34826:52	\[ It , \+ it 's \] just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped \[ its hide , \+ the hides *T*-1 . \] E_S
34881:19	I kind of like it when they do that *T*-1 , because the video , like I said , N_S
34900:15	We have cable which *T*-1 helps a lot . E_S
34912:23	I 'm getting to the point where , you know , \[ I watch , \+ well I watch \] NICK AT NIGHT *T*-1 . E_S
34937:27	since I got out of college , which *T*-1 was about five years ago , my T V viewing started *-2 to tend more towards , uh , documentary , news programs , things like that . E_S
34945:15	I think 0 when you 're in college *T*-1 \[ you kind of , \+ \] you have more of a regular schedule in terms of , you can watch every week . E_S
34955:5	when my kids were real little and I was home *T*-1 , I watched , N_S
34956:4	where I was home *T*-1
34957:4	where I watched things on a more regular basis *T*-2 . N_S
34958:48	But right now , the last things 0 I watched *T*-1 regularly was THIRTY SOMETHING when it first came out *T*-2 . E_S
34988:31	and we 'll , you know , look at what you want *-1 to see *T*-2 . E_S
34989:33	* Let 's just turn it on and see what *T*-1 's on . E_S
35018:14	I know exactly how you feel *T*-1 . E_S
35020:11	You know what I 'm saying *T*-1 . E_S
35039:20	And it *EXP*-2 's surprising how much it 's changed *T*-1 E_S
35064:32	I mean , \[ when we , \+ when our \] children were younger *T*-2 , when they were like four years old , three years old , five years old *T*-1 , we just had Sesame Street E_S
35064:56	I mean , \[ when we , \+ when our \] children were younger *T*-2 , when they were like four years old , three years old , five years old *T*-1 , we just had Sesame Street E_S
35081:17	I do n't understand why , first of all , the public puts up with it *T*-1 . Second of all , why the networks think that , you know , we enjoy that kind of stuff *T*-2 . E_S
35081:70	I do n't understand why , first of all , the public puts up with it *T*-1 . Second of all , why the networks think that , you know , we enjoy that kind of stuff *T*-2 . E_S
35104:14	You know , why do you do this to yourself *T*-1 ? E_S
35106:4	Why do you do this *T*-1 ? E_S
35121:30	As a matter of fact , you know when I was a kid *T*-1 , * excuse me , my parents used *-2 to have , N_S
35127:64	And if they saw us watching \[ the , \+ \] something , E_S they 'd say , all right , what did you see *T*-2 on WHAT *T*-1 'S NEW , E_S
35127:83	And if they saw us watching \[ the , \+ \] something , E_S they 'd say , all right , what did you see *T*-2 on WHAT *T*-1 'S NEW , E_S
35129:48	the children 's program I think 0 *T*-3 at the time was called *-2 WHAT *T*-1 'S NEW . E_S
35178:13	and I know how everybody 's doing *T*-1 , E_S
35193:25	But again you 're in a situation where you 're watching mostly , uh , commercials *T*-1 , E_S
35197:11	You know what I did *T*-1 . E_S
35198:20	There was a time there where I could tape things *T*-1 E_S
35271:10	no matter where you were *T*-1 you stopped and sat down and watched it . E_S
35282:35	But it 's real different show than it was *?* when it started *T*-1 . E_S
35288:22	but it 's real different than what it used *-1 to be *T*-2 . E_S
35335:8	so what kind of cars are you looking at *T*-1 ? E_S
35439:7	But when they 're three years old *T*-1 they 're , N_S
35447:12	That 's what I 'm thinking about *T*-1 on my next car is do I want *-2 to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new E_S
35455:94	But \[ I just , \+ I \] kind of worry about *-2 getting a car that *T*-1 's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that *T*-3 owned it want *-4 to get rid *-5 of it *T*-6 . E_S
35481:30	And then you 'll have a realistic assessment of what you 're getting *T*-1 . E_S
35484:7	About how much do they charge *T*-1 *-2 to do something like that , E_S
35518:10	Well , what you can do *T*-1 is * take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years E_S
35522:7	and when you 're ready *-1 to get another car *T*-2 * just pay cash for it . E_S
35546:29	I did n't want *-3 to interfere with whatever they 're trying *-1 to record *T*-2 . E_S
35625:5	What kind of car is it *T*-1 ? E_S
35660:5	When I bought my R X seven *T*-2 , \[ I , \+ \] uh , best offer 0 I got *T*-1 for my other car was twenty-five hundred . E_S
35674:4	What I think *T*-1 . E_S
35686:29	I bet you 0 it 's kind of what I decided *T*-1 . E_S
35698:21	and they had a little file where they said which dealers *T*-1 participated \[ in the , \+ in the \] fleet program *T*-2 , E_S
35698:32	and they had a little file where they said which dealers *T*-1 participated \[ in the , \+ in the \] fleet program *T*-2 , E_S
35703:8	and what you could expect *T*-1 *ICH*-2 , they said *T*-3 , you know , a five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything . E_S
35715:105	But \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I got a pretty good deal , because I went back to the Town North Mazda right off Central and offered them the same price as what I knew 0 I was going *-1 to be able *-2 to get it for *T*-3 in Arlington E_S
35733:7	And what *T*-1 's so funny , E_S they took the car , \[ they , \+ I knew 0 they \] were going *-2 to pull it from Town North because that 's where the white one was *T*-1 . E_S
35733:108	And what *T*-1 's so funny , E_S they took the car , \[ they , \+ I knew 0 they \] were going *-2 to pull it from Town North because that 's where the white one was *T*-1 . E_S
35748:18	And I laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand mile checkup *T*-1 E_S
35761:29	and I 'm sure 0 he probably knew what *T*-1 was going on the very next day E_S
35842:30	I mean , I went in the service when I was eighteen *T*-1 , And , uh , stayed in for ten years . E_S
35863:20	and that 's , uh , how he put himself through school *T*-1 basically . E_S
35895:31	and still I ended up *-1 going two semesters when I got out *T*-2 just *-3 to get my degree . E_S
35930:81	\[ All these , \+ all this \] money that we 're throwing *T*-1 away *-3 to pay people to go out and do things when we 're paying all these welfare recipients *T*-2 , E_S
35956:15	my next door neighbor when I was growing up *T*-1 , worked for the unemployment division , E_S
35957:30	and his sole job was just tracking down people who *T*-1 were getting benefits and able-bodied E_S
35975:5	What I hear *T*-1 one time , I think 0 it was on Paul Harvey 's , uh , radio segment , that he said that if the money that *T*-2 goes into welfare each year was *-3 to be given *-4 directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy , each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars *T*-5 . E_S
35995:60	and now , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] uh , started out when I first got in graduate school *T*-1 E_S I was going into public administration , E_S
36006:7	and when you 're writing up budgets *T*-1 , you wonder , okay , how much money do we need *T*-2 . E_S
36006:46	and when you 're writing up budgets *T*-1 , you wonder , okay , how much money do we need *T*-2 . E_S
36028:4	What *T*-1 would happen if the MUMBLEx required young people to do service to the country , E_S
36029:5	what should they get *T*-2 in return , I wonder *T*-1 . E_S
36065:33	I mean , \[ what are we , \+ what are we \] becoming *T*-1 ? E_S
36068:13	As opposed to what we were *T*-1 twenty years ago . E_S
36073:14	We taught them how * to do it *T*-1 , E_S
36086:4	which *T*-1 is good for them , E_S
36117:30	Well , you know , you know 0 why they do it *T*-1 is so they can get them out of the house . E_S
36137:19	and , you know , when I 's in graduate school *-1 working on my master 's degree in math *T*-2 , I was , uh , teaching as \[ part of my , \+ part of the \] program . E_S
36140:45	And , uh , it helped me out because I learned things and learned how *-1 to do things differently *T*-2 . E_S
36147:24	And \[ when , \+ uh , when \] come time 0 * to get out of school *T*-3 *T*-2 , I thought , Boy , I 'd like *-4 to teach . E_S
36181:60	I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] have a great deal of admiration for these people who *T*-1 can go out there and do that . E_S
36190:4	what *T*-1 's more important ,
36207:49	Well I bet you 0 there 's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who *T*-1 would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year . E_S
36217:17	There was a time when unions were needed *-2 *T*-1 . E_S
36228:20	this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap *T*-1 , E_S
36240:42	\[ \[ and , \+ and \] \+ and \] that 's really what *T*-1 happened to the steel industry in this country . E_S
36281:16	I do n't care what kind it is *T*-1 . E_S
36324:5	what else do I do *T*-1 .
36373:26	but , \[ when you , \+ when you \] work out *T*-1 , do you pretty much do it on your own schedule , E_S
36390:23	And then you can do it whenever you want *T*-1 I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
36402:38	I guess 0 it depends on the person , depends on how motivated you are *T*-1 . E_S
36434:5	when it was cold *T*-1 we would go to the mall because you ca n't take the babies out very easily . E_S
36438:19	So \[ we , \+ when we \] go *T*-1 , we \[ have about , \+ do about \] fifteen miles a week , E_S
36440:21	So it 's a little harder when you 're depending on other people 0 *T*-3 to do it with you *T*-2 because you have *-1 to meet their schedules as well , E_S
36444:38	\[ but \+ but \] I enjoy *-2 doing it more when I 've got other people with me *T*-1 . E_S
36488:24	well , then I do n't know how much you 've been through *T*-1 it , E_S
36535:16	I 'm not sure how long we 've been talking *T*-1 E_S
36664:16	I do n't know how you can really keep , uh , the inside of a tent clean *T*-1 . E_S
36672:10	well , what \[ \[ we were doing *T*-2 , \+ we were just going *-1 to say , \] \+ we 're just going *-3 to sleep \] in the tent and hang out at night , so , you know ,
36674:5	what he wants *-4 to do *T*-5 , E_S we had brought his friend along , was * play in the tent . E_S
36694:36	and \[ even , \+ even \] when in Oklahoma when we camped *T*-1 I really did n't notice a problem with bugs . E_S

36924:4	how do you feel *T*-1 about it ? E_S
36930:7	so when you have the basic needs , uh , being unmet * *T*-1 , I do n't think 0 you think globally as far as , you know , * being a threat to other people in the world . E_S

36954:89	Well , \[ I do , \+ I do \] realize that , uh , uh , the Bush Administration is n't too happy \[ with , \+ with \] how they 're handling their internal , uh , strife *T*-2 , you know , as far as diplomacy is concerned *-1 . E_S

36999:43	Uh , I think 0 it 's kind of escalated to a point where it 's out of control *T*-1 . E_S

37005:11	You know what I 'm saying *T*-1 ? E_S

37432:70	but they find that , \[ \[ tha- , \+ tha- , \] \+ there 's \] a connection between that and how they do *T*-1 in Spring training the following year . E_S

37451:23	\[ what do you , \+ what do you \] think *T*-1 of Incaviglia 's loss . E_S

37521:50	\[ \[ I , \+ that 's , \] \+ I do n't \] know how Oakland 's going *-1 to react to *-2 being , uh , swept *-3 in the World Series last year *T*-4 . E_S
37522:41	They could very easily , uh , take that as a challenge . Which *T*-1 is the way 0 most teams \[ nat- , \+ you know , naturally \] do *T*-2 . Uh , \[ and , \+ and , \] just go out and not give anybody a chance * to beat them , E_S
37564:7	Well how are the Cardinals *T*-1 ? E_S
37571:19	Um , \[ from \+ what I hear *T*-1 from \] everybody up there , they 're not going *-2 to have a good year because they let too many people go . E_S
37578:89	\[ It , \+ it \] really kind of depends \[ on , \+ on , \] um , \[ what they were , \+ you know , what they were \] looking for *T*-1 . E_S
37584:13	You know what I think 0 *T*-1 is remarkable is , uh , N_S
37585:15	it seems that what you really need *-1 to do *T*-2 *-3 to win though , is * to have a team that *T*-4 has reasonable talent and has some people that *T*-5 \[ \[ have , \+ have , \] \+ have \] real breakthrough years . E_S
37590:29	\[ And , \+ and \] the question is how do you forecast that *T*-1 , E_S
37594:57	\[ if you had *-1 to , \+ if you had *-2 to \] bet on who *T*-3 would be in the World Series , I mean it would be really tough . E_S
37608:22	\[ Well , \+ well \] when are the Rangers going *-1 to come through th- *T*-2 , N_S
37639:11	Well considering what I 've seen *T*-1 in the last , uh , you know , two seasons , I 'm beginning *-2 to agree with that , E_S
37646:40	In other words if you 've got a player on your team who *T*-1 's helping your team , then * keep him there . E_S
37651:26	And I think 0 that 's really what *T*-1 's been hurting , uh , the , uh , Rangers . E_S
37675:66	\[ I , \+ you know , I \] think that there 's coming to a point *ICH*-1 real soon when ticket prices are going *-2 to be to the point where the average fan ca n't go *T*-3 *T*-4 E_S

37680:4	When it *EXP*-2 starts *-3 costing you fifty or a hundred dollars * to go to a game *T*-1 N_S
37691:18	but \[ how , \+ how \] often do you do that *T*-1 . E_S
37717:41	we 're going *-1 to talk about the public school system , What *T*-2 's wrong with it , \[ an , \+ or \] if anything is wrong with it and what we can do *T*-3 about it , what *T*-4 should be done *-6 about it . E_S

37731:63	I always thought that teachers never got paid *-1 nearly enough , I mean , * to be doing what they 're doing *T*-2 , uh . E_S
37735:5	When I was in college *T*-1 \[ I , \+ I \] enjoyed teaching , E_S
37753:54	\[ And , \+ you know , and \] they 're being paid *-1 , probably half what most people being paid *-2 *T*-3 . E_S
37766:5	what *T*-1 gets me is 0 I ca n't believe that \[ Congress , \+ uh , or , our state legislature \] ca n't come up with , uh , some kind of workable means 0 * to have funds for the school *T*-2 . E_S
37797:4	What 's that going *-2 to be like *T*-1 . E_S
37801:30	We 're going *-1 to be teaching him what we can *?* *T*-2 at home , of course , because , uh , I guess 0 we do n't trust the school system , which *T*-3 is very sad , uh , E_S

37845:51	I think 0 there 's only going *-1 to be one solution to school funding which I do n't think 0 *T*-2 will be necessarily the best way E_S
37846:17	but I think 0 what *T*-1 's going *-2 to have *-3 to happen is 0 there 's going *-4 to have *-5 to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids . E_S
37865:107	And , you know , \[ that 's going * to , \+ that 's going *-4 to \] affect the people that *T*-1 are having kids in school , of course , which *T*-2 is probably the only fair thing 0 * to do *T*-3 . E_S

37885:13	I mean when I was in junior high and high school *T*-1 that never happened . E_S
37892:21	And now , you know , what do we have *T*-1 now . E_S

38990:7	and whenever I go *-1 visit my parents *T*-2 , they 're always saying , Well , * bring some of your tapes . E_S
39037:19	It 's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers *T*-1 , E_S
39061:33	And then the ones in my apartment , half of which *T*-1 do n't look real healthy , E_S
39084:36	And \[ I 'd , \+ I \] think 0 when I was real little *T*-1 I probably had a finger in on that every time 0 he did it *T*-2 and had *-3 to be out there and watch and that type of stuff . E_S
39150:22	and we thought , well maybe when they 're a little bit bigger *T*-1 then we 'll , N_S
39162:21	If we get a place where we can have both *T*-1 , it 'll be great , E_S
39190:57	because , you kind of , N_S \[ even , \+ even \] a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something *T*-1 . E_S
39197:7	Especially when they 're not quite to the age of * understanding that they 're hurting , you know , E_S that N_S
39264:8	so . Where did you get your recipe for it *T*-1 ? E_S
39293:4	What \[ is , \+ uh , is \] a marsala wine *T*-1
39333:4	What do you use *T*-1 MUMBLEx ? E_S
39335:4	What do you serve *T*-1 with it ? E_S
39339:4	What do you serve *T*-1 with it ? E_S
39344:11	That 's what I do *T*-1 too . E_S
39353:11	that 's what I 've got *T*-1 . E_S
39379:4	What time should we be there *T*-1 ? . E_S
39397:30	\[ I know , \+ I know \] what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
39410:48	and then you , um , take things like kiwi , and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want *T*-1 E_S
39415:19	and I ca n't remember what else *T*-1 is in it E_S
39515:4	How long , does it keep *T*-1 , E_S
39551:19	and I have been debating what *-2 to cook *T*-1 because one of my guests is a vegetarian . E_S
39567:5	when they come down *T*-1 I 'll grill those and brush on a little lemon butter sauce E_S
39612:11	That 's what I was just thinking *T*-1 , E_S
39618:4	where did you get , E_S
39622:4	where did you get this cook book *T*-1 ? E_S
39638:24	I 'm trying *-1 to see who it 's published *-2 by *T*-3 ,
39727:33	And we have a share alike column in the paper , where people , you know , write in and share recipes or write in and say I 'm looking for this recipe *T*-1 , E_S
39735:13	and that 's where I get a lot of my recipes *T*-1 . E_S
39744:4	what was that *T*-1 ? . E_S
39776:112	So , \[ I , \+ I \] try *-1 to always keep my eyes open \[ and \+ \] because a lot of time you can \[ find , \+ find \] really good recipes where you would n't even think about it *T*-2 . E_S
39788:24	so \[ which , \+ uh , what \] basketball teams are you interested in *T*-1 ? E_S
39790:55	Well , I guess 0 I 'm a big \[ Laker , \+ L A Laker \] fan , when it comes to pros *T*-1 . E_S
39923:41	\[ they , \+ they \] play the pro style , is , what I 've always called it *T*-1 . E_S
39953:126	\[ \[ and that , \+ and that , \] \+ so that 's \] a terrible time 0 * to have *-1 to deal with that *T*-2 , \[ right in , \+ \] \[ when it , \+ when it \] counts so much *T*-3 . E_S
40025:6	whoever *T*-1 has home court advantage is going *-2 to win that one I think 0 *T*-3 . E_S
40029:4	where does Detroit fit in *T*-1 ? E_S
40055:25	you can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird 's , starting *-1 to click on all cylinders *T*-2 . E_S
40068:33	uh , one game and he 'll be playing to where everything 0 he throws *T*-1 up goes in *T*-2 E_S
40082:14	Well that 's when , you do it *T*-1 . E_S
40101:14	Well , anybody who *T*-1 has David Robinson , has got *-2 to have a chance anyway . E_S
40107:53	I use *-1 to say 0 Akimo Lija was the dominant player , you know , when he , N_S
40112:23	but Robinson 's getting up there where , every game , he 's just , N_S
40121:75	nobody 's got enough beef , I guess 0 *T*-4 , 0 *-1 to challenge him \[ when he 's , \+ when he 's \] driving hard to the hoop *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
40145:22	Well , that might have been what it was *T*-1 , E_S
40149:29	\[ I , \+ maybe I \] misunderstood what they meant *T*-1 . E_S
40166:11	That 's what he was being paid *-2 *T*-1 , you know , E_S
40171:15	Oh , boy , what a good job he had *T*-1 . E_S
40173:11	That 's what I think *T*-1 . E_S
40188:4	who 's *T*-1 the other one that *T*-2 's doing so well this year , E_S
40202:4	What do they have *T*-1 E_S
40208:11	I forget how that works *T*-1 . E_S
40233:43	They are two guys that *T*-1 seem *-2 to find a way when they , N_S
40235:4	When it 's on the line *T*-1 . E_S
40237:5	When it 's on the line *T*-1 , they seem *-2 to find a way . You know , E_S
40241:21	uh , so , those are what *T*-1 makes a champion I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
40308:43	I 'm kind of had \[ different , \+ different \] ideas from what probably the majority of people have *T*-1 , E_S
40313:19	He started in day care when he was eight weeks old *T*-1 . E_S
40324:99	I mean \[ I , \+ I \] kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home \[ with a , \+ with \] private individual , when the door shuts *T*-1 , that one person has total control , E_S
40349:14	You know , how can you help *-1 depending on the day care center *T*-2 , you know , E_S
40353:21	you got *-1 to *?* when you hear about all the horrible things that *T*-2 happen in day care centers *T*-3 , E_S
40354:43	have you ever noticed 0 they 're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it *T*-1 , you know , kind of thing . E_S
40364:15	So , that 's what I did *T*-1 E_S
40387:13	and the woman who *T*-1 owned it sold it . E_S
40395:13	and the people who *T*-1 came in , \[ it just was n't , \+ it , just was n't \] the same E_S
40407:21	and I , moved him , which *T*-1 was an extremely traumatic experience E_S
40444:11	that 's what I wanted *-1 to *?* *T*-2 , because \[ I , \+ uh , you know I \] just could n't wait *-3 to have kids E_S
40476:77	but , uh , boy , I tell you 0 with summer coming up I 'm just pulling my hair out , in terms of what I 'm going *-1 to do *T*-2 , E_S
40485:11	I know how that goes *T*-1 . E_S
40493:14	and , uh , when school lets out *T*-1 , \[ \[ I just do n't , \+ I have n't , \] \+ I have \] no idea what I 'm going *-2 to do *T*-3 , because I certainly ca n't afford what we did *T*-4 last year which *T*-5 was , N_S
40493:90	and , uh , when school lets out *T*-1 , \[ \[ I just do n't , \+ I have n't , \] \+ I have \] no idea what I 'm going *-2 to do *T*-3 , because I certainly ca n't afford what we did *T*-4 last year which *T*-5 was , N_S
40493:137	and , uh , when school lets out *T*-1 , \[ \[ I just do n't , \+ I have n't , \] \+ I have \] no idea what I 'm going *-2 to do *T*-3 , because I certainly ca n't afford what we did *T*-4 last year which *T*-5 was , N_S
40493:157	and , uh , when school lets out *T*-1 , \[ \[ I just do n't , \+ I have n't , \] \+ I have \] no idea what I 'm going *-2 to do *T*-3 , because I certainly ca n't afford what we did *T*-4 last year which *T*-5 was , N_S
40514:12	* forget what else we did *T*-1 E_S
40540:46	I was going *-1 to say 0 they 're getting to the age where , you should be able *-2 to trust that a little bit *T*-3 , E_S
40548:38	in fact I 'm doing that right now with their afternoons , when they get home before I do *T*-1 . You know , E_S
40567:11	that 's what we have *-1 to do *T*-2 though . E_S
40579:20	\[ Where do , \+ where do \] you live *T*-1 ? E_S
40620:28	and one year , I guess last year when I went back to work *T*-1 I had N_S
40629:16	Well , that 's why we picked it *T*-1 , because they \[ were , \+ were \] supposed *-2 to be real great , E_S
40635:42	\[ in , \+ in \] Plano , it 's open classroom situation where they do n't have walls *T*-1 , E_S
40648:11	you know what fun they had *T*-1 with these computer games E_S
40691:14	I mean , how young can they start T-Ball and soccer *-2 *T*-1 ? . E_S
40716:4	which *T*-1 was really the first year 0 he was really able *-2 to *T*-3 N_S
40723:37	and to \[ know what we wan- , \+ know what he was \] doing *T*-1 you know , and enjoy it , N_S
40750:40	so stuff like that *ICH*-3 is starting *-1 to come along where it 's really , getting fun *T*-2 , you know . N_S
40776:22	and he 's always having fun when I pick him up *T*-1 E_S
40787:5	whenever you say Bright Steps *T*-1 , everybody goes , oh , I 've heard 0 that 's the best day care in town , you know , E_S
40818:11	She knows what she 's doing *T*-1 , E_S
40890:60	\[ but , \+ but \] \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] like where he was *T*-1 before I was only paying sixty three , E_S
40913:25	and I have peace of mind , where he is *T*-1 E_S
40934:5	when school holidays come around *T*-1 , I used *-2 to have such a problem with that . E_S
40956:9	And , what they did *T*-1 , they had , uh , a book made *-2 up E_S
40957:18	and it was like , when our ancestors first came over *T*-1 . E_S
40964:12	And , then what they did *T*-1 was they asked every family *-4 to write something about their family . \[ And , \+ \] like , how many kids you had *T*-2 , and who you had married *T*-3 , E_S
40964:86	And , then what they did *T*-1 was they asked every family *-4 to write something about their family . \[ And , \+ \] like , how many kids you had *T*-2 , and who you had married *T*-3 , E_S
40964:108	And , then what they did *T*-1 was they asked every family *-4 to write something about their family . \[ And , \+ \] like , how many kids you had *T*-2 , and who you had married *T*-3 , E_S
40969:41	and it showed \[ who my , \+ uh , well , who my \] husband 's parents were *T*-1 , you know . And , who he married *T*-2 and then how many children we had *T*-3 and then like his brothers and sisters E_S
40969:81	and it showed \[ who my , \+ uh , well , who my \] husband 's parents were *T*-1 , you know . And , who he married *T*-2 and then how many children we had *T*-3 and then like his brothers and sisters E_S
40969:101	and it showed \[ who my , \+ uh , well , who my \] husband 's parents were *T*-1 , you know . And , who he married *T*-2 and then how many children we had *T*-3 and then like his brothers and sisters E_S
41004:35	And , it told like , uh , you know , where the first Connallys came over *T*-1 , E_S
41009:21	and , um , it told what *T*-1 happened when they got there *T*-2 and how many kids they had *T*-3 E_S
41009:32	and , um , it told what *T*-1 happened when they got there *T*-2 and how many kids they had *T*-3 E_S
41009:52	and , um , it told what *T*-1 happened when they got there *T*-2 and how many kids they had *T*-3 E_S
41031:16	That 's kind of how my husband and I are *T*-1 . E_S
41038:39	So , he had *-1 to kind of get used to us when we first started *-2 going together *T*-3 . E_S
41041:31	\[ That 's what , \+ that 's what \] *T*-1 happened \[ when I , \+ when I \] first , uh , met my husband *T*-2 . E_S
41041:62	\[ That 's what , \+ that 's what \] *T*-1 happened \[ when I , \+ when I \] first , uh , met my husband *T*-2 . E_S
41059:29	and he kept *-1 saying , this is where my uncle lives *T*-2 E_S
41060:13	and this is where my aunt *ICH*-2 lives *T*-1 and my uncle , E_S
41075:69	And , another thing that *T*-1 's really good about , uh , family reunions , is * having everybody just cook whatever *T*-3 is their specialty , and bring it . \[ At , \+ \] because nobody it seemed \[ like *T*-4 , \+ liked \] the same thing . E_S
41118:8	or , how did you do it *T*-1 ? E_S
41145:10	Is that how they did it *T*-1 ? E_S
41160:21	There is n't any one place where most of us live *T*-1 , E_S
41162:40	I mean , you know , there would be one person who *T*-1 lived there that *T*-2 would have a house , E_S
41166:15	But , you know what you can do *T*-1 ? E_S
41175:17	They have these places where you can rent them *T*-1 E_S
41206:33	And , then it has little rooms off of it where , you know , you 'd go and sleep at night time *T*-1 . E_S
41231:5	what you can do *T*-1 is , you can write different places , the Chamber of Commerce , tell them what you 're interested in *T*-2 . E_S
41231:66	what you can do *T*-1 is , you can write different places , the Chamber of Commerce , tell them what you 're interested in *T*-2 . E_S
41238:15	* Ask them what they have *T*-1 , you know , at area lakes and all . If they have something like that E_S
41245:68	because now every time 0 we plan anything *T*-1 , just about , we write to the Chamber of Commerce of where we 're going *T*-2 because , you can find out so much easier *ICH*-3 , that way , than * try *-4 to locate it , you know , E_S
41301:36	But , um , they had , uh , uh , thing where \[ you could , \+ everybody could \] come and meet and go out *-1 to eat *T*-2 . E_S
41308:100	But , I did n't think 0 that was as good . Because , it was like , you know , you could n't really talk and stuff , like you could *?* when , you were at the lake , or somewhere , you know , where you were out . E_S
41308:142	But , I did n't think 0 that was as good . Because , it was like , you know , you could n't really talk and stuff , like you could *?* when , you were at the lake , or somewhere , you know , where you were out . E_S
41332:28	was it *EXP*-1 hard * to decide who *-2 to invite *T*-3 and who *T*-4 not to invite *T*-4 . E_S
41332:47	was it *EXP*-1 hard * to decide who *-2 to invite *T*-3 and who *T*-4 not to invite *T*-4 . E_S
41339:4	whoever , *T*-1 wanted *-2 to come . N_S
41341:40	\[ What they did *T*-1 was , \+ Well , see what they did *T*-2 was , \] okay , \[ they , \+ uh , they \] wrote to all the initial people , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] oldest ones . E_S
41363:32	and , you know , they told them that what we had *-1 to do *T*-2 was when we sent back in our information *T*-3 , we had *-4 to tell them how many people *T*-5 were going *-6 to be coming , you know . E_S
41363:60	and , you know , they told them that what we had *-1 to do *T*-2 was when we sent back in our information *T*-3 , we had *-4 to tell them how many people *T*-5 were going *-6 to be coming , you know . E_S
41363:106	and , you know , they told them that what we had *-1 to do *T*-2 was when we sent back in our information *T*-3 , we had *-4 to tell them how many people *T*-5 were going *-6 to be coming , you know . E_S
41370:30	And then , \[ when they , \+ when they \] talked to us *T*-1 or when they sent us the letter *T*-2 , \[ it , \+ \] uh , you know , * to get the information and all , it asked , you know , will you be willing *-3 to bring E_S
41370:55	And then , \[ when they , \+ when they \] talked to us *T*-1 or when they sent us the letter *T*-2 , \[ it , \+ \] uh , you know , * to get the information and all , it asked , you know , will you be willing *-3 to bring E_S
41374:27	and you had *-1 to check off what all you would be willing *-2 to bring *T*-3 . E_S
41387:72	But , it turned out so much better like that . Because \[ everybody knew , \+ they knew \] ahead of time how many people *-2 to expect *T*-1 . E_S
41429:47	\[ I , \+ I 'm \] kind of like , in control over who *ICH*-2 *T*-1 comes . Uh , just from my family . E_S
41508:32	I was just thinking of \[ that . \+ What \] you could tell your kids *T*-1 . E_S
41524:18	but I ca n't remember who it was about *T*-1 . E_S
41525:17	My grandparents told us when I was growing up *T*-1 and even when I was an adult *T*-2 E_S
41525:42	My grandparents told us when I was growing up *T*-1 and even when I was an adult *T*-2 E_S
41528:19	but I have no idea who it was *T*-1 that *T*-2 was in those stories . E_S
41533:21	I could n't tell my kids what , you know , those people were like *T*-1 , E_S
41535:18	but I do n't know who it was *T*-1 . E_S
41541:13	but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents *T*-1 , then \[ you can find out from , \+ you know , you can find somebody \] else that *T*-2 can tell you something else about these , E_S
41547:4	what do you usually wear *T*-1 to work ? . E_S
41567:54	I know 0 many people are \[ co- , \+ very comfortable \] in the classroom and what have *T*-1 you *-2 wearing pants . E_S
41580:34	\[ we- , \+ you \] can pretty much wear whatever you want *-1 to *?* *T*-2 , E_S
41581:25	and I wear anything from jeans , when I 'm feeling really casual *T*-1 to , uh , suits and dresses when I 'm meeting with a customer *T*-2 E_S
41581:64	and I wear anything from jeans , when I 'm feeling really casual *T*-1 to , uh , suits and dresses when I 'm meeting with a customer *T*-2 E_S
41583:10	and so when I 'm teaching a class *T*-1 , obviously I wear a suit or dress , E_S
41587:47	so . \[ It , \+ it , \] uh , definitely fluctuates mainly with what I 'm going *-1 to be doing *T*-2 that day and kind of what my mood is *T*-3 E_S
41587:89	so . \[ It , \+ it , \] uh , definitely fluctuates mainly with what I 'm going *-1 to be doing *T*-2 that day and kind of what my mood is *T*-3 E_S
41591:7	and when it 's raining *T*-1 , I 'm more likely *-2 to wear jeans E_S
41594:21	\[ and , \+ and \] when it 's really cold *T*-1 I 'm more likely *-2 to wear jeans or pants or sweaters , or that type of thing . E_S
41599:25	and then , you know , obviously when I 'm doing anything that I 'm in front of people *T*-2 , \[ or , \+ or \] making presentations , teaching , whatever *T*-3 . I 'm going *-1 to dress up more . E_S
41605:8	because when you do have *-1 to be in front of people *T*-2 , uh , I think 0 *T*-3 \[ you , \+ \] \[ the , \+ the \] tendency there is * to wear dresses and suits \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , more classical style of clothing . E_S
41647:11	that 's what I 've seen *T*-1 . E_S
41662:28	\[ And , \+ uh , so , \] when we are doing wardrobing *T*-1 and we have , uh , \[ two , \+ two \] hour classes in wardrobe , we do discuss a great deal , the mini skirt and the types of clothes 0 * to wear *T*-2 on the job . E_S
41682:59	\[ And , \+ and \] \[ then , \+ uh , then \] you 're in the situation where you 're very unhappy *T*-1 . E_S
41685:33	Well I feel like too , on the job , when , you know , there 's men around and some of the managers are men *T*-1 , \[ you just , \+ you know , you \] do n't want them looking at your legs necessarily . E_S
41693:7	even when they was very , very popular *T*-2 in the early sixties , E_S
41698:48	again maybe because I was at the school , there were still many teachers who *T*-2 wore mini skirts , E_S
41708:24	Because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts *T*-1 . E_S
41712:154	And so , I think , uh , uh , of course , now I go the other extreme , 0 I do not like *-1 to see , in the corporate areas , uh , all the women dressed *-2 like men , with the suits and , uh , white shirts and ties and what have *T*-3 you so that they all look exactly the same . E_S
41741:42	I think that \[ you , \+ you \] make of that what you wish *T*-1 E_S
41742:57	and you can go the opposite direction and , uh , over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you *T*-1 , which *T*-2 do n't belong \[ in the , \+ \[ in , \+ at least in my opinion , in the \] \] work place , E_S
41742:72	and you can go the opposite direction and , uh , over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you *T*-1 , which *T*-2 do n't belong \[ in the , \+ \[ in , \+ at least in my opinion , in the \] \] work place , E_S
41747:63	you can have a classical look without \[ a lot of , \+ a great deal of \] adornment and what have you *T*-1 and still be very feminine . E_S
41765:39	uh , and so , then I , of course , just continued what I considered *T*-1 the best style of clothing for me at work E_S
41766:114	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] I find 0 \[ even , \+ even \] at home here now , \[ I , I \] will wear blue jeans or I 'll wear shorts and what have you *T*-1 , uh , and be very comfortable E_S
41767:7	but when I go out somewhere *T*-1 , then , uh , unless I have a pair of dress slacks , I do n't usually wear a lot of blue jeans . E_S
41782:83	that 's \[ what I , \+ one thing 0 I \] like *T*-2 about T I is that they are n't overly strict about what you wear *T*-3 E_S
41787:103	I mean , \[ they , \+ they \] leave it up to you and your judgment * \[ to , \+ to \] use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have *T*-1 . E_S
41814:51	and sometimes I think 0 you may be more productive if you 're comfortable with what you 're wearing *T*-1 and can \[ \[ be , \+ be , \] \+ feel \] more relaxed .
41819:22	and , you know , like when I 'm writing training material *T*-1 , I prefer *-2 to be more comfortable unless I know 0 I have *-3 to meet with a customer later during the day . E_S
41825:56	I do know 0 there 's a lot of companies that *T*-1 are very strict about what the employees wear *T*-2 E_S
41838:89	But , uh , \[ I , \+ I , \] uh , did have a group come over from one of the banks , over the children 's hospital where I was volunteering *T*-1 E_S

41891:35	\[ How do yo- , \+ \[ wh- , \+ what \] do you \] think *T*-1 about it . E_S
41930:158	And one of \[ the things , \+ the questions \] the other day , this last paper , and I have n't seen the results of it , I 'm anxious *-1 to *?* , was do you think that , um , capital punishment ought *-3 to apply to drug dealers . Which I thought 0 *T*-2 was a real interesting question . E_S
41960:31	You know , I think 0 that 's what it 's going *-1 to take *T*-2 , though . E_S
42150:21	Uh , I ca n't remember what the town was *T*-1 , some little area . E_S
42156:16	and that 's maybe what you were talking about *T*-1 . E_S
42192:74	and they 're all like , um , like \[ ni- , \+ anywhere from nine \] to twelve years old , I think is what they 've been *T*-1 . E_S
42260:72	\[ and , \+ uh . And \] she was like oh God , he does this all the time , you know , where are you *T*-1 . you know , *-2 screaming , J D E_S
42336:17	And if they find who *T*-1 's doing that to those little girls , as far as I 'm concerned he could , fry . E_S
42369:50	and \[ I do n't know what *-1 to , \+ I do n't know what *T*-2 needs *-3 to \] be done *-4 , you know E_S
42378:156	and he said 0 \[ you can pretty much , \+ you know \[ if you ever get on a jury , \+ you know , you 're not told *-1 this , but if you ever get on a jury \] you can pretty much \] guess , 0 whatever you sentence them to *T*-2 , E_S they 're going *-3 to serve about a quarter . E_S
42393:47	You know , because then they 'll serve fifteen or twenty , so . Which *T*-1 is really , N_S
42407:7	Well what are we going *-1 to do *T*-2 about it ? E_S
42408:24	\[ How , \+ I mean how \] can it be changed *-1 *T*-2 . \] Unless the legislature will do something E_S
42451:7	well what do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
42453:92	Well , \[ I 'm kind of leaning towards , \+ I do n't know , I 'm thinking about \] \[ what , \+ from one to ten what \] my no would be *T*-1 . E_S
42474:63	Because there has got *-1 to be some kind of background check * to see , that the people who *T*-2 are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose , you know ,
42496:34	\[ I , \+ I 'm \] not really sure what Texas law ,
42521:73	I do n't think 0 they 're going *-1 to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there 's a check *T*-2 , E_S
42533:38	like I say , I do n't think 0 the guy who *T*-1 's going *-2 to rob a Seven Eleven , is going *-3 to rob a Seven Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife , baseball bat , or , you know , whatever , E_S
42539:24	He 's going *-1 to do what he wants *-3 to do *T*-2 . E_S
42548:27	\[ And , \+ and \] the people who *T*-1 want it , it *EXP*-2 's not that big a deal , like I say , * to wait . E_S
42555:20	it makes you wonder , what they need it for *T*-1 all of a sudden here . Um , E_S
42615:35	I mean , there are a lot of kids who when they 're ten *T*-2 *T*-1 look like they 're twelve , or fourteen \[ or , \+ \[ and , \+ and , \] \] especially some of the minority children . Whether , you know a racist or not , E_S

42637:25	Because there 's been kids that age who *T*-1 have killed people . E_S
42641:85	And , you know , you know , there was a law \[ in , \+ I think 0 it 's *RNR*-2 in \] Oregon , where they 've now made all toy guns *T*-1 , E_S
42697:25	And , the police love it . E_S Which *T*-1 really surprised me E_S
42701:54	\[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ I think , and \] 0 that 's what they were going after *T*-1 , uh ,
42725:21	I learned *-1 to shoot when I was real little *T*-2 . E_S
42729:92	I think 0 that 's a lot of it too , is that people need *-1 to teach their kids , \[ what * not to , \+ what * to do *T*-2 \] and what * not to do *T*-3 . E_S

42736:74	Because \[ I started *-2 shooting , \+ my Dad started *-3 letting me shoot \] like a little air B B gun , when I was probably five or six years old *T*-1 . E_S

42774:55	it 's like , \[ it 's * do n't , \+ \] you know , when you 're climbing over a barbed wire fence *T*-1 , * do n't point , lean your gun against it , you know , E_S

42928:39	it was a lot easier \[ when I was , \+ when I was \] single *T*-2 , E_S

43694:4	When they 're so cheap *ICH*-1 too at the video stores that you can . N_S
43754:49	And \[ I , \+ I 've \] been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur 's castle was *T*-1 . E_S

43822:5	where I lived *T*-1 . Uh , it was a little town called * Newmarket . About seventy miles north of London . E_S

43890:23	That 's what they *T*-2 when the thing has n't won any award *T*-1 . E_S
43917:34	I mean , there 's a lot of reasons why I do n't go to movies *T*-1 . E_S
43922:11	But people who *T*-1 bring kids irritates the heck out of me . E_S
43933:5	when she called me , the computer called me *T*-1 , I thought that they were reading my mind . E_S
43938:92	Uh , painting is not hard 0 * to do *T*-1 , uh , as long as it 's \[ not in , \+ not to \] the point of where it 's , uh , needs *-2 to be scraped *-3 and \[ bl- , \+ \] peeling *T*-4 , E_S

44024:4	which *T*-1 might be a bigger problem than it would be , uh , N_S
44044:14	and , um , when we bought it *T*-1 \[ the , \+ \] um , it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired , MUMBLEx E_S
44051:19	The only problem was 0 when we started *-1 having the movers move the furniture in *T*-2 we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on \[ the wood- , \+ uh , the \] door frames , E_S
44055:5	when we took the masking tape off *T*-1 half the painted came with it . E_S
44060:7	So what *T*-1 had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly . E_S

44092:11	we know what a job it 's going *-1 to be *T*-2 E_S
44110:9	So , how do you feel *T*-1 about our policy in Latin America ? . E_S
44144:54	I just get sorry feelings for people that *T*-1 their family came from there and how they feel *T*-2 about , you know , our intervention and their government and stuff like that , E_S

44161:16	\[ Why , \+ why \] should we be the ones that *T*-1 have *-2 to do it *T*-3 and things like that E_S

44225:26	so , uh I do n't know really what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen . E_S
44276:49	I think , uh , 0 Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive *T*-2 , you know , where it 's always the minority that *T*-1 \[ are , \+ are \] trying *-4 to make the country better *T*-3 . E_S

44307:13	I mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they do n't understand when anything is being said *-1 *T*-4 \[ yet they 're , \+ yet they 're \] expected *-2 to bow down to it *T*-5 , I think 0 *T*-3 that keeps people in sort of line , you know . E_S
44307:69	I mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they do n't understand when anything is being said *-1 *T*-4 \[ yet they 're , \+ yet they 're \] expected *-2 to bow down to it *T*-5 , I think 0 *T*-3 that keeps people in sort of line , you know . E_S
44310:16	Do they even understand what *T*-1 's being said *-2 ? E_S
44312:22	Well , \[ when , \+ when \] it use *-1 to be Latin *T*-2 . E_S
44324:4	Which *T*-1 it 's not that way now E_S
44328:17	it is in America where it was hard *T*-1 E_S
44344:69	So , um , \[ I , \+ I \] just think 0 that has something 0 *T*-1 to do with why Latinos \[ or , \+ \] tend *-2 to be , you know , \[ the mee- , \+ the more meek *T*-3 , \] you know , E_S
44349:22	They 're not really sure of what they are *T*-1 . I do n't think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
44353:19	Well , I mean , how , can you contrast the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights \[ to , \+ to \] say the people in Latin America *T*-1 . E_S
44356:33	I mean , \[ why are they , \+ why are they \] not as vocal *T*-1 E_S
44357:6	or why do they not , you know , stand up , * so to speak , for their rights *T*-1 ? E_S
44371:51	and yet , you know , they have the same problem where , you know , where kings and such , N_S
44386:8	So , what 's the difference *T*-1 ? E_S
44393:6	So what *T*-1 makes the difference between , say \[ South America and the rest , \+ I mean , South Africa and \[ it is \+ \] rest of Africa ? \]
44420:47	actually \[ I , \+ I 've \] always wondered \[ whether , \+ how \] the education system works *T*-1 in the Russian countries , the Republics , you know . E_S
44475:63	\[ So , \+ you know , and \] \[ yet they , \+ yet people \] get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in *RNR*-4 and the Russians moving in *RNR*-4 certain areas of technology , you know , that we use *-1 to dominate *T*-3 *T*-2 E_S

44490:4	Where you from *T*-1 ? E_S
44532:4	What is she *T*-1 ? E_S
44548:44	And , uh , it *EXP*-2 's funny \[ how , \+ uh , how \] \[ I , \+ I , \] uh , \[ a- , \+ acquired \] this animal *T*-1 . E_S
44549:10	Uh , when I was , uh , married *T*-1 , my , uh , ex-wife had said that she had a friend who *T*-2 had a little puppy . That she needed , N_S uh , the woman needed someone 0 *T*-4 to baby-sit *T*-3 E_S

44567:38	and , uh , I find a little present on the floor sometimes when I come home *T*-1 . E_S
44640:68	Well , \[ \[ my , \+ my \] dog \+ \[ when I came home *T*-2 , \+ uh , when I come home \] in the evenings *T*-1 , my dog \] greets me at the door . E_S

44726:64	Plus , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ uh , the \] vet sent me a bill for what he did *T*-1 E_S

44827:4	What is that sound *T*-1 ? E_S
44854:16	And so they figure why *-2 go out and vote *T*-1 , you know . E_S
44855:24	They 're going *-1 to do what they want *-2 to do *T*-3 . E_S

44930:19	Well I do n't know how it is *T*-1 up there E_S

45029:139	and , uh , certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that , you know , \[ they , \+ they \] understood that the principles of the country were established *-1 so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant *T*-2 E_S
45061:23	but they have *-1 to do whatever these people , whichever one the other people elect *T*-2 do *T*-3 . E_S
45061:36	but they have *-1 to do whatever these people , whichever one the other people elect *T*-2 do *T*-3 . E_S
45066:36	but you 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do what that person says *T*-3 , E_S
45078:76	They would put them *-4 to realize \[ that , \+ that \] they 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do what someone else says *T*-5 even though they did n't vote for it . And that maybe they need *-3 to think twice about *-6 voting . E_S
45095:128	and , uh , I do think 0 more needs *-2 to be done *-3 along that line * to help * to , uh , teach the \[ people , \+ uh , uh , everyone , \] uh , more about what *T*-1 is going on with voting and with nonvoting . So that , uh , \[ we can make , \+ they 're making \] some more intelligent decisions . E_S
45105:39	Well , you know , they 'd have *-1 to start when they 're real young *T*-2 . E_S
45111:93	\[ Whenever , \+ the first time \] 0 I voted *T*-2 , I never voted in high school because there was never anyone that *T*-1 showed us how * to use the voting machines *T*-3 , E_S
45116:18	but I did not know how * to use those voting machines *T*-1 E_S
45129:143	And \[ it took me , \+ I mean it *EXP*-3 took \] such courage 0 you would n't believe *T*-1 * to go *-4 vote the first time because I was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because I did n't know how * to work the machines *T*-2 . E_S
45146:25	And , uh , I did n't know how *-2 to work the machine , you know *T*-1 . E_S
45147:85	And it really scared me , really bad . E_S Because I thought all these people are going *-1 to laugh at me because I do n't know how * to work this machine *T*-3 . E_S
45157:54	I \[ s- , \+ \] asked him something about well \[ did you , \+ who did you \] vote \[ for *T*-1 , \+ for , \] uh , cheerleader ? E_S
45161:7	so when we went and voted the next time *T*-1 , I asked the , uh , lady ,
45163:23	and she said well , uh , why , you know . E_S
45165:32	I said because I want him to know how * to use one of these *T*-2 E_S
45170:26	but I want *-1 to show him how * to use it *T*-3 so that he 'll be able *-2 to vote . E_S
45210:9	Oh , what kind is it *T*-1 ? E_S
45227:55	We have two Chows and , , a miniature Schnauzer , and recently added , a guinea pig , , which *T*-1 was n't by my choice , E_S
45241:32	so \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] what *T*-1 matters . E_S
45252:72	but I 'm kind of concerned about , um , \[ with \+ \] *-2 having cats , and \[ how , \+ how \] they socialize with cats *T*-4 . Um , which *T*-1 is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed *T*-3 . E_S

45366:48	But I think 0 it really helps them to understand \[ when , \+ when \] they go to other people 's houses *T*-1 E_S

45548:26	but we never even thought that about when we got the dog *T*-1 E_S

45749:4	What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S
45751:4	Who 's their quarterback *T*-1 ? E_S
45773:41	because , * got teams \[ like , \+ like \] Buffalo who *T*-1 \[ were n't , \+ certainly were n't \] a powerhouse , uh , ten years ago . E_S
45805:17	\[ what , \+ what \] kind of , uh , uh , N_S
45854:5	when he bought the team and all *T*-1 \[ and \+ \] it just seemed like he just decided , you know , this is the way 0 it 's going *-2 to be *T*-3 E_S
45877:14	Because * look how good we did *T*-1 without a quarterback this year . E_S
45880:4	Who was the quarterback *T*-1 ? E_S
45884:27	See , I ca n't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback , is *T*-1 . E_S
45919:9	Well , when is the , N F L draft *T*-1 E_S
45945:41	But , I do n't know whether they 'll be far enough up where they can do any good *T*-1 . E_S
45968:11	you remember when Archie Manning was a quarterback *T*-1 ? E_S
46038:10	Uh , when I can *?* *T*-1 . E_S
46089:57	I \[ went to , \+ got *-1 to go to \] a Bills game this year , which *T*-2 was fun . E_S
46090:40	It was \[ the , \+ the \] Bills , Eagles game , which appropriately enough fortunately , the Bills won *T*-1 . E_S
46122:19	now I do n't know how it will be *T*-1 this year , you know , E_S
46131:19	it was right close to when we was going *-1 to find out if we was going *-2 to get *-3 to be in the playoffs , or not *T*-4 . E_S
46224:96	but , \[ I , \+ you know , I 'm \] real concerned that \[ I , \+ I \] do n't want *-1 to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that *T*-2 , E_S
46239:42	well \[ I , \+ I \] went to Dallas , uh , when I worked for T I in Abilene *T*-1 E_S
46247:23	You know because to me where we live *T*-1 out here in the north east , \[ \[ it , \+ it 's \] \+ \] there are a lot of buildings very close to each other , E_S
46251:31	and the cities are very populated with tenement housing , where there are more than one family in a house *T*-1 .
46292:70	\[ and , \+ and \] I do n't know if it 's , uh , the family , you know , thing where they 're not bonding anymore *T*-1 , where mothers are working all the time and , the kids are n't getting the attention that they need *T*-2 *T*-3 , or the television . E_S

46317:46	in fact on the news last night we were watching this , uh , man who *T*-1 lost his ten year old daughter . E_S
46326:11	that 's what it was *T*-1 . E_S
46327:19	And , uh , someone who *T*-1 was in the neighborhood *-2 cleaning carpets , these two men , went in , raped the girl , murdered her , and the whole bit . E_S
46347:27	And I mean , I think that what this is going *-1 to lead to *T*-2 is 0 people will take things into their own hands . And that innocent people , N_S
46360:8	Sometimes when you lose someone that you really love *T*-1 *T*-2 , you do some crazy things E_S
46390:24	I mean they go right back where they came from *T*-1 . E_S
46404:73	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't consider Mexican people in the same category with , uh , especially like , uh , people who *T*-1 come from cultures that *T*-2 do n't have the same , uh , kind of moral upbringing that we have *T*-3 . E_S
46411:39	Like you take Asian countries , or , uh , the Eastern countries where women are like \[ in the foreground , \+ uh , in the background \] and the men are in the foreground *T*-1 , E_S
46415:58	and it 's like , you know , um , they live back in \[ whe- , \+ where \] we came from *T*-1 two hundred years ago . E_S
46424:11	you know what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
46443:51	and he turned and asked this girl , and said , can you think of any place where Dana should n't go *T*-1 by herself , or anything . E_S
46479:21	well , \[ wh- , \+ what *T*-1 's \] the difference there , E_S
46482:16	I 'm not sure what it is *T*-1 there . E_S
46483:20	Now , I know 0 what it is *T*-1 in Singapore , is 0 they have the death penalty E_S
46523:21	but I think 0 people who *T*-1 are guilty of really serious heinous crimes , do not deserve *-3 to be cared for *-2 for the rest of their lives . E_S
46586:4	what do they get paid *T*-1 . E_S
46611:69	but \[ they , \+ they 're \] already , uh , have \[ str- , \+ three strikes \] against them when they 're out there *T*-1 . E_S
46616:30	and you have *-1 to even be careful how you arrest them *T*-4 , how you talk to them *T*-3 , uh , you know , what they say *T*-2 , E_S
46616:49	and you have *-1 to even be careful how you arrest them *T*-4 , how you talk to them *T*-3 , uh , you know , what they say *T*-2 , E_S

46742:30	if you had a choice of your car , what would you get *T*-1 ? E_S
46762:16	I do n't know how *-2 to explain *T*-1 ,

46774:38	\[ Astro , \+ Astro , \] I guess , is what it ,
46802:10	well , when I bought my car *T*-1 , it was right out of college E_S
46812:39	\[ so , \+ so , \] I think 0 that 's what , uh , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] going *-1 to have *-2 to get *T*-4 next time around ,
46851:11	* Wonder what *T*-1 happened . E_S

47224:17	\[ What , \+ what 's \] it *EXP*-2 like *T*-1 * camping in the desert and California , E_S
47239:38	I think 0 the desert has a rare kind of beauty which , uh , a lot of people do n't realize *T*-1 , E_S
47267:76	I mean , \[ you got *-1 to , \+ you sort of have *-2 to \] choose your season carefully and know what *T*-3 's going *-4 to happen . E_S
47291:36	I \[ do n't know , \+ do n't know \] when I 'm going *-1 to get a chance *-2 to do that *T*-3 E_S

47312:36	It *ICH*-2 's just amazing , \[ how , \+ how \] much you miss *T*-1 . E_S

47346:4	what baseball team are you familiar with *T*-1 ? E_S
47360:46	I guess 0 they paired two women together on this call for a reason which *T*-1 is something 0 we can think about *T*-2 later E_S

47415:100	\[ speaking of Bush , \+ we 're going *-1 to get a little off topic but * speaking of Bush , \] \[ they \+ that \] had a story where he went *-2 to visit some little , uh , elementary school students , and stuff *T*-3 . E_S

47466:26	maybe it was the other New York team which *T*-1 is the Yankees , E_S
47489:12	This is how much *ICH*-2 I know *T*-1 about baseball . E_S
47497:94	We got free tickets because \[ someone at our church , \+ one of the deacons at church , \] um , parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek which *T*-1 is like one of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] places and stuff . E_S
47553:33	I know 0 I 'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game *T*-1 . E_S

47885:4	How much time did she spend *T*-1 with them ? E_S
47919:34	but I feel like , I do n't know , when I have children *T*-1 I want *-2 to be able *-3 to spend a lot of time with them . E_S
47927:6	And what are you studying *T*-1 ? E_S
47939:10	seem , when I was growing up *T*-1 my Mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high . E_S
47954:7	and when I was younger *T*-1 I thought 0 they were lucky because they got *-2 to get away with things , like I could n't ride my bike across the street , but they could *?* because their Mom would never know it . E_S

47976:76	\[ so , \+ so , \] you would have a job with a company ? Rather than , uh , radio or television or newspapers or , what have you *T*-1 . E_S

48003:55	and in that case then \[ I 'll be , \+ I 'll be \] at home when my children are at home *T*-1 , E_S

48034:4	What did you teach *T*-1 ? E_S
48069:92	and so , he thought surely that \[ I , \+ or I \] would have bought a hot line , *-1 to know if he ever skipped school , which , of course , *T*-2 was not the case E_S
48080:47	Uh , I listened to more than one parent say I do n't know what this child wants *T*-1 . E_S
48087:19	I 'd say , but what they do n't have *T*-1 is you . E_S
48096:13	Well , see whenever my Mom stayed home with us *T*-1 , we did without a lot , E_S
48143:45	And , uh , while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child 's in the elementary school *T*-1 E_S and they get into the high schools so often they seem *-1 to drop away at that point . E_S
48167:72	So , \[ wh- , \+ \] I feel that I learned a great deal from my students , uh , with regard to what their biggest complaints *ICH*-2 were *T*-1 with parents . E_S
48172:5	when I was your age *T*-1 I did n't have this or that , E_S

48214:14	Well , Stephanie , what 's your position on gun control *T*-1 ? E_S
48252:70	I guess 0 I would tend myself *-1 to be more towards \[ the , \+ the , \] like three , where I do n't think 0 you should necessarily ban guns \[ any , \+ by any \] means *T*-2 , E_S
48264:67	\[ I , \+ I \] think that \[ the , \+ the \] law \[ is \+ \] on who *T*-1 can buy a gun \[ are , \+ are \] way too lax . E_S
48276:54	\[ I , \+ you know , I 'm \] trying *-1 to think of how many times you make the statement *T*-2 \[ and , \+ \] just to kind of exam it a little bit E_S
48280:79	I guess 0 I have never heard of \[ a , \+ a \] robbery being foiled *-1 or spoiled *-1 because the person who *T*-2 's being robbed *-3 had a gun . E_S
48286:71	or , you know , I ca n't think of *-1 ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who *T*-2 was being robbed *-3 E_S

48339:27	But I think that if I learn how *-1 to use one *T*-2 , \[ I would , \+ I would \] feel better . E_S
48342:62	I 've also always thought about the idea 0 , you know , most sports , you know , which *T*-1 are
48346:21	you could n't be inconspicuous , when you walked into a store stuff like that *T*-1 , E_S
48358:43	But I guess * to make it more difficult for the person who *T*-1 's just so irate and upset and , you know , temporarily a little bit , uh , offset or off keel , N_S
48362:36	like today they just introduced \[ the , \+ \] what *T*-1 's called *-2 the Brady bill . The seven day mandatory waiting period , on * getting any guns . E_S
48422:33	uh , but it does have a word processing program , which all of us have used *T*-1 for \[ re- , \+ reports \] and papers and that sort of thing . E_S
48426:5	when this subject was mentioned *-1 to us *T*-3 I said , well , E_S I went , gee , that 's all 0 I use mine for *T*-2 is a word processor , E_S
48466:38	But you do have *-1 to research that , find out what *T*-2 works for your system . E_S
48467:4	What kind do you have *T*-1 ? E_S
48502:74	and we use the computers a great deal for word processing , you know , because students really do seem *-1 to be freer when they write on the computer *T*-2 , as you probably found out yourself , E_S
48568:20	I know some people \[ who *T*-1 just , \+ \] E_S
48581:11	I knew what you meant *T*-1 , E_S
48601:13	well , especially when anyone who *T*-1 's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering \[ w- , \+ uh , \[ dr- , \+ drawing *T*-2 , \] \] um , N_S
48650:42	So \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] even know how much , um , personal computers cost *T*-1 nowadays . E_S
48683:53	and so , you know , \[ we are , \+ we are \] limited , which *T*-1 may be one reason why , N_S
48699:29	but we 've been able *-1 to do what we can *?* *T*-2 . E_S
48746:47	but like I say , she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wanted *T*-1 . E_S
48780:4	Which program did you use *T*-1 ? E_S
48830:19	I 'm not really sure what the exact , uh , specifications are *T*-1 for Texas . E_S
48844:113	uh , you know , \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-5 \] really irks me * to see so much effort put *-1 into * preventing someone being put *-2 to death by the State when they so callously and usually \[ so , \+ \] you know , without *-3 even thinking or without any concern , uh , you know , end somebody else 's life , and in a lot of cases several people 's lives *T*-6 . E_S
48848:14	I can see where if a life was taken *-1 by accident or , uh , I do n't know what you 'd call it *T*-2 , not premeditated or , I guess primarily by accident , , uh *T*-5 , there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for *-3 *T*-4 , E_S
48848:140	I can see where if a life was taken *-1 by accident or , uh , I do n't know what you 'd call it *T*-2 , not premeditated or , I guess primarily by accident , , uh *T*-5 , there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for *-3 *T*-4 , E_S
48857:58	\[ If , \+ if \] you 've got a guy \[ who 's , \+ who *T*-1 's \] been to trial and has been in and out of jail , you know , basically \[ a , \+ a \] three time loser for the twelfth time , you know , and he goes out and kills somebody , he 's not going *-2 to be reformed *-3 , E_S
48869:22	I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 aggravates a lot of people , is 0 somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty , E_S
48870:78	and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who *T*-1 was out in six months . . E_S
48888:131	You know , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] no kind of deterrent because \[ we , \+ we 've \] got literally hundreds of people on death row , \[ and , \+ and \] many of them who *T*-1 have been there *ICH*-2 for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row , E_S
48893:33	and I would tend *-1 to agree with anybody who *T*-2 says right now that \[ it , \+ it 's \] not \[ a terrent , \+ a deterrent , \] because it 's not *?* . E_S
48905:14	and that 's where a lot of aggravation comes *T*-1 , I think , \[ is , \+ is , \] uh , these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process , E_S
48975:118	And , you know , \[ the , \+ like you say , the \] cops that *T*-1 are out *-2 doing the work , day by day have got *-3 to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work , basically go out the window *T*-4 . E_S
49045:24	It 's a two story colonial , which my wife and I designed *T*-1 . E_S
49084:28	Well , do you mind if I ask what it 's worth *T*-1 down there , E_S
49085:14	I mean , what it 's , N_S
49088:5	when we built it ten years ago *T*-1 , \[ it was , \+ it ran \] around a hundred and forty thousand dollars . E_S
49241:4	Where are you *T*-1 in relation to Sevren ? E_S
49266:7	and when they left the area *T*-1 they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand . E_S
49279:45	for example there is a , uh , condominium complex next to the apartment complex where I live *T*-1 , E_S
49281:30	And ninety-two thousand dollars for a two bedroom , which *T*-1 is essentially a two bedroom apartment . N_S
49313:85	\[ \[ on a , \+ on a , \] \+ on a , \] N_S \[ what we would , \+ you know , what you \] described *T*-2 as your house and what I would describe *T*-1 as my house E_S say , for example , in Pensacola , Florida , on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on , * might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes .
49313:112	\[ \[ on a , \+ on a , \] \+ on a , \] N_S \[ what we would , \+ you know , what you \] described *T*-2 as your house and what I would describe *T*-1 as my house E_S say , for example , in Pensacola , Florida , on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on , * might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes .
49356:4	Why is that *T*-1 ? E_S
49373:19	I was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the , Montgomery County Public Schools makes , N_S
49391:5	What kind of a car do you drive *T*-1 now ? E_S
49420:31	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] like where all the controls \[ \[ are \+ *T*-1
49447:4	What did you have *T*-1 before you bought that . E_S
49464:84	The only problems 0 I had *T*-1 with it in the nine years that I owned it *T*-2 , I had *-3 to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old *T*-4 . E_S
49491:30	And so I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the Honda *T*-1 E_S
49496:23	well , N_S I kind of know how * to drive standard *T*-1 E_S
49518:11	that 's why I got the Honda *T*-1 . E_S
49545:28	and I anticipate the same thing with the Honda whenever I decide *-1 to sell it *T*-2 , E_S
49554:11	That 's what I did *T*-1 with the Mazda , * drive it \[ until the , \+ until the \] clutch went out and the wheels fell off , E_S
49588:16	So , that 's how I ended up with a Honda *T*-1 . E_S
49590:27	I was n't even looking for a car when I bought this car *T*-1 . E_S
49591:58	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] was thinking about *-1 buying a Prelude from a friend who *T*-2 was moving to New York or something E_S
49682:36	but \[ I just , \+ I \] worry about who *T*-1 's driven them and what they 've been through *T*-2 and the warranties and things like that . E_S
49682:55	but \[ I just , \+ I \] worry about who *T*-1 's driven them and what they 've been through *T*-2 and the warranties and things like that . E_S
49692:16	and you can request whatever maintenance records *T*-1 exist on cars E_S
49785:15	Oh , is that where you are *T*-1 now ? E_S
49792:29	and , uh , uh , I guess 0 when you 're down here in Dallas *T*-2 you finally get indoctrinated *-1 into the Cowboys um , because , uh , you know this *ICH*-3 is a big football territory down here . E_S
49811:21	and you do n't back them when they 're not doing well *T*-1 . E_S
49828:13	and this is when Schramm was still there *T*-1 . E_S
49832:47	And , um , they 'd go after them *-1 saying , uh , jeez what you really need *T*-2 is a defensive end . E_S
49834:24	and \[ when they , \+ when they \] drafted somebody *T*-1 and he did n't work out at that spot *T*-1 it really was n't a good enough athlete 0 * to move *T*-2 to any place else . E_S
49862:6	or what was the whole deal on that *T*-1 ? E_S
49881:4	What was I thinking *T*-1 . E_S
49903:39	but \[ I , \+ I \] guess , uh , 0 when you have a whole bunch of , uh , professional athletes that *T*-1 get together at the beginning of the year *T*-2 everybody 's got great hopes . E_S
49953:34	D C is like talking about \[ how , \+ how \] they 're going *-1 to get a baseball team and everything *T*-2 . E_S
49960:192	But , of course , you know , \[ \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the one , \] \+ the \] griping is that \[ \[ if , \+ you know , if , \] \+ if \] Washington does n't get \[ a , \+ uh , a \] baseball team then Baltimore should n't get a football team . Which *T*-1 is probably true , E_S
49982:25	well , considering \[ how , \+ how \] well he gets along with , uh , Jimmy Johnson *T*-1 that does n't surprise me . E_S
49993:26	I guess 0 it was January , when , um , Jimmy Johnson got named *-1 coach of the year or whatever *T*-2 . E_S
50016:13	do you know what Ellicott City is *T*-1 ? E_S
50034:19	that 's not far from where \[ the , \+ uh , the \] new football stadium would be *T*-1 if we got an N F L team . E_S
50044:4	what do they , N_S
50059:53	and they 're building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the Inner Harbor , which *T*-1 is really \+ stupid because one of the big selling points of the new stadium is supposed *-2 to be this view of the Inner Harbor E_S
50074:14	I tell you what I , N_S
50094:44	And , um , I was not real happy \[ when , \+ uh , when \] they , uh , left *-1 to \[ go , \+ go \] there of all places *T*-2 . E_S
50126:9	Well , what do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S
50153:112	And , uh , \[ I just , \+ I \] heard a comment *ICH*-3 on the radio this morning that , uh , you know , \[ it , \+ it \] gets to a point where , uh , if enough people \[ are , \+ are \] going *-1 to be slaughtered *-2 over there over \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] internal problems , um , somebody may step in again *T*-4 . E_S
50332:14	And , uh , what *T*-1 's right is wrong
50333:7	and what *T*-2 's wrong is right in some cases . E_S
50444:42	I mean * \[ looks who *T*-2 's , \+ looks who *T*-1 's \] getting the engineering degrees and the , the math and the science and everything . E_S
50452:72	You know , \[ we , \+ we 've \] got folks running around here \[ who *T*-1 get , \+ who *T*-2 get \] degrees in basket weaving and you know , underwater psychology , or \[ some , \+ some \] ridiculous stuff like that . E_S
50461:20	\[ And , \+ and \] where are the engineers coming from *T*-1 ? E_S
50486:62	And the only reason 0 he came here *T*-1 was because the education is so much better for those who *T*-2 will go after it . E_S
50511:16	I do n't know what we 're going *-1 to do *T*-2 as a country . E_S
50539:16	I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
50628:43	\[ I , \+ uh , years ago , I remember 0 *T*-2 when I \] had a T I ninety-nine *T*-1 . * Put all the money into the expansion box and all this , that and the other E_S
50662:27	you know , \[ what- , \+ whatever \] *T*-1 works for you . E_S
50666:59	And , uh , if it does the job , then \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] what you need *T*-1 . E_S
50678:4	What do you think *T*-1 about the , uh , Peace Corps or public service commitment ? E_S
50684:42	Well , I think 0 it was , uh , thought *-1 up when there was so much controversy about * reviving a draft *T*-2 E_S
50685:47	and people said , well , \[ they , \+ uh , young people \] who *T*-1 were drafted *-2 have *-3 to provide military service to the country , E_S
50686:30	but there are an awful lot of young people who *T*-1 would benefit from , um , some sort of public service , like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or , uh , various other things of that sort . E_S
50691:21	but I do n't quite see how they 'd make it work *T*-1 . E_S
50695:4	How would they decide who *T*-1 goes into , uh , * building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who *T*-2 goes to Saudi Arabia *T*-3 ? E_S
50695:18	How would they decide who *T*-1 goes into , uh , * building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who *T*-2 goes to Saudi Arabia *T*-3 ? E_S
50695:63	How would they decide who *T*-1 goes into , uh , * building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who *T*-2 goes to Saudi Arabia *T*-3 ? E_S
50705:34	And I think 0 there are some available now where they are able *-1 to work *T*-2 , E_S
50713:13	And the people who *T*-1 were proposing it said that it should be involuntary , that it should be like a draft . E_S
50724:59	I assume 0 it 's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do *T*-3 , when people were drafted *-4 and they refused *-1 to serve in the Army *T*-2 , E_S
50761:14	You know , how you going *-2 to cover that many people *T*-1
50776:33	uh , even if it 's like the Peace Corps where they do n't get most of it until they come home *T*-2 , you \[ have * t- , \+ have *-3 to \] pay them something . E_S
50795:27	Now I had a lot of friends who *T*-1 went to the Peace Corps , uh , back in the mid sixties E_S
50800:30	but on the other hand , I 'm not sure what the permanent value of it was *T*-1 . E_S
50801:18	I do n't , know what we got *T*-1 for all the money . E_S
50805:28	We had an awful lot of idealistic people who *T*-1 went off to , uh , what *T*-2 was then East Pakistan is now Bangladesh , and to , uh , Algeria and to , uh , Southeast Asia and lots of , uh , out-of-the-way places . E_S
50805:53	We had an awful lot of idealistic people who *T*-1 went off to , uh , what *T*-2 was then East Pakistan is now Bangladesh , and to , uh , Algeria and to , uh , Southeast Asia and lots of , uh , out-of-the-way places . E_S
50809:45	But I do n't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went *T*-2 , in *-3 teaching the people how * to cope with their lives better *T*-1 . E_S
50809:76	But I do n't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went *T*-2 , in *-3 teaching the people how * to cope with their lives better *T*-1 . E_S
50846:18	But I do n't know what organization it 's under *T*-1 . E_S
50871:19	I 'm not so sure what kind of , uh , training *ICH*-2 that is *T*-1 for the future for those kids . E_S
50874:5	how much benefit , it 'll do them *T*-1 in the long run ? E_S
50918:80	uh , E_S the special on channel thirteen that *T*-2 was broadcast *-1 , I think *RNR*-3 , last week or so ago , it detailed how this one person went about *-6 finding out \[ this particular pers- , \+ from this particular person \] his home mortgage , how much he pays *T*-4 for it , what his payments are *T*-5 , uh , his , uh , Social Security number , driver 's license , any kind of records 0 he may have *T*-7 .

50920:4	What *T*-1 was the reason why somebody was trying *-2 to find out all that stuff *T*-3 ? E_S
50920:21	What *T*-1 was the reason why somebody was trying *-2 to find out all that stuff *T*-3 ? E_S
50922:41	It was just as a demonstration 0 *T*-1 to show those who *T*-2 were watching it how easily obtainable information *ICH*-3 is *T*-4 on any single person . E_S

50935:11	That 's how they obtain information about segments of society and group them into age brackets , uh , their habits , their hobbies , their income *T*-1 . E_S
50953:4	where they have \[ the , \+ you know , the \] little partition dividers , throughout \[ a , \+ a \] large room *T*-1 E_S
50989:14	Is there anybody who *T*-1 does n't ? E_S
50995:44	\[ It 's , \+ I suppose 0 it \] depends on who you 're working for *T*-1 and where at *T*-2 . E_S
50995:66	\[ It 's , \+ I suppose 0 it \] depends on who you 're working for *T*-1 and where at *T*-2 . E_S
51033:9	Hum , what do you think 0 *T*-1 could be done *-2 about it ? E_S
51061:43	Well , \[ they take , \+ they take \] my name , which *T*-1 is a very common name , E_S
51096:13	Is that usually what you tell them *T*-1 in the letter ? E_S
51099:5	what I 've taken to *-1 doing *T*-2 lately is * calling the company that they report *T*-3 E_S
51116:13	So that 's what I 've taken to *-2 doing *T*-1 lately , E_S
51167:4	What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S
51178:18	and Frederick , um , which *T*-1 is also just west of Baltimore , has a minor league team . E_S
51206:29	that was impression 0 I got *T*-1 when I was there *T*-2 E_S
51227:16	I do n't understand why Encovilla got released *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
51235:4	Why * get rid *-1 of him now *T*-2 ? E_S
51260:33	But that does n't mean * get three other guys who *T*-1 hit ,
51261:60	all 0 they can do *T*-2 is *-3 hit home runs and strike out you know , which they did *T*-4 . E_S
51293:9	Uh , who 's the last one *T*-1 . E_S
51338:7	MUMBLEx How far is Houston *T*-1 ? E_S
51343:18	* keep *-1 forgetting how big states are *T*-2 out there sometimes . E_S

51385:53	\[ And , \+ and \] you 'll be happy I think 0 *T*-2 in October when the Dodgers win *T*-1 . E_S
51425:38	I stayed off work with her for little over of a year when she was born *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
51431:6	And how did you choose that sitter *T*-1 ? E_S
51498:5	What kind of questions *ICH*-1 did you ask *T*-2 about the private sitter before you took her over there ? E_S
51527:20	and we questioned her about what she fed them *T*-4 and , um , what she did *T*-1 with them during the day and , um , you know , just how she treated them *T*-2 , \[ how , \+ how \] her daughter was *T*-3 with the children when her daughter got home from school *T*-5 and , stuff like that . E_S
51527:46	and we questioned her about what she fed them *T*-4 and , um , what she did *T*-1 with them during the day and , um , you know , just how she treated them *T*-2 , \[ how , \+ how \] her daughter was *T*-3 with the children when her daughter got home from school *T*-5 and , stuff like that .

51527:154	and we questioned her about what she fed them *T*-4 and , um , what she did *T*-1 with them during the day and , um , you know , just how she treated them *T*-2 , \[ how , \+ how \] her daughter was *T*-3 with the children when her daughter got home from school *T*-5 and , stuff like that . E_S
51541:17	I , mean , when they see each other *T*-1 , you know , they just love each other to death . E_S
51567:8	So , what *T*-1 made you decide *-2 to put her in a Montessori school ? E_S
51609:54	And , I just kind of let her go , *-2 \[ see , \+ see \] what she felt like * doing *T*-1 . E_S
51630:30	it *EXP*-3 's hard * to tell how much *T*-1 has been that or how much *T*-2 is just her . E_S
51630:52	it *EXP*-3 's hard * to tell how much *T*-1 has been that or how much *T*-2 is just her . E_S
51707:40	I do n't think 0 she checks things out very well . Which , *T*-1 really surprises me . E_S
51728:13	And that 's why I do n't mind *-1 paying more *T*-2 . E_S
51740:69	And that 's one reason 0 I like *-3 working up there a little bit *T*-2 is , because I know what *T*-1 's really going on . E_S
51762:50	but I thought , well , you know , I 'd like *-1 to see what she 's doing *T*-2 , you , know . E_S
51766:114	But now that I 'm there , I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a lot more convenient because there 's so many kids that *T*-1 doddle . You know , when their parents come *T*-2 , E_S

51907:18	and , they talk about how soon they start that *T*-1 E_S
51918:27	Do they teach them in school right now where she 's at *T*-1 about drugs ? E_S
51925:38	But , of course , they still have no concept of , what in the world drugs are *T*-1 , you , know E_S
51934:7	And what * to do *T*-1 when they 're faced *-2 with it *T*-3 . E_S

51987:66	That 's what I 'm thinking *T*-4 what your mom and dad always used *-1 to say *T*-3 , when you have kids of your own *T*-2 , you 'll understand . E_S
52018:24	\[ What *T*-1 's , \+ what *T*-2 's \] your most recent one that you 've seen *T*-3 ? E_S
52055:5	what type of movies do you like *T*-1 ? E_S

52104:4	What *T*-1 was your favorite all time movie ? E_S
52107:13	Do you know which one yours was *T*-1 ? E_S
52114:5	When that first came out *T*-1 , I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that . E_S
52196:23	And , a lot of times , what I wind up *-1 doing *T*-2 is , * picking say an actor or an actress , and seeing like all , N_S
52210:4	what *T*-1 's his first name . E_S
52222:50	It was really kind of interesting because , Arsenio was asking him about , uh , what he thought *T*-1 of , uh , one of the other action guys . E_S
52277:12	and so , when I watch movies like that *T*-1 , it 's like this can not happen . E_S
52305:29	I mean \[ it was , \+ what I liked *T*-1 about it was \] that it was a new subject . E_S
52358:22	It must have , uh , what *T*-1 's his name in it . E_S
52405:8	because when I thought of that *T*-1 , I thought of , N_S
52408:4	what *T*-2 's the one that *T*-1 just , N_S
52428:16	I was really glad when it won all those awards *T*-1 because it really deserved it . E_S
52459:10	and then when it won all those awards *T*-1 , uh , they pushed it back to August , E_S
52493:26	and \[ if , \+ if \] and when he \[ comes , \+ \] gets free again *T*-1 , he will have no compunction but *-2 to \[ complete \[ that , \+ that \] same kind of lifestyle , \+ I mean continue that same kind of lifestyle , \] and perhaps do the same thing again . E_S
52504:62	\[ I don- , \+ I do n't \] think 0 our prison system is n't set *-1 up , where we , um , rehabilitate , or , you know , restore anybody *T*-2 . E_S
52509:33	but , that does n't negate that you do reap what you sow *T*-1 . E_S
52542:11	you know what I 'm saying *T*-1 , E_S
52544:60	So I feel like you know , \[ that 's is , \+ there is \] occasions where \[ there are , \+ they do \] spare lives *T*-1 E_S
52545:39	and , you know , I leave that with the governor , who , *T*-1 of course , is going *-2 to go through every authority because they want *-3 to be be reelected *-4 , E_S
52598:15	but , I know what you 're saying *T*-1 , uh , E_S
52615:40	and so , I guess 0 that 's \[ what , \+ what \] I mean *T*-1 by their character changes
52616:19	and , you know , what I mean *T*-2 , it 's like * looking beyond what they 're doing *T*-3 and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart *T*-1 , what 's the character showing me *T*-4 here . E_S
52616:55	and , you know , what I mean *T*-2 , it 's like * looking beyond what they 're doing *T*-3 and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart *T*-1 , what 's the character showing me *T*-4 here . E_S

52626:13	And that 's where we just have *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] trust the authorities *T*-2 . E_S
52640:70	and * having sat on both , uh , uh , criminal *RNR*-1 and a civil *RNR*-1 , uh , jury , some of what *T*-2 goes through our courts is a total waste of time . E_S
52655:165	I would like *-1 to see \[ \[ some , \+ some \] kind of reform , \+ or some kind of streamlining \] so that , if a person is , um , convicted *-2 , and sentenced *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] death , \[ that \+ that \] automatic appeal which *T*-3 goes in could be more quickly dealt with *-4 . E_S
52690:40	And that 's \[ \[ what , \+ wh- , \] \+ when \] you have lawlessness *T*-1 , E_S
52697:11	I forget what you call it *T*-1 , E_S
52703:26	And , you 'd see the same kid who *T*-1 were back out there in two days . E_S
52708:22	and I think 0 initially , when our country was set *-1 up *T*-2 , it was set *-3 up with God E_S
52719:30	\[ you know , \+ you know \] what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
52723:61	I feel like that might be better , if it was run *-1 on a more scriptural basis , which *T*-2 would include , you know , you know , and * expediting the penalties and just getting it over with . E_S
52725:28	However , certain uh , very liberal minded groups who *T*-1 do not , um , subscribe to the same ethical system that you and I do *T*-2 , such as the , uh , civil liberties unions and so forth , will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath .

52751:13	and that 's why , you know , I 'm like , okay , what 's my role in this thing *T*-1 , , you know , what 's my part *T*-2 *T*-3 , E_S

52890:42	Oh , well , actually , \[ I would , \+ you know what I would \] love *T*-1 ? E_S
52896:48	but , now \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that 's \] what I would like , *-1 to have *T*-2 . E_S

52924:11	That 's what I would do *T*-1 . E_S
52932:52	I 'm just sitting here \[ list- , \+ listening \] to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going *-1 to have *T*-2 with that . E_S
52941:23	But you know , you know what *T*-1 's really funny ? E_S
52987:4	how was , N_S
53002:93	That 's one thing 0 my husband wanted *-1 to do *T*-2 , \[ was , \+ on this summer 's vacation was \] * to go and camp wherever we went *T*-3 . E_S
53047:15	You know , where you should try *T*-1 , sometime is Colorado . E_S
53072:11	That 's what my girlfriend says *T*-1 . E_S
53092:22	um , I ca n't remember what type of trees they are *T*-1 , E_S
53230:74	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] left T I in January *-1 hoping *-2 to strike out and find a job where I could make some money *T*-3 . E_S

53304:4	How many have you made *T*-1 so far , calls ? E_S
53313:5	How many have you had *T*-1 so far ,
53329:14	it 's like what are you interested in *T*-1 , E_S
53348:27	I always try *-1 to find out where they 're from *T*-2 , you know , E_S
53369:5	when you go next time *T*-1 , * think of me . E_S
53408:43	you know , I 'll look over my husband 's shoulder and see what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
53424:4	Which *T*-1 is n't , you know , pretty much what we \[ loo- , \+ look \] for *T*-2 anyway . E_S

53429:4	what do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S
53446:53	And sometimes I think 0 it *EXP*-4 too much * trying *-1 to figure out who *T*-2 's going *-3 to get the best headlines . And that they 'll run a topic into the ground . E_S
53450:51	And , uh . You know , they try *-1 to play public 's opinion . Which I think 0 *T*-2 is awful , because it usually works . E_S
53460:35	so , it *EXP*-1 will be interesting * to see what *T*-2 happens . E_S
53464:22	* Trying *-1 to think what else *T*-2 \[ is , \+ . is \] current . E_S
53473:26	Well , um , I do n't know what *-1 to say *T*-2 . E_S
53506:38	I mean , it would n't have been as painful as what we would 've paid *T*-1 in state income tax . E_S
53518:31	It *EXP*-1 'll be interesting * to see what *T*-2 happens . E_S
53520:22	* Trying *-1 to think what else *T*-2 is current . E_S
53526:49	Well , the other thing 0 I can think of *T*-1 is , uh , what *T*-2 is still going on in Iraq and the Kurd refugees . E_S
53534:25	and , uh , I do n't know what I 've would have done *T*-1 in the situation . E_S
53540:28	it begins *-1 to make you wonder why we did n't go ahead and go on in and , finish the job while we were in there *T*-2 . E_S
53546:13	But I understand why Bush , you know , does n't want *-1 to go in \[ and , \+ and \] uh , take sides *T*-2 . E_S
53565:39	\[ we , \+ so we \] kept very much abreast of what *T*-2 was going on . E_S
53568:47	\[ \[ Were , \+ were \] they \+ in any of the areas where they , \] some of the Scuds ? E_S
53643:26	It was between six and eight inches here where we are *T*-1 . E_S
53684:93	The public school systems , well everybody 's \[ kno- , \+ has known \] 0 they 've needed renovation for years , but never really had a clear direction on which way *-1 to go *T*-2 with it . E_S
53707:44	they do get bored , uh , really fast , if they already know what you 're talking about *T*-1 . E_S
53708:4	What do you propose that they do *T*-1 ? E_S
53709:16	\[ What , \+ what \] is your suggestions *T*-1 ? E_S
53731:6	But why * not hit the points 0 the kid 's really interested in *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
53762:15	And I think , why do they make us take this stuff *T*-1 ? E_S
53763:14	I mean , what does this have *-1 to do *T*-2 with * getting , you know , a computer science degree or whatever , you know ? E_S
53765:17	\[ What , \+ what \] type of history class is it *T*-1 that you 're having *-2 to take *T*-3 ? E_S
53780:38	\[ That 's , \+ well that 's , \] basically what they 're doing *T*-1 . E_S
53810:16	I do n't know where you 're from *T*-1 , E_S
53815:44	Well , parents were getting really angry about this , because they said , Why is my child being put *-1 in this closet *T*-2 . E_S
53816:9	Well , how is that helping my child , you know *T*-1 . E_S
53824:43	\[ If , \+ if \] the isolation concept really works that good , why are our prisons overcrowded *T*-1 ? E_S
53837:47	I said , \[ now what good does thi- , \+ I mean , how is this helping *T*-1 ? \] E_S
53842:5	When I was \[ br- , \+ brought \] up *T*-1 , if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough , you were going *-2 to get spanked *-3 . E_S
53867:30	* Let 's put him into a situation where , okay , you crossed the line *T*-3 ,
53884:77	\[ the , \+ the \] kid 's having *-1 to give up his , quote , play time *-2 to pay his debt for what he did *T*-3 wrong . E_S
53893:71	for instance , one of the things 0 they do *T*-1 at , uh , my kids school , uh , they have what they call *T*-2 , uh , * caught *-3 being good slips . E_S
53894:7	And when the kids are in halls and stuff *T*-1 , and if they 're being really good , I mean , just being excellent , they 're not , you know , cutting up and so on .

E_S They 're just standing in line , doing whatever they are supposed *-2 to *?* *T*-3 , E_S they get one of these * caught *-4 being good slips . E_S
53895:12	And then , when they collect them at the end of each week *T*-1 , they get *-2 to go to this little , what they call *T*-3 their * caught *-4 being good store , E_S
53895:75	And then , when they collect them at the end of each week *T*-1 , they get *-2 to go to this little , what they call *T*-3 their * caught *-4 being good store , E_S
53909:34	, I mean , my kids definitely get spanked *-1 when \[ they need \+ they need \] *-2 to be spanked *-3 *T*-4 . E_S
53913:28	but \[ they , \+ they \] do when they deserve it *T*-1 , you know . E_S
53934:75	Well , there 's so many parents that *T*-1 say , 0 you can deal with a child without *-2 spanking them . Which *T*-3 is true ,
53936:17	But there are times when a child needs *-1 to be spanked *-2 *T*-3 . E_S
53939:21	* Need that shock effect , where they equate the shock of *-2 being spanked *-1 with the actions 0 they did *T*-3 to get spanked *-4 *T*-5 . E_S
53948:4	Who *T*-1 has spare time ? E_S
53986:21	Well , well , that 's what I meant *T*-1 by salt that \[ we , \+ we \] did that like as a family , little ornaments and , things like that , and just kind of really got into it . Like during the Christmas season , *-2 making them up for other people and things like that . E_S
54025:8	Just when I get some spare time here and there *T*-1 I 'll work on it , E_S
54036:19	I do n't even know how * to knit *T*-1 E_S

54094:97	\[ but , \+ and , \] I mean , I 'm sure 0 it *EXP*-1 must be relaxing * to do things like that E_S because I can remember when I used *-1 to do , you know , \[ those little salt , \+ those figurines \] and things *T*-2 . E_S
54138:21	Um , I do n't know what we 're going *-1 to do *T*-2 about it , E_S

54148:9	Uh , what do you want *-1 to concentrate on *T*-2 . E_S
54168:7	Well how did they feel about \[ the , \+ uh , the \] United States \[ interven- , \+ intervening \] with Patriot missiles *T*-1 , E_S
54180:14	But , um , when they were living in Israel *T*-1 , \[ it was , \+ it was , \]

54370:33	it 's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict *T*-1 E_S

55224:74	And my reasons are based *-1 upon not only \[ from \+ \] \[ what I read *T*-2 in the newspapers , \+ what I see *T*-3 on the newspapers , \] but up against some of the , fun and exciting things 0 I ran into *T*-4 during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group . E_S
55230:16	Well , that 's what *T*-1 makes it a powder keg . E_S
55232:42	I 'll go back in time a little bit , to about eighty-one , when my first real involvement with the military started *T*-1 . E_S
55262:68	They have a university in Moscow called * the Patrice de Lamumba University . E_S About like A and M or U T , where they 're teachings subjects like that *T*-1 ,
55272:22	\[ When they , \+ when they \] graduate from there *T*-1 , they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world . E_S
55273:25	And they are very , very good at what they do *T*-1 . E_S
55278:27	Their military is different from ours , to where there are extremist \[ gen- , \+ generals \] that *T*-1 actually control tens and thousands of troops . E_S That N_S irregardless of what Soviet policy is *T*-2 , *T*-3 they 're going *-4 to do what the general tells them *T*-5 *T*-6 . E_S
55278:103	Their military is different from ours , to where there are extremist \[ gen- , \+ generals \] that *T*-1 actually control tens and thousands of troops . E_S That N_S irregardless of what Soviet policy is *T*-2 , *T*-3 they 're going *-4 to do what the general tells them *T*-5 *T*-6 . E_S
55278:144	Their military is different from ours , to where there are extremist \[ gen- , \+ generals \] that *T*-1 actually control tens and thousands of troops . E_S That N_S irregardless of what Soviet policy is *T*-2 , *T*-3 they 're going *-4 to do what the general tells them *T*-5 *T*-6 . E_S
55281:22	I guess 0 that 's what *T*-1 concerns me the most . Is 0 \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] so unstable that somebody like that could make , uh , decisions that *T*-2 would jeopardize a lot of people . E_S
55289:25	There 's probably five or six , which *T*-1 would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs , that *T*-2 are in positions over some of these Soviet states . E_S
55335:29	Did n't it *ICH*-1 bug you a little bit why they kept *-2 coming up with all this stuff *T*-3 ? E_S
55343:58	\[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] a little bit shocked to what the U S has done *T*-1 in terms of *-2 selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years . E_S
55359:60	It *EXP*-1 's scary * to know that they 're supplying that many people with weapons . Especially when it 's to the south of us *T*-2 . E_S
55373:15	and the governments , which our government has technically supported *T*-1 for years , are corrupt as all get out . E_S
55381:38	Well , I think 0 Russia is getting to the point where \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] about *-1 to do something *-2 to get out of communism *T*-3 . E_S
55412:28	It may be a much reduced force than what we used *-1 to have *T*-2 over there . E_S
55416:60	It 's got *-1 to have the stuff *-2 to \[ back it , \+ back up \] what it 's saying *T*-3 . E_S
55426:7	And when I can *?* *T*-1 , I like *-2 to ride my regular bike outside , because it 's so much nicer . E_S
55438:4	Whatever I can do *T*-1 *-2 to keep myself occupied . E_S
55442:65	\[ really , \+ that 's really \] the only time 0 I ever watch T V *T*-1 , is when I 'm on the bike *T*-2 . E_S
55444:63	and that just kind of \[ gets myself , \+ uh , gets me , \] you know , to where I 'm not quite as tired *T*-1 I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
55459:18	And I have n't figured how *-1 to get that soft *T*-2 , E_S
55476:26	See , I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 's my biggest problem with * going to \[ a place , \+ uh , \[ a , \+ a \] health club . \] E_S
55494:35	but I do n't have *-1 to be conscious of what I 'm doing *T*-2 or how I 'm doing it *T*-3 . E_S
55494:54	but I do n't have *-1 to be conscious of what I 'm doing *T*-2 or how I 'm doing it *T*-3 . E_S
55499:24	Because , hey , you can do what you want *T*-1 . E_S
55501:37	and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing *T*-1 . E_S
55518:6	or what is , N_S
55526:34	They call it aqua exercise , I guess is what they call it *T*-1 . E_S
55546:4	When you 're in the water *T*-1 ? E_S
55588:8	So , how often do * find yourself going *T*-1 ? E_S
55589:55	Um , \[ on a , \+ if you 're doing it on a \] regular basis , how often do you go *T*-1 ? E_S
55602:48	But I do force myself to do it at least three times a week . Which I do n't feel like *T*-1 is enough , E_S
55613:5	When I was working up at , uh , The Summit , here in Plano *T*-1 , I 'd leave there , E_S
55626:14	Because no matter what I did *T*-1 or how I did it *T*-2 , I invariably got myself wet . E_S
55626:30	Because no matter what I did *T*-1 or how I did it *T*-2 , I invariably got myself wet . E_S
55634:28	So I mean , it 's your choice where you want *-2 to go *T*-3 , E_S
55644:32	Uh , did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I *T*-1 ? E_S
55650:18	so I 'm very limited what I do *T*-1 . E_S
55659:7	Especially when you 're on cement or anything that *T*-1 's hard *T*-2 , E_S
55669:22	Well , \[ that , \+ what *T*-1 pushed me that \] way though , \[ was \+ basically was \] the fact that when I went in there *T*-2 , is was n't for the water aerobics . E_S
55669:77	Well , \[ that , \+ what *T*-1 pushed me that \] way though , \[ was \+ basically was \] the fact that when I went in there *T*-2 , is was n't for the water aerobics . E_S
55698:55	I dropped , oh , I 'd say *RNR*-1 almost twenty pounds . Just by *-2 watching what I ate *T*-3 . E_S
55702:30	And they fix you up with a diet , which *T*-1 worked real good . E_S
55711:16	I mean , when you go in there *T*-1 , they would n't make you do theirs . Would they *?* ? E_S
55718:34	* See \[ I joined , \+ uh , when this one down here opened up *T*-1 , I joined \] as a V I P . E_S
55721:55	and they show you \[ how , \+ everything 0 * to do *T*-1 , and how \] * to do it *T*-3 , and the whole nine yards . E_S
55726:17	But they have packages where they just offer the exercise program *T*-1 . E_S
55727:10	Is that what you 're saying *T*-1 ? E_S
55736:39	so \[ it was , \+ it 's \] less than what you pay *T*-2 now for *-1 going in there , after all this time . E_S
55740:17	So it 's like when I got laid off *-1 *T*-2 , E_S I went back in there , and start all over again because it had been a while since I 'd done it . E_S
55766:46	But that 's because of my physical condition and nothing 0 *T*-1 to do what they did *T*-2 . E_S
55775:12	But usually , when I go into the hot tub *T*-1 before I go *-2 swimming , or when I come out *T*-3 , I 'm totally relaxed when I go home *T*-4 . E_S
55775:58	But usually , when I go into the hot tub *T*-1 before I go *-2 swimming , or when I come out *T*-3 , I 'm totally relaxed when I go home *T*-4 . E_S
55775:88	But usually , when I go into the hot tub *T*-1 before I go *-2 swimming , or when I come out *T*-3 , I 'm totally relaxed when I go home *T*-4 . E_S
55783:33	And they 've got , uh , the stepping bike , where you step *T*-1 . E_S
55787:29	And I 've enjoyed that , *-1 watching how well I can walk up and down stairs *T*-2 . E_S
55790:52	\[ I wanted , \+ I wanted \] *-1 to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike *T*-2 , E_S
55800:4	Which one do you feel 0 *T*-1 is better , since you use them both ? E_S
55804:68	Like you said , you can sit and do it , and watch the T V and not even really be conscious of what you are doing *T*-1 . E_S
55808:27	With the stepper , you are conscious of what you are doing *T*-1 because you 're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down . E_S
55813:36	you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so , to what your gear is *T*-1 . E_S
55818:17	it would depend upon which one you want *T*-1 . E_S
55821:35	Because you can buy a month 's membership . And see what you feel 0 *T*-1 is best for you . E_S
55828:41	Because it all depends , you know , for everyone their own what they want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
55835:41	so I can sit there and read and listen to music , like what you said *T*-1 , E_S
55847:9	Uh , who *T*-1 wants *-2 to start this one ? E_S
55854:56	Well , you know , \[ I 'm \+ like , I 'm \] not really sure what I think *T*-1 about this . E_S
55874:19	I do n't know \] how old you are *T*-1 , E_S
55875:7	but when I was , uh , in high school *T*-1 , it was the beginning of Vietnam and so forth . E_S
55881:176	But \[ I , \+ I \] felt strongly then that even if they did n't feel like they could kill someone , or go into a military situation , that they could help the country in other ways . Be it * cleaning out , uh , lots , \[ in , \+ in \] their neighborhood or , whatever kind of community or public service *T*-2 might be available . E_S
55891:79	since we live here and we all *ICH*-2 benefit , rich , poor or in between , uh , there are benefits even for those who *T*-1 have it the hardest .
55906:175	Things that *T*-1 need *-2 to be done *-3 , \[ that *T*-4 wou- , \+ that *T*-5 could \] be done *-6 in an hour or two , uh , a day , or several hours of the week . Like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that . In addition to what one does *T*-7 , uh , besides that . E_S
55916:34	\[ I , \+ I \] ca n't , imagine what kind of , uh , uh , bureaucracies *ICH*-2 we 'd get into *T*-1 and expense *-3 having it be full time , E_S
55952:75	You take pride in that , \[ and , \+ and \] get \[ some , \+ some \] positive feedback from those *ICH*-2 who *T*-1 benefit , besides yourself . E_S
55956:87	And \[ I , \+ I \] see it being most beneficial if it 's in \[ the neighborhood where \+ or , or at least the area where \] the person lives *T*-1 . E_S
55972:154	But as far as * putting that into work , \[ I do n't want *-1 to , \+ I do n't want *-2 to \] deal \[ with the , \+ with the \] heartache of , first of all , * getting it started *-3 and figuring out how *-4 to do the logistics , of it *T*-5 . E_S
56007:5	when I was teaching school *T*-1 I saw \[ many , \+ so many \] kids that *T*-2 were at loose ends and that *T*-3 did n't really have a purpose . E_S
56059:28	and I thought 0 I had seen , when we were traveling around the state *T*-1 , some similar signs *ICH*-2 up that *T*-3 indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up *-4 E_S
56100:28	and even if it 's not environmentally safe , who *T*-1 cares , you know . E_S
56109:8	Especially when we have dwindling , uh , resources such as oil that *T*-1 's burning out of control in the Persian Gulf , \[ and , \+ and \] so forth *T*-2 . E_S
56120:62	Of course , that 's probably blasphemy 0 for you to say *T*-3 , uh , *-2 coming from where you are *T*-1 in Texas . E_S
56125:4	what was it *T*-1 , seventy-four when we had \[ the , \+ the \] \[ last \+ last \] oil crisis *T*-2 ? E_S
56125:23	what was it *T*-1 , seventy-four when we had \[ the , \+ the \] \[ last \+ last \] oil crisis *T*-2 ? E_S
56148:56	so um , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] wonder sometimes if he knows what he 's doing *T*-1 . E_S
56155:13	But that 's why they *ICH*-2 're there *T*-1 and not me . E_S
56173:32	Well , I 'm going *-1 to tell you what I 'd have *T*-2 . E_S
56196:8	And what *ICH*-2 *T*-1 's really neat about it is , the shrimp is cooked *-3 in \[ \[ your , \+ uh , like your \] rice steamer , \+ your rice cooker . \] E_S
56229:7	And how much shrimp would you use *T*-1 ? E_S
56272:7	And what you do *T*-1 is , you just , uh , wash it , E_S
56309:22	\[ Y- , \+ Uh , when you \] core it *T*-1 , you be real careful so you wo n't knock your flowers off . E_S
56345:56	I mean , \[ what you can do *T*-1 then , see is , \+ like what I usually do *T*-2 is , \] I 'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle , E_S
56387:10	Now , how many could you serve *T*-1 ? E_S
56412:158	And , uh , they 're big on finger food *ICH*-2 here , too . You know , chicken wings and , uh , ribs , and that kind of stuff . Uh , barbecue and , uh , * cooking out in the yard , \[ it , ya- , \+ \] you know , when it 's nice *T*-1 . Barbecue outside , chicken and that kind of stuff . E_S
56437:36	and more and more people are beginning *-1 to find out how good it is *T*-2 . E_S
56480:56	Um , \[ * let me think of , \+ I ca n't even think of \] what you , N_S
56506:20	\[ And , \+ and \] where did you say 0 you were from *T*-1 ? E_S
56531:7	Now how do they do the blackened *T*-1 ? E_S
56586:34	Because , \[ it 's called , \+ uh , what it 's called *-2 *T*-3 \] is , Blackening Magic . E_S
56603:10	Is that what you 're saying *T*-1 ? E_S
56618:82	But \[ you do have *-1 to have it , \+ you know , you do have *-2 to have it *ICH*-4 \] hot when you cook it *T*-3 . I mean , your pan . E_S
56625:41	It does have *-1 to be really hot , you know , when you put it in *T*-2 . E_S
56627:39	and \[ it , \+ \] \[ what it , \+ what *T*-1 blackens it , \] is the seasoning . E_S
56654:11	That 's why I enjoy *-1 going to restaurants and \[ have , \+ you know , trying \] different things *T*-2 . E_S
56684:21	Now , \[ wher- , \+ where \] do you go when you go there *T*-2 *T*-1 ?
56684:37	Now , \[ wher- , \+ where \] do you go when you go there *T*-2 *T*-1 ?
56709:16	Of course now , when you go down there *T*-1 , you know , I mean , they 've got just , N_S
56723:24	I 'm trying *-1 to think what they call *T*-2 their soup . E_S
56767:40	and I 've never actually had too many people explain to me why it 's a problem *T*-1 , though I have the same instinctual feeling that it 's a problem E_S
56774:18	and , it those who *T*-1 do n't vote would have voted exactly the same way , you know , in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other , just like everyone who *T*-4 did vote , it *EXP*-5 's not clear to me that it is really a problem , um . E_S
56774:124	and , it those who *T*-1 do n't vote would have voted exactly the same way , you know , in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other , just like everyone who *T*-4 did vote , it *EXP*-5 's not clear to me that it is really a problem , um . E_S
56782:42	I mean if you look at the break down of those who *T*-1 do n't vote , they tend *-2 to be , you know , N_S
56806:57	The first really \[ popular , \+ you know wide spread \] one was , uh , Proposition Thirteen which *T*-1 was a , uh , tax revolt , against property taxes . E_S
56815:18	there were apparently voters who *T*-1 just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were \[ asked , \+ being asked *-2 *-3 \] to make decisions on topics that *T*-4 would have three different competing proposals E_S
56823:59	you know , \[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's , \] \+ that 's \] why we hire people \[ who , \+ \] uh , you know , 0 *T*-1 \[ to , \+ to \] make these decisions for us *T*-2 . E_S
56843:9	Anyone who *T*-1 does n't vote , it 's fine with me as long as I can have their vote . E_S
56865:16	I do n't know how I feel *T*-1 about that . E_S
56869:7	Not what I 'd consider *T*-1 truly democratic . E_S
56891:35	and it *EXP*-3 's a duty * to vote on how those taxes are spent *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
56899:70	\[ \[ \[ I , \+ it 's , \] \+ that 's , \] \+ it 's \] complex question when you start *-2 thinking about it *T*-1 , is n't it *?* . E_S
56909:52	I do n't know if they actually are fined *-1 \[ or , \+ or \] what *T*-2 happens , E_S
56926:11	that 's how I feel *T*-1 . E_S
56929:127	but if you do n't vote , \[ I sort of feel like , \+ part of me , and it 's kind of a nasty part of me feels like , \] well if you did n't vote , you get what *T*-1 's coming to you , you know . E_S
56937:22	\[ When they \+ especially when \[ someone , \+ \[ they , \+ , they \] \] \] do n't vote for someone because they do n't like any of them and then the person gets in and they do n't like him and he turns out *-1 to have been worse than her that they might have voted for *T*-2 , or something like that *T*-3 . E_S
56960:79	\[ and , \+ and \] \[ perha- , \+ perhaps \] I 'll call you back and let you know \[ what , \+ how \] the Australian system works *T*-1 . E_S
56985:74	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] really \[ quite , \+ quite \] curious , how that would work *T*-1 , * to have both , I mean , you know , E_S
56988:40	In fact , it *EXP*-2 was even pretty much spelled *-1 out who you did vote for *T*-3 , up until fairly recently E_S
56989:15	and , that 's what I think of *T*-1 when I think of 0 you 're obliged *-2 to vote *T*-3 . E_S
56989:32	and , that 's what I think of *T*-1 when I think of 0 you 're obliged *-2 to vote *T*-3 . E_S
57008:29	or certain privileges *ICH*-1 come from * voting which *T*-2 are n't that important but are nice 0 * to have *T*-3 , E_S
57028:24	But actually it 's a privilege , which *T*-1 is allowed *-2 to be revoked *-3 . E_S
57055:209	But \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I \] also , \+ I also , \] \+ I \] do n't know if you 've , uh , read any of \[ \[ the , \+ \[ \+ \] um , oh , what do they call those *T*-1 .

57061:49	Um , oh , \[ Hamilt- , \+ I think 0 it was Hamilton \] who *T*-1 wrote number ten or something , where he was arguing for a republican *RNR*-5 , not in the sense of the Republican party now , versus a democratic *RNR*-5 , uh , government and , arguing successfully , why , the United States should be a republic , not a democracy . Which indeed it really is *T*-2 *T*-4 *T*-3 ,

57066:4	Where he defines \[ dep- , \+ democracy \] as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who *T*-1 vote for someone who *T*-2 then in turn votes for the issues *T*-3 . E_S
57066:66	Where he defines \[ dep- , \+ democracy \] as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who *T*-1 vote for someone who *T*-2 then in turn votes for the issues *T*-3 . E_S
57066:84	Where he defines \[ dep- , \+ democracy \] as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who *T*-1 vote for someone who *T*-2 then in turn votes for the issues *T*-3 . E_S
57071:35	And the whole idea was , um , 0 presumably those who *T*-1 get voted *-2 in would be wiser than the average person , \[ and , \+ and , \] a specialist and able *-3 to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy , E_S
57078:45	And , uh , he makes a very , uh , passionate , good argument for why you do n't want some things decided *-1 by democratic process *T*-2 , E_S
57080:17	and there are cases when you do n't want that to be the case *T*-1 .
57087:56	\[ and , \+ and \] actually I agree , except that I do n't trust the people who *T*-1 are appointed *-2 to vote . E_S
57099:43	And there 's also an antigovernment mood in the country , you know , where government is misspending your dollars *T*-1 E_S
57106:99	And , there 's a notion that somehow , if someone is n't as much as a government person , they 're less corrupt and they 're more likely *-1 to be good which *T*-2 is really strange , E_S
57111:47	I was just trying *-1 to think about \[ how I , \+ how I \] dress for work *T*-2 , you know , E_S
57116:14	And , uh , what I usually do *T*-1 on the weekend \[ is , \+ is \] * lay out five outfits E_S
57126:15	Uh , but mostly what I wear *T*-1 are skirts and blouses or , you know , skirts and , uh , pullover sweaters or , uh , you know , little two piece dress \[ suit , \+ suits \] like , E_S
57142:19	so I can just wear whatever I have *T*-1 on for school , E_S
57156:8	Like where I work *T*-1 , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] pretty casual , uh , E_S
57163:20	and they dress up like when customers are coming in *T*-1 , or , uh , when we have department meetings or something like that *T*-2 . E_S
57163:51	and they dress up like when customers are coming in *T*-1 , or , uh , when we have department meetings or something like that *T*-2 . E_S

57283:34	See \[ that 's how , \+ that 's how \] I am *T*-1 E_S
57301:32	Uh , \[ whe- , \+ you know , when \] they were coming up *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] did n't sew , E_S
57302:38	but now \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] learned how *-1 to sew *T*-2 , E_S
57303:60	so \[ \[ I 'm , \+ well I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] still learning how , E_S
57391:39	\[ there 's , \+ there 's \] always a reason why they 're on sale *T*-1 . E_S
57420:50	and after I wore it a couple of times I realized \[ why , \+ why \] \[ it was , \+ it was \] so cheap *T*-1 . E_S
57435:13	And that 's why it was so cheap *T*-1 , although , \[ it 's not , \+ it 's not \] really noticeable , uh , from the outside , E_S
57462:16	I do n't know what \[ the , \+
57470:25	but I 've gotten to the point where , uh , the newer cars are getting so complicated 0 * to work on *T*-1 that , uh , oh , most of the cars N_S
57474:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
57493:18	and a woman asked me what that meant *T*-1 E_S
57544:27	I was hoping 0 I could remember where all those other things went *T*-1 . E_S
57547:40	I tried *-1 to remember *ICH*-3 as I took stuff off where it went *T*-2 , E_S
57548:50	and I do n't think 0 I had too many nuts and bolts left * over when I got it all put *-1 back together *T*-2 . E_S
57554:23	And , uh , I bought it when we were living in Lubbock *T*-1 , E_S
57555:5	when I came back here *T*-1 , I brought the car back here E_S
57559:21	I mean , though for what you could get *T*-1 for one , you might as well drive it over a cliff . E_S
57570:29	I do n't think 0 I 'd know where * to start *T*-1 with a diesel . E_S
57580:114	I think 0 the \[ onl- , \+ closest \] thing 0 I 've come *T*-2 \[ to , \+ to \] a diesel is , 0 I 've worked for a tractor repair shop , uh , when I was in high school *T*-1 E_S
57588:62	Well the injector nozzle and stuff in , you know , the big diesel farm tractors , you know , what *T*-1 are about the size of your thumb , E_S and the- , N_S
57612:54	\[ I , \+ I 'm \] beginning *-1 to wonder \[ is , \+ \] where do you get gas at *T*-2 . E_S
57631:30	But it turns out 0 a pickup was n't what I really needed *T*-1 , E_S
57646:11	that 's what I like *T*-1 because , they 've got plenty of power , E_S
57651:31	I 'm convinced that , uh , Detroit or whoever it is *T*-1 made a major mistake , years ago when they stopped *-2 putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes *T*-3 . E_S
57651:63	I 'm convinced that , uh , Detroit or whoever it is *T*-1 made a major mistake , years ago when they stopped *-2 putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes *T*-3 . E_S
57669:43	I think 0 \[ that little , \+ the little \] Chevy V eight when it started out \[ in sixty , \+ in fifty-five , \] I think *T*-1 was two sixty-five , something like that . N_S
57674:39	But , uh , they kept *-1 boring that block out to where you could a get a \[ four hundred , \+ small block four hundred \] that *T*-2 was , uh , the same block *T*-3 , you know , \[ just , \+ just \] kept *-1 boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more , an . N_S
57714:39	Like you say it takes a plumber *-1 to figure out where all this stuff goes *T*-2 . E_S
57727:52	Well if you had *-1 to *?* you could climb up in there and do what you needed *-2 to *?* *T*-3 . E_S
57741:16	And I said well where are the other three *T*-1 . E_S
57757:9	Well when they went to the , N_S started with the newer engines *T*-1 , you know , E_S when they started *-2 putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines *T*-3 is where they started *-4 getting into so much , you know , trouble *T*-5 . Because the three fifty with all the , you know , N_S
57757:61	Well when they went to the , N_S started with the newer engines *T*-1 , you know , E_S when they started *-2 putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines *T*-3 is where they started *-4 getting into so much , you know , trouble *T*-5 .

57797:43	And I had *-1 to get all those off , you know , when I was replace that , uh , water pump *T*-2 . E_S
57801:54	And , uh , I had *-1 to struggle with that for a while *-1 to figure which belt *T*-2 goes where . E_S
57805:15	You know , when one of them breaks *T*-1 , it 's not the outside one , E_S
57820:5	how many times have you done this now *T*-1 ? E_S
57859:93	and so there 's probably a lot of things 0 I remember *T*-1 and a lot of things that I really did n't have a clue as to what *T*-2 was happening *T*-3 . E_S
57871:87	And \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War 0 we just had *T*-1 , where President Bush went out and got worldwide support \[ for , \+ for \] what *T*-2 was happening *T*-3 . E_S
57871:133	And \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War 0 we just had *T*-1 , where President Bush went out and got worldwide support \[ for , \+ for \] what *T*-2 was happening *T*-3 . E_S
57890:28	Do n't you think that maybe that 's why we had it this time *T*-1 ? E_S
57897:5	what it translated into *T*-1 was 0 they were opposed to the folks that *T*-3 were there *-4 fighting it E_S
57935:42	He went over there *-1 to get them out of Kuwait , which he did *T*-2 . E_S
57942:6	so why are n't you helping us *T*-1 ? E_S
57970:33	\[ he , \+ he \] said that 's what we were going there *-3 to do *T*-1 E_S
57971:25	and he did \[ what , \+ what \] he said *T*-1 E_S
57972:53	and he did pull out before it got any further than that \[ where , \+ where \] it would have turned into more of a police action . Uh , or more of a political action I guess , *T*-2 you getting into their governmental affairs which you really ca n't do *T*-1 \[ as , \+ as \] another country . E_S
57972:145	and he did pull out before it got any further than that \[ where , \+ where \] it would have turned into more of a police action . Uh , or more of a political action I guess , *T*-2 you getting into their governmental affairs which you really ca n't do *T*-1 \[ as , \+ as \] another country . E_S
57988:42	\[ And , \+ and \] \[ tha- , \+ that 's \] what *T*-1 frustrates me more than anything . E_S
57999:189	\[ i- , \+ if \] they could just cut out all the fat \[ and , \+ and \] get it lean , and start *-1 addressing some of the other issues , E_S I think 0 *T*-2 we could take care of everything . And quit *-3 taking care of all these other countries all across the world , you know , who *T*-4 just end up *-5 using things against us later on anyway . E_S
58049:67	I mean , \[ \[ it was , \+ they 're , \] \+ they still do n't \] know what they were there for *T*-1 . E_S
58058:6	but what did we do *T*-1 . E_S
58060:20	\[ and , \+ and \] what were we trying *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
58061:4	Who *T*-1 knows . E_S
58068:19	Um , I do remember when it was over *T*-1 . E_S
58069:11	I remember when they were coming home *T*-1 . E_S
58094:5	when this war broke out *T*-1 it frustrated me all \[ thi- , \+ the \] antiwar people and , you know , \[ their , \+ all the \] demonstrations that *T*-2 were going on . E_S
58099:89	because \[ those kind of people , \+ I mean , you know , they 're the kind of people \] \[ who *T*-1 are , \+ who *T*-2 've \] always got *-3 to have a cause , whether it 's good , bad of indifferent . E_S
58126:35	Um , \[ and I , \+ and I \] recall when President Bush said that *T*-1 , you know , E_S
58130:51	but , uh , you 're not helping the people that *T*-1 are over there by what you 're doing *T*-2 . E_S
58146:21	And I do n't even know what they 're doing *T*-1 for themselves . You know . E_S
58168:37	\[ And , \+ and \] I think 0 that 's where we as American people really \[ failed , \+ you know , failed \] them *T*-1 . E_S
58200:24	Well , uh , \[ what \+ what \] do you think *T*-1 about the metric system ? E_S
58217:71	\[ if , \+ if \] somebody \[ ha- , \+ is \] totally unfamiliar with it , uh , human nature being what it is *T*-1 we do n't like *-2 to change . E_S
58230:55	well I 've lived both in the United States \[ and , \+ and \] in a country where they do use the metric system *T*-1 E_S
58239:26	and , I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 hung people up the most is 0 they went now * wait a minute ,
58244:4	how on earth am I every going *-1 to do the math *T*-2 ? E_S
58256:115	And I think 0 the real problem with \[ this , \+ this \] weird conversion , \[ yo- , \+ you \] see signs that *T*-1 say fifty-five miles per hour and , you know , whatever it would be *T*-2 one hundred six kilometers per hour , you know , N_S
58277:16	I do n't know why they \[ we- , \+ um , were \] more able than we were *?* *T*-1 E_S
58323:21	oh , oh , that 's what I was thinking *T*-1 by quick transition , E_S
58397:20	well * get back to what you 're doing *T*-1 E_S
58419:5	When I was single *T*-2 we used *-1 to always cook , around the house . E_S
58457:9	so , when I was home *T*-1 I still cooked a lot E_S
58488:49	I was just going *-1 to say , 0 * makes a difference in what you eat *T*-2 does n't it . E_S
58496:36	We try our hardest *-3 to get them to eat what we , \[ w- , \+ \] eat *T*-2 , you know . E_S
58532:4	What 's that *T*-1 . E_S
58542:20	\[ what 's , \+ what is \] that *T*-1 ,
58551:19	I ca n't even remember what the recipe 's name is *T*-1 anymore , E_S
58592:26	but we 're trying *-1 to decide what can we serve *T*-2 because at this one the hostess was pretty busy *-3 running around trying *-4 to get stuff ready for the table E_S
58645:18	My dad would n't know what * to do *T*-1 . E_S
58666:7	but when I got into the vegetarian cooking *T*-1 we got kind of used to that , E_S
58712:5	when I was home with them *T*-1 , and \[ it , \+ it \] was just so much cooking , E_S
58758:18	and my mother taught me how * to make it *T*-1 . E_S
58776:16	I ca n't remember what it 's called * *T*-1 , E_S
58804:32	But , uh , it 's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad *T*-1 E_S
58815:13	and that 's how they continue the thing *T*-1 . E_S
58821:16	I do n't know how safe that was *T*-1 . E_S
58840:4	Where are you calling from *T*-1 by the way ,
58871:11	that 's where practically everybody 0 I talked to *T*-1 is from *T*-2 . E_S
58876:21	I think 0 that 's why they call me because they want *-1 to get people outside the state *T*-2 , you know . E_S
58882:11	that 's where we went *T*-1 . E_S
58911:56	\[ one of my , \+ one of my \] friends here , he was just talking how he 's thinking of *-1 leaving the company and going to Dallas *T*-2 , E_S
58947:4	what do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S
58968:49	or either they 'll have a computer at home *RNR*-2 and in the hospital *RNR*-2 where you \[ can just , \+ you know , just \] continue right on with your work *T*-1 . E_S
58979:115	\[ And it , \+ and it \] seems , if you 're going *-1 to have kids , uh , that \[ you are , \+ you know , society has \] decided for you how many you can really have *T*-2 and make it . E_S
58989:44	Now , I was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where \[ when my kids were , \+ you know , when I had them *T*-1 and when they were small *T*-2 , \] until \[ they got in junior high school , \+ my youngest got in junior high , \] I did n't have *-3 to work *T*-4 . E_S
58989:82	Now , I was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where \[ when my kids were , \+ you know , when I had them *T*-1 and when they were small *T*-2 , \] until \[ they got in junior high school , \+ my youngest got in junior high , \] I did n't have *-3 to work *T*-4 . E_S

59001:36	\[ Steve 's , \+ Steve has \] a sister who *T*-1 has four . E_S
59004:16	I do n't know how they do it *T*-1 . E_S
59005:35	\[ I don- , \+ I do n't \] know how people do it with one *T*-1 , E_S
59025:17	Well it 's getting where \[ you ca n't hardly afford , \+ if you 're going *-1 to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you ca n't hardly afford \] *-2 to have over two *T*-3 . E_S
59038:40	and if I had a third one , I just do n't know where it would come from *T*-1 . E_S
59048:5	when you put them through college *T*-1 it just takes just about everything 0 you got *T*-2 . E_S
59082:52	and , if I 'd of probably had three or four children , I do n't see how *T*-2 we could have made it , you know , without me working *T*-1 . E_S
59098:39	But I think 0 it 's getting more and more like , when you have one child *T*-1 now , that 's it , you know , E_S
59119:29	Well you know , I ca n't imagine how I did *T*-1 , because now I work all the time , E_S
59124:25	and , um , I ca n't imagine how I stayed home *T*-1 . E_S
59128:29	You know , I think to myself , what did I do *T*-1 . E_S
59129:52	And I think \[ it just , \+ it revolutionized \] \[ an , \+ where \] a woman thinks that a way *T*-1 , you know , just like , N_S
59132:10	And then when everything 's set *-1 up *T*-2 , then you look for somebody that you want *-3 to spend the rest of your life with *T*-4 , E_S
59137:20	\[ where , \+ now when \] I graduated high school *T*-1 , the thing , N_S
59139:37	\[ That 's , you did , \+ that 's what you did *T*-1 . \] Uh . E_S
59150:24	And , uh , that 's like when my mo- , N_S
59151:15	I know 0 when my mother 's age it was always the kids and the family and everything 0 *T*-2 had *-1 to come first E_S
59175:52	we 're the only couple *ICH*-3 in our Sunday School class , except for one other couple , who *T*-1 are in their forties , E_S and they ca n't have children , \[ who \+ \] *T*-2 do n't have children . E_S

59176:18	And they ca n't imagine why we would want *-1 to have children *T*-2 . E_S
59186:4	whenever I was coming up and everything *T*-1 N_S
59197:21	I think 0 that 's what it is *T*-1 , E_S
59200:30	And , everybody thought , oh , my gosh , what *T*-1 is the matter with her , you know . E_S
59218:39	and I wanted *-1 to travel and stuff like that , which we did *T*-2 . E_S
59220:32	but , it 's getting more and more like that where there 's more and more couples *T*-1 E_S
59222:16	I do n't care what anybody tells you *T*-1 . E_S
59228:35	now , she says that , you know , maybe when she 's thirty *T*-1 she might want a child then . E_S
59235:101	Steve 's mom \[ finally , \+ uh , finally \] \[ s- , \+ you know , said \] \[ that , \+ that \] God will take care of us when it 's our time *T*-1 . E_S
59247:5	How we got together *T*-2 , I do n't know *T*-1 , E_S
59254:13	and I saw how life was *T*-2 when she stayed home *T*-1 E_S
59254:27	and I saw how life was *T*-2 when she stayed home *T*-1 E_S
59264:33	I mean , it really does . Accept for what we give *T*-1 to my daughter , *-2 to , you know , put her through college and stuff . E_S
59286:44	And , uh , I got *-1 to stay home with my kids , which I really wanted *-2 to do *T*-3 , E_S
59305:85	I think 0 it would be neat \[ if , \+ if \] they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you *T*-1 . E_S
59308:35	I do n't know if it is *?* up there where you are *T*-1 E_S
59309:7	but where I am *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ \] just like all the hospitals , they 're getting day care . E_S
59336:63	and , uh , I must say that there are a couple of arguments against , uh , strong gun control which I find *T*-1 very compelling , although most the people who *T*-2 argue gun control with me I find , uh , 0 *T*-3 use sort of canned arguments , you know , sort of the N R A slogan arguments E_S
59336:98	and , uh , I must say that there are a couple of arguments against , uh , strong gun control which I find *T*-1 very compelling , although most the people who *T*-2 argue gun control with me I find , uh , 0 *T*-3 use sort of canned arguments , you know , sort of the N R A slogan arguments E_S
59337:36	and , um , uh , see I 've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it *T*-1 .
59361:36	\[ I resp- , \+ I respect \] them and what their capabilities are *T*-1 . E_S
59373:27	this will be border line N R A which I am not a member of *T*-1 . E_S

59412:5	What I do n't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon \[ it 's \+ it \] would n't , N_S
59437:6	So why hav- , N_S
59439:19	because it does n't matter how restrictive your border control points are *T*-1 E_S
59442:6	So why * have any restrictions at all *T*-1 ? E_S
59446:30	* go back to that one to ten scale where one , being , full gun control , ten being none *T*-1 . E_S

59469:61	I mean , I certainly feel that \[ if , \+ if , \] we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm *T*-1 E_S
59470:70	but , uh , I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility * to know how * do , use it safely *T*-2 as someone learns how * to drive *T*-1 , if not more so . E_S

59480:4	what *T*-1 is the argument , E_S
59481:4	how does the argument work \[ if , \+ uh , if \] the bad guys are going *-1 to have guns anyway *T*-2 . E_S

60729:14	Um , well , what do you think 0 *T*-1 is , uh , \[ the pollutants , \+ the main pollutants \] in the air ? E_S

60768:57	but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of \[ the , \+ \] um , what they do *T*-1 , uh , *-2 to , uh , make their dough and \[ st- , \+ \] to , clean out the flour and stuff like that , E_S
60778:48	and some of the people that *T*-1 work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming *T*-2 they , you know , shut down everything E_S and they clean up their act , but on a normal basis \[ that they 're , \+ that they 're \] dumping things , that they 're not supposed *-1 to be dumping *T*-2 , E_S
60799:26	you know , \[ wh- , \+ when \] you consider , you know , 0 it 's probably not radioactive *T*-1 E_S

60826:24	what 's it called *-2 *T*-1 when you do flour *T*-3 , N_S
60830:68	but , I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know \[ what *T*-2 's , \+ \] how they do the flour *T*-1 . E_S
60863:7	but when they pollute into the air *T*-2 \[ and you 've got , \+ you know , and you 've got \] movement through the air *T*-2 , it 's going *-1 to move a lot of that off . E_S
60864:32	So , I do n't see , you know , how they can do some of the te- *T*-1 , N_S
60865:30	unless it just hangs there like in places where it 's a lot of pollution *T*-3 , you know , like in Los Angeles \[ or , \+ or \] the bigger cities where \[ it , \+ it \] tends *-1 to get stuck *-2 there *T*-4 , N_S

60886:20	and I think , well , what if somebody 's dumped something back there in the , and no one knows about it and , you know , it sinked in through the ground and all that , E_S
60892:30	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] where Stillwater is *T*-1 or , sweet , N_S

60915:5	where Stephenville 's at *T*-1 , they 've had a lot of problems because they 've , um , introduced a lot of dairies there , E_S
60925:31	it 's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around *-1 free *T*-2 , E_S
60932:41	and I read in this article , I could n't believe it , where , you know , like , one cow \[ produces , \+ like , a day , produces \] like a hundred or so pounds of manure *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
60940:7	but when you get that much manure *T*-1 it says 0 *T*-2 it becomes a real problem because \[ it 's not , \+ it 's not \] N_S
60941:5	when , you know , you buy cow manure at the store *T*-1 they 've added stuff to it E_S
60947:5	what it 's doing *T*-1 is it 's going through , uh , E_S
60953:11	I forget what that 's called *-2 *T*-1 with , you know , N_S
60989:7	not when you figure , N_S
61011:7	but when they get them in these tiny little areas *T*-1 , you know , \[ and \+ \] they 've got a real big problem , E_S

61142:5	What kind of a dog is he *T*-1 ? E_S
61159:11	That 's why it *EXP*-2 really surprises me , you know , that he has n't come back , because , like I said , he 's never gone away like this before *T*-1 , E_S

61247:11	That 's what *T*-1 are so neat about animals , E_S
61258:17	They do n't care what you look like *T*-1 , or what you act like *T*-2 , E_S

61288:35	you know , he 's just always been right there when he gets out *T*-1 . E_S
61300:7	and when we did n't *T*-1 it was , like , oh , no , . E_S
61317:21	We 've got so many when he was a puppy *T*-1 , E_S
61360:39	You know . I really do , because he knows exactly where he lives *T*-1 , E_S
61386:7	and when he 's not right at the door in the morning *T*-1 I really worry that something 's happened to him , that \[ somebody , \+ he 's \] got in a fight or , you know , somebody 's hit him E_S
61444:40	and \[ they 're very , \+ he 's very \] affectionate when he wants *-1 to be *?* *T*-2 , E_S
61449:7	But when he wants *-1 to be *?* *T*-2 , uh , he 's really affectionate . E_S
61475:34	I mean , you know , they know exactly how * to get that attention *T*-1 , you know , E_S
61500:11	That 's why we could n't understand why he would want *-2 to get out *T*-3 , you know , because he 's had all this room 0 * to run in *T*-1 *T*-4 , E_S
61500:27	That 's why we could n't understand why he would want *-2 to get out *T*-3 , you know , because he 's had all this room 0 * to run in *T*-1 *T*-4 , E_S
61506:9	Well , how did he get out *T*-1 ? E_S
61547:36	You know , it 's like we ca n't understand why he kept *-1 wanting *-1 to get out *T*-2 , you know , E_S
61551:34	They like *-1 to roam and investigate . And see what *T*-2 's going on . E_S

61623:20	we were really into that when we got him *T*-1 * going to the Ranger games , E_S
61670:9	well , who is this *T*-1 , E_S
61671:4	what do you use yours at home for *T*-1 ? E_S
61711:13	in other words when someone built that software packet *T*-1 they had *-2 to use the programming E_S
61712:56	but if they were careful , they could make the use of it totally without * understanding how the computer works *T*-1 . E_S
61717:24	For the average person is *T*-2 exactly what he can use it for *T*-1 . E_S
61746:16	Uh , * remember how they started out *-1 running three , four hundred dollars *T*-2 . E_S
61796:21	Well , \[ what , \+ what \] is \[ a \+ a \] good brand a inexpensive *T*-1 . E_S
61820:118	\[ And you 'll find all these things \+ and you 'll find the monitors \] forty dollars and the card that *T*-1 drives the monitor that *T*-2 goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which *T*-3 is amazing to me . E_S

61868:27	You can only tell that to somebody who *T*-1 understands binary . E_S
61897:22	And of course now that is where a computer is very handy *T*-1 . E_S
61922:55	\[ and \+ and \] it puts me right up-to-date \[ what I 'm , \+ what I have *-1 to do *T*-2 , \] what I have *-3 to ship *T*-4 , what I should be expecting *T*-5 to be returned *-7 . E_S

61962:18	I do n't know how much *ICH*-1 I know *T*-2 about this subject . E_S
62003:7	and when they graduated *T*-2 she went *-1 to , uh , teach in a small town down in south Texas E_S
62004:62	and I know , that like if you have college notes , if you teach in a lower income bracket where they do n't pay as much *T*-1 and they cancel part of your , you know , your college note or whatever . N_S
62009:80	If it 's like , you know , really \[ a , \+ you know , a \] lower paying job , you know , where in a small town you do n't obviously you do n't need as much as far as *-1 \[ to , \+ you know , to \] live *T*-2 . N_S

62100:89	But it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that *T*-4 have everything *ICH*-2 given *-1 to them that they want *T*-3 to see what it 's like *T*-6 if you do n't have all the money and ca n't have what you want *T*-5 when you want it *T*-7 . N_S

62166:19	but I never can remember what it was *T*-1 , E_S
62167:86	uh , \[ but , \+ but \] \[ that they 're , \+ they 're \] being winnowed *-2 because \[ they 're , \+ \] where they are *T*-1 they 're not adapted to their environment essentially . E_S
62198:67	Down here with the Peace Corps we 're talking about all these people that *T*-1 are n't even in our own country when there 's enough people here that I think 0 *T*-2 probably need help and , could be helped *-3 *T*-4 . E_S
62211:108	And maybe rather than * just , require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like , um , during college , you know , * maybe have some kind of course where they 'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work , and help people in that area or people in the United States *T*-2 .

62232:31	I mean , I know 0 that 's what my father-in-law was talking about *T*-2 , you know ,
62233:4	when you give these people money *T*-1 E_S

62280:75	So , we 're a little \[ fa- , \+ you know , farther \] removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing *T*-1 . E_S
62283:14	that 's exactly what I was going *-1 to ask you *T*-2 . E_S
62329:37	and , uh , it *EXP*-1 's hard * to tell what I 'm doing *T*-2 , E_S
62368:11	we explained what we needed *T*-1 E_S
62387:13	or slots is what it 's called *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
62424:41	In some ways it has more *-2 to do with the people who *T*-1 sold it . E_S
62425:19	They probably did n't know what they were talking about *T*-1 . E_S
62434:29	and we struck an agreement with the people E_S who *T*-1 said * change the casing 0 it comes in *T*-2 so that we could put in extra boards . E_S
62459:60	And then second thing , we still ca n't put the boards in , because they have other things blocking where we need *-1 to do it *T*-2 . E_S
62474:68	\[ You kn- , \+ you know , \] 0 it 's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what *T*-1 goes on . E_S

62570:4	What brand is it *T*-1 ? E_S
62575:19	I really do n't know which brand it is *T*-1 . E_S
62579:13	in our case where we knew 0 we were buying a copy *T*-1 N_S
62658:40	\[ I 've had , \+ I 've known \] people who *T*-1 have had Toyotas *ICH*-3 for years that *T*-2 have had almost no repair work 0 * to do *T*-4 on them . E_S

62703:4	what I 'm doing *T*-1 , right . E_S
62705:32	And it 's a shame too because , uh , when you get right down to it *T*-1 most things , \[ there is n't any , \+ \] if you do a good job , nobody can pay you enough . E_S
62711:7	so whatever you 're paid *T*-1 is enough . E_S

62726:37	I think 0 they underestimate \[ how much , \+ how much \] value the satisfaction N_S is *T*-1 .

62752:16	Little value just in whatever you do *T*-1 . E_S

62814:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S

62997:19	I kind of enjoy it when I 'm doing it *T*-1 .
63012:16	like a Friday afternoon when I 'm tired , it 's the end of the week and I just want *-1 to go home *T*-2 .
63019:19	it *EXP*-2 's amazing how much better I feel *T*-1 . E_S

63061:16	I do n't know why I do n't do more *T*-1 , E_S

63131:26	you do n't like *-1 to see how you work *T*-2 . E_S
63176:47	They even have some , uh , \[ aerobic , \+ uh , water aerobics \] when the weather gets nice *T*-1 out in the pool . E_S
63224:48	but , I think 0 the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced *-2 , from what I 've heard *T*-1 . E_S
63241:4	How should they do it *T*-1 ? E_S
63242:4	Why did n't it work last time *T*-1 ? E_S
63244:6	And why did n't it work last time *T*-1 ? . E_S
63259:18	one of them is where you just take whatever *T*-1 's already standard *T*-2 E_S
63259:32	one of them is where you just take whatever *T*-1 's already standard *T*-2 E_S
63284:50	As long as you can still buy a product in the English units , that 's how you 're going *-1 to think of it *T*-2 . E_S
63286:24	I kind of remember 0 back when gas prices started up , you know , pretty dramatically *T*-1 when they started *-3 getting toward a dollar a gallon range *T*-2 , E_S somebody had , uh , E_S
63286:60	I kind of remember 0 back when gas prices started up , you know , pretty dramatically *T*-1 when they started *-3 getting toward a dollar a gallon range *T*-2 , E_S somebody had , uh , E_S
63298:18	And nobody had any idea what a liter was *T*-1 , E_S
63303:5	When we finally out that liters was about a quart *T*-1 , there 's about four liters in a gallon E_S
63304:19	so you can figure out what you 're actually paying *T*-1 for it . E_S
63309:5	when I was growing up *T*-1 , we were talking metric system in school .
63319:100	I would expect people with any kind of buying power \[ over the age , \+ you know , under the age \] of thirty or so , to have some idea what it is *T*-1 , anyway . E_S
63322:41	\[ The , \+ uh , I think 0 maybe there 's where the \] problem came in *T*-1 , you know . E_S
63325:5	when you learn one from the other *T*-1 , you always end up in this conversion thing all the time . E_S
63344:16	I do n't remember what the other one is *T*-1 E_S
63378:29	And then you end up with a decimal , where you start *-1 getting into mils , and that sort of thing *T*-2 . E_S
63385:46	I remember 0 that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was 0 all overseas designs were in microns *T*-1 E_S
63401:25	have you ever lived in a country where they use metric *T*-1 . E_S
63407:60	You know , if you start *-1 talking about miles , they 'd look at you like , what . E_S
63428:29	and temperature is the big thing the Centigrade for which she says Celsius *T*-1 . E_S
63445:173	\[ So , \+ but , \] uh . The big problem is not * having \[ the , \+ uh , the \] resolution \[ between temperature , \+ you know , between a hundred , \] if you 're talking about a hundred degrees or what , thirty , zero , you know thirty four degrees , whatever that is *T*-1 . E_S
63454:24	* Is about twice as much , what it works out to *T*-1 . E_S
63473:18	but I 'm not sure what they do *T*-1 in England now . E_S
63532:43	I thought 0 maybe they would convert to , uh , metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit *T*-1 , because what is it *T*-2 fifty-six or fifty-seven 's \[ a hundred , \+ uh , \[ qua- , \+ \] a hundred \] kilometers , E_S
63572:29	At that time , anyway , that was still when things were , N_S
63580:45	I know 0 the only other place that I was ever at *T*-1 where they really had it mixed *T*-2 \[ was , \+ was \] in Panama , where 's a lot of the road signs and everything are \[ in , \+ in \] miles per hour *T*-3 E_S

63582:23	And you got *-1 to know where you are *T*-2 because anything that *T*-3 was the old canal zone is going *-4 to be miles per hour , E_S
63589:5	What kind of recycling programs do you have *T*-1 in Rowlett ? E_S
63593:100	and they 've got some great big bins there for newspaper , um , plastic , um , I think three bins for glass , white , green , and \[ whatev- , \+ whatever \] other combination there is *T*-1 . E_S
63599:63	\[ They have , \+ uh , they \] start off *-1 putting out great big huge garbage cans . Which we 're supposed *-2 to put all our week 's garbage into *T*-3 it , E_S
63628:75	Well , Rowlett had \[ sent , \+ sent \] out a survey *ICH*-4 , not too long ago , um , in terms in how many people *T*-1 were interested in *-2 having \[ a , \+ a \] pick up , I guess , on the days 0 they do trash *T*-3 or something like that . E_S
63630:29	I do n't know \[ how , \+ how \] soon they 're going *-1 to do it *T*-4 , or how organized it 's going *-2 to be *T*-3 , E_S

63634:5	where you work *T*-1 , do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that ? E_S
63641:35	Well , down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your , you know , pop cans , and things like that *T*-1 ? E_S
63646:17	so , uh , mainly what they serve *T*-1 in there is juice and coffee and tea . E_S
63673:21	and they put them right near where they have the time cards *T*-1 . E_S
63678:26	And they have one in the room where the snack machines are *T*-1 too . E_S
63691:133	\[ I , \+ I \] noticed at the library or someplace this past , uh , month , month and a half ago , 0 they were having a speaker , um , talk about * doing lawn work and , \[ h- , \+ how \] important it *EXP*-1 is *T*-2 * \[ to , \+ to \] cut your lawn without a bag .

63702:73	The only thing 0 I \[ g- , \+ \] thought , um , that I have n't been trying *T*-1 , is when I , you know , go *-2 to take a shower *T*-4 , * to save the water , and to put it on my plants . Which I had never thought about *T*-3 before . E_S

63714:57	* turning off \[ my fountain , \+ I mean my water \] faucet , in the sink when I brush my teeth *T*-1 . E_S
63729:16	I ca n't remember what my score was *T*-1 , E_S
63740:135	\[ I , \+ I \] wonder about some of the \[ prod- , \+ products \] that they do n't take *T*-1 , like some of the plastics and things that they do n't take *T*-2 . Uh , \[ why , \+ why \] they could n't do more recycling with those *T*-3 . E_S
63743:9	and , what I do n't understand *T*-1 is 0 there is recycled paper in there , E_S
63769:100	companies that *T*-1 do at least go into it , E_S I 'd like *-1 to see subsidy by the government or something , or tax-wise or something , heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular *T*-2 . E_S
63778:14	It 's like when he was saying , uh , which one *T*-2 was recyclable , which *T*-1 was reusable *T*-3 , E_S
63778:36	It 's like when he was saying , uh , which one *T*-2 was recyclable , which *T*-1 was reusable *T*-3 , E_S
63778:54	It 's like when he was saying , uh , which one *T*-2 was recyclable , which *T*-1 was reusable *T*-3 , E_S
63793:14	That 's hard when you 're in a grocery store *T*-1 and you 're short anyway *T*-1 . E_S
63811:38	and , they do n't expand \[ or , \+ or \] contract when the weather changes *T*-1 , E_S
63819:4	what is ,
63842:24	I was trying *-1 to remember what it was *T*-2 .
63855:77	I wish 0 they 'd really push this recycling bit , because \[ I never realized , \+ I really did n't realize \] how much stuff I actually throw *T*-1 away . E_S
63858:82	I think 0 that 's just the biggest problem is keeping it \[ in , \+ in \] front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is *T*-1 , and how important it *EXP*-3 is *T*-2 * to do that . E_S

63860:11	You know what I 'd like *-1 to see *T*-2 a little more . N_S
63865:48	but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now , in five years , when they get bigger *T*-1 , it 'll work a little bit more , too . E_S
63910:4	What building are you in *T*-1 ? E_S
63933:27	So \[ how 's the build- , \+ how 's the weather in building \] two *T*-1 ? E_S
63953:6	So what do you think *T*-1 of the Texas weather ? E_S
63957:4	How long have you been here *T*-1 ? E_S
64038:66	I have *-1 to think every year *-4 to try *-5 to remember \[ what it was , \+ what 's it supposed \] *-2 to like *T*-3 this time of year . E_S
64056:36	it *EXP*-3 's hard * to remember twelve months ago what it was like *T*-1 . E_S
64073:5	when it rains *T*-1 , it rains . E_S
64099:20	And I go , gee , how did they form , you know , so perfect like that *T*-1 . E_S
64114:21	Uh , I do n't know how hail is formed *-2 *T*-1 * to tell you the truth . E_S
64131:16	but maybe that 's what *T*-1 rounds it , I do n't know .
64143:17	it 's in Garland where all the bad weather is *T*-1 . E_S
64165:55	But I guess 0 you just tend *-1 to think \[ of , \+ of \] where your house is *T*-2 you know , and nothing else . E_S
64171:19	and close to that , what *T*-1 's called *-2 Duck Creek that *T*-3 runs through part of Garland , that 's the part that *T*-4 always seems *-5 to get hardest hit *-6 when \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] the hard rain *T*-7 . E_S

64293:5	Where *ICH*-2 are you from *T*-1 in California ? E_S
64299:34	I 've lived in San Diego *ICH*-2 for six years when I was \[ a ki- , \+ \] younger *T*-1 , and L A area , E_S

64354:11	I know where that is *T*-1 . E_S
64358:11	I know where MUMBLEx Valley is *T*-1 , E_S
64448:20	Uh , so , Jack , what type of music do you like *T*-1 ? E_S
64467:27	but now I listen to it well , whenever she does *T*-1 . E_S
64491:53	Though \[ I , \+ I \] could n't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says , This is Bach *T*-1 , you know . E_S
64499:35	\[ I just , \+ I just \] know , when I hear it *T*-1 that I like it . E_S
64506:4	what you like *T*-1 . N_S
64510:10	Uh , whatsever *T*-1 's on the radio \[ is , \+ is \] usually okay with me , E_S
64540:4	whenever they say it two or three times *T*-1 . E_S
64547:27	It 's funny , uh , depending on where you live *T*-1 , E_S
64548:77	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] commute back and forth between Baltimore and a rural town called * Salisbury , which *T*-1 is two and a half hours away , E_S
64561:27	because Baltimore will play more , uh , what *T*-1 might be considered *-2 \[ m- , \+ a little bit more \] progressive ? E_S
64582:30	\[ if , \+ you know , like when \] the Doors movie came out *T*-1 , you know , Doors was really on the radio *ICH*-3 there , you know . Where , you know , you 'd hear \[ was- , \+ \] one or two of their more famous songs , maybe top forty in Baltimore *T*-2 , E_S

64616:45	and \[ I did n't , \+ I never really noticed \] the difference when I moved to this area *T*-1 ? E_S
64625:7	But when I went more rural *T*-1 , you know , \[ that , \+ it \] really changed . E_S
64638:53	Uh , in fact \[ they have , \+ they have \] a continuous news station , which *T*-1 is nice if you 're driving and you want *-2 to h- , N_S
64760:9	Jay , where do you live in Texas *T*-1 ? E_S
64768:4	What 's that *T*-1 ,
64821:4	What 's your house like *T*-1 ? E_S
64838:16	Well , that 's what my wife really wanted *T*-1 E_S
64894:4	How big is your place *T*-1 ? E_S
64923:23	So it wo n't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home *T*-1 , E_S
64957:67	And \[ we got , \+ we got \] a pretty good price , uh , \[ for , \+ for \] what we had *T*-1 . E_S
64995:11	I know where that is *T*-1 . E_S
65012:4	What college are you teaching at *T*-1 ? E_S
65020:36	And it 's just about two miles to the west of where I 'm living *T*-1 . E_S
65167:7	But when I find , N_S
65175:5	When I find an author 0 I really like *T*-1 *T*-2 , I try *-3 to read everything 0 they write *T*-4 . Because \[ you , \+ you \] get used to their style and you really enjoy it . E_S
65200:76	And , um , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] know that \[ when I , \+ you know , when I \] get his book *T*-2 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] usually going *-1 to enjoy it . E_S
65230:5	when I read it *T*-2 , I should have realized that because , I mean , it had Foster 's style written *-1 all over it . E_S
65272:36	I mean , \[ th- , \+ that 's \] why I like *-1 to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED * so much *T*-2 E_S
65328:16	Um , that 's when I had the subscription *T*-1 . E_S
65407:24	Well , \[ how , \+ like how \] much is an Oriole game *T*-1 ? E_S
65440:8	Well how much are the box seats there *T*-1 ? E_S
65458:16	And they 're saying how there 's going *-1 to be a lot more parking for the stadium *T*-2 . E_S
65462:55	But I park for free up \[ at , \+ at \] Memorial Stadium because I know where I can do it for free *T*-1 . E_S
65493:81	\[ \[ \[ They , \+ they , \] \+ they decided , \] \+ you know , George Bush , \[ who , \+ who *T*-1 's \] the main owner of the Rangers , decided \] that , uh , they 'd stay in Arlington . E_S
65500:61	So \[ we 're going *-4 to , \+ they 're going *-1 to \] stay there . Which *T*-2 is fine , because Arlington 's got a lot of things 0 * to offer *T*-3 . E_S
65527:30	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] what I 'd always heard *T*-1 , E_S
65537:80	And it 's takes us maybe , uh , \[ we- , \+ well , \] thirty-five to forty minutes *-1 to get there from Plano , which *T*-2 is not too bad at all . E_S
65540:14	That 's about what it takes me *T*-1 *-2 to get to Memorial . E_S
65588:44	and uh , * just loves \[ D- , \+ Dick \] Vitelle , which not many people do *T*-1 . E_S
65637:30	\[ I get in to , \+ even when I do n't like the sport so much *T*-1 , I get interested in \] the history of sports franchises , E_S
65639:28	Anyway , \[ what are your , \+ what are your \] first comments on that subject *T*-1 ? E_S
65644:4	What would you start *-1 cutting *T*-2 f- , E_S
65645:4	what *T*-2 would be the first thing 0 you 'd cut *T*-1 ? E_S
65678:118	Well , see the other way 0 I 'm thinking about *T*-1 is 0 they should be self-supporting , like , uh , the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons . Anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves *T*-2 . E_S
65698:112	I would like *-1 to be a little more into * investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems . And * to come up with something a little better than what we 've got *T*-2 . E_S
65714:11	I know what you are saying *T*-1 . E_S
65720:28	* To go either as an apprentice , which \[ they , \+ they \] do *T*-1 in other countries .
65721:21	Just * doing it , which I think *T*-3 would bring the education back up . You know , N_S
65725:4	why * not an apprentice out to \[ a , \+ a \] company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or , you know , just a technician *T*-1 ? E_S
65726:51	You can learn on the job . \[ Which , \+ of course , again , which \] *T*-1 \[ m- , \+ would mean , \] again , N_S
65757:60	You know , they want somebody *ICH*-3 , you know , \[ when they then , \+ when they \] \[ bring them off , \+ bring them in *T*-1 , \] that *T*-2 they have something , you know , a certain amount 0 * to contribute *T*-4 . E_S
65787:171	but , uh , you know , I think , 0 uh , \[ they , \+ maybe they \] need *-2 to , uh , help *-3 promote that more . Give incentives like , uh , if they do bring somebody on , they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is *T*-1 , you know , for them to train people , you know , stuff like that .
65792:29	I do n't know , you know , what kind of options they 've got *T*-1 . E_S
65794:24	Well , that 's something about what Germany 's supposed *-1 to be doing *T*-2 . Something similar to that right now . E_S
65795:56	And , uh , they have jobs out on , you know , bulletin boards so people know what *T*-1 is open for an apprentices in different fields . E_S
65796:106	But see , that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people . \[ At people , per , \+ at high school level , \] which I would like *-1 to see *T*-2 . Rather than so many kids getting out of school . E_S
65842:4	What would you do *T*-1 ? E_S
65863:74	one of the news stations . I could n't even tell you which one I watched *T*-1 . But they had on there , where \[ the , \+ the \] output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones 0 *T*-2 are exporting *T*-3 . E_S
65867:11	I started when I was in college *T*-1 . E_S
65887:36	I have , uh , two daughters \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 both are in college E_S
65901:32	And \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] how a lot of people get into trouble *T*-1 . E_S
65987:47	I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-2 's \] tempting when you see something *T*-1 * to say , `` Well , I 'll just charge it . '' E_S
66001:30	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] why \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] really started *-1 to try *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] pay off mine and get out of debt *T*-3 .

66016:4	Where are you *T*-1 ? E_S
66035:72	\[ I 've , \+ uh , I have \] worked on a \[ part , \+ part \] time job , uh , where I was a collector . For , uh , uh , a jewelry company *T*-1 . E_S
66047:52	And , uh , there 's just so many people that *T*-1 have bought jewelry , which *T*-2 is really a luxury item E_S
66107:83	That 's something 0 I never thought about *-4 getting , you know , checking with *T*-2 *-3 to see \[ what , \+ what \] your credit report looked like *T*-1 . E_S
66128:11	That 's when it really gets bad *T*-1 . E_S
66157:44	Well , * always watch out for \[ s- , \+ \] anybody who *T*-1 bills you out of Atlanta , Georgia . E_S

66234:15	Oh , well , what *ICH*-2 's there *T*-3 0 * to say *T*-1 ? E_S
66244:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
66257:11	well from what I underst- , N_S
66268:5	what *T*-1 's amazing is 0 some of them have been on death row for a number of years . E_S
66280:30	here it 's , uh , to the point where they were letting prisoners go . Uh , commuting the sentences of those that *T*-1 were \[ in , \+ in \] jail for lesser crimes , in order *-2 to put more people \[ in , \+ into \] the jails *T*-3 . E_S
66296:29	\[ Is n't , \+ is n't \] Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was *T*-1 . E_S

66389:19	you have the occasional person who *T*-1 may have been falsely accused *-2 ,
66395:132	\[ and , \+ and \] also , um , \[ the , \+ the \] thing 0 I do n't like *T*-3 about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it 's not based *-4 on what *T*-2 is true and what *T*-1 is false E_S

66406:74	we can find out what *T*-1 really happened \[ and , \+ and \] base the \[ ver- , \+ sentence \] on what the person did *T*-2 , not on what we 're allowed *-3 to let the jury hear *T*-4 . E_S

66422:14	and , uh , when the guy came out with the bag 0 they thought 0 *T*-2 was money *T*-3 , it turned out *-1 to be a couple \[ cookies , and , \+ uh , you know , jumbo cookies \] E_S
66451:7	So what *T*-1 was the verdict , E_S
66452:4	what *T*-1 was the results there . N_S
66470:66	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , after the trial was over he came home and told us what *T*-1 was going on E_S
66486:15	but I mean when it all came down *T*-1 , they just , within an hour decided the man 's fate . E_S
66494:53	but then you have *-1 to decide , you know , as a member of society what *T*-5 do I want *-2 to do *T*-3 with this guy who *T*-4 did this thing . E_S
66494:91	but then you have *-1 to decide , you know , as a member of society what *T*-5 do I want *-2 to do *T*-3 with this guy who *T*-4 did this thing . E_S
66505:69	well , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it \] went \[ pretty , \+ pretty \] quick from what he said *T*-1 . E_S
66523:29	But we hear so much about the violence and how it *EXP*-1 's not safe * to walk the streets because \[ somebody , \+ \] you know , these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing . E_S
66529:16	you , never know when they 're going *-1 to turn or hurt the next person *T*-2 because it *EXP*-3 does n't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt *-4 or not . E_S
66543:25	kidnapping , um , you know , when they , N_S
66605:18	but I do n't know what I did *T*-1 to my knee . E_S
66670:9	And , when you want *-1 to do it *T*-2 , it 's really , really aggravating . E_S
66692:37	I have got *-1 to be so much more careful with what I do *T*-2 . E_S
66702:36	* Speaking for myself I do n't sleep as well , when I am not exercising *T*-1 , E_S
66769:19	Oh , I know exactly where that is *T*-1 . E_S
66773:11	you know where the little bridge is on North Oak Cliff Boulevard *T*-1 ? E_S
66877:9	Now , why could n't your wife run around the golf course *T*-1 ? E_S
66891:31	Regardless whether it 's north Dallas or whatnot , when she goes over to this fitness center *T*-1 , it 's fenced *-2 in , E_S
66934:5	When I was out *-1 walking *T*-2 , it , was more of a predawn type , E_S
66966:12	Uh , so what do you do *T*-2 *-1 to exercise ? E_S
66976:16	Uh , that 's what I do *T*-1 . E_S
67001:9	uh , what do you ride *T*-1 , uh ,
67006:28	Uh , but sometimes I bike to work which *T*-1 is about , uh , a fifteen mile trip each way . E_S
67009:4	How long does that take you *T*-2 * to get to work ? E_S
67013:20	\[ How d- , \+ how does \] that \[ work , \+ work \] out with , uh , * storing your bike and showering and all that *T*-1 ? E_S
67032:77	Uh , so I 've been doing that less , \[ and , \+ and \] concentrating more on , you know , light biking when I get home on the evening *T*-1 and then , you know , some more on the weekends . E_S
67044:5	what kind of biking do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
67149:16	I 'm not sure why that is *T*-1 . E_S
67183:13	So , uh , how long have you been biking *T*-1 ? E_S
67186:68	Uh , you know , I guess 0 last time 0 I did it *T*-1 before that was college , which *T*-2 was about ten years ago . E_S
67200:27	because \[ it really , \+ from what I understand *T*-1 , it really \] improves your , uh , cholesterol E_S
67204:80	and , you know , \[ it , \+ uh , it \] kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which *T*-1 is , uh , uh , low cardiovascular fitness , and also , uh , you know , the cholesterol . E_S
67240:4	When do you get *-1 to begin with the winters and all that *T*-2 ? E_S
67241:5	What time of the year do you usually embark on your , N_S
67256:72	Uh , I was thinking of *-1 getting rollers for the last winter , you know , because it will help your balance when you 're indoor training *T*-2 . E_S
67287:9	So , what school is it *T*-1 ? E_S
67332:5	what kind of puppy you got *T*-1 ? E_S
67345:30	and , uh , uh , I ca n't understand why anyone would abandon this dog , though *T*-1 . E_S
67364:16	I ca n't imagine what , uh , *T*-1 would have been wrong with this dog , E_S
67390:25	and , uh , \[ he , \+ when he \] was about seven months old *T*-1 got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death 's door E_S
67427:125	And I \[ felt , \+ felt \] probably worse for them \[ than , \+ than \] for me E_S because , oh gosh \[ \[ they , \+ the , \] \+ uh , this \] fellow 's wife who *T*-1 was , uh , watching the dog , \[ pro- , \+ \] \[ she , \+ I think 0 *T*-2 she \] loved that dog more than I did E_S
67438:4	How long has it been *T*-1 since the first one ? E_S
67451:7	and when she died *T*-1 \[ it just , \+ it just \] absolutely destroyed me . E_S
67467:14	and , uh , when that beagle passed away *T*-1 , uh , \[ he did n't want , \+ he was n't going \] *-2 to have another dog , E_S
67508:7	like who *T*-1 knows , you know . E_S
67555:52	well N_S it 's the same guy that *T*-1 was watching , uh , my German Shepherd when he got hit *-2 *T*-3 , E_S
67603:53	but , uh , this dog , Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do *T*-1 now , as he 's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and , uh , actually paddled up against the current and , uh , made it back to the shore and climbed up E_S
67630:54	She 'd just get on the first step and lay down . You know in the summertime when it 's really , really hot *T*-1 . E_S
67676:56	\[ and , \+ uh , an \] part of \[ the , \+ the \] movie is where he 's trying *-1 to clean this dog up *T*-2 E_S
67691:14	well that 's how Cleo , w- , you know , N_S
67707:37	and \[ I don- , \+ I do n't \] know how many times I 've seen it *T*-1 . E_S
67744:11	That 's how I got \[ into , \+ uh , into \] the switchboard project and all that *T*-1 , E_S
67756:27	\[ what 's the , unrequir- , \+ what 's the word \] 0 I 'm looking for *T*-1 *T*-2 , uh ,
67782:4	What 's the , uh , N_S

67800:60	Well , uh , if you , You know , compare the figures , I think 0 that 's where \[ they 're , \+ uh , they 're \] coming from *T*-1 . E_S
67821:18	and I 'm not sure what it is *T*-1 , E_S
67825:10	Well , why * stop at children *T*-1 ? E_S
67826:4	Why * not go to adults , too *T*-1 ? E_S
67832:9	Uh , why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they 've mowed down a class yard full of kids \[ or t- , \+ or tried *-1 to *?* , \] or \[ done their very , \+ you know , given their \] best effort at *-1 doing that *T*-2 . E_S
67847:5	how many times have you heard where , uh , uh , a citizen was wrongfully arrested *-1 , and served time at a penitentiary *T*-2 , uh *T*-3 , E_S
67847:22	how many times have you heard where , uh , uh , a citizen was wrongfully arrested *-1 , and served time at a penitentiary *T*-2 , uh *T*-3 , E_S
67865:13	But I know what you 're , N_S
67879:4	Why should they be \[ sit- , \+ sitting \] in , uh , prison getting their college degree *T*-1 . E_S
67896:19	but we could never say what we would do *T*-1 if we 're not in the circumstance . E_S
67902:41	* \[ to , \+ uh , to \] kill somebody is what it amounts to *T*-2 . E_S
67905:25	but , you know , that 's what they did *T*-1 . E_S
67912:59	Or rather than * have a warped mind it was just the only way 0 * to get whatever they wanted *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
67957:38	\[ \[ Is it , \+ what is , \] \+ what 's \] the ru- , N_S

67982:10	Is that how it 's worded *-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
68051:34	strangely enough , uh , their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up *T*-1 . E_S
68052:82	Now , \[ \[ \[ my , \+ my , \] \+ my wife , \] \+ my ex-wife , \] she quit , uh , well , when she was pregnant with the last one *T*-1 E_S
68077:25	\[ Well , \+ Well , \] when I was still smoking *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] felt that way . E_S
68080:124	If I was in a public restaurant , seated at table with , uh , non smokers I would try *-1 to pick \[ a s- , \+ \[ \[ a , \+ a \] \+ my , \] seat \] where the smoke would blow away from them *T*-2 . E_S
68097:9	so , when we 're invited *-4 to people 's house *T*-1 , he will not smoke in their house . Which I think 0 *T*-2 is good because there 's a lot of people that *T*-3 are very , N_S

68161:29	however , I did n't like it very well when the transmission *ICH*-1 went out on my car with sixty-three thousand miles on it *T*-2 . E_S
68165:32	And I do n't like it very well if , when my electric blanket that *T*-1 was only one year old went out \[ at , \+ uh , on \] one side *T*-2 . E_S
68181:14	and , uh , when I got this one *T*-1 \[ it did , a lit- , \+ it heated a little \] bit warmer E_S
68233:11	that 's what I think *T*-1 too . E_S
68249:55	But I think 0 it should have been better than that , for that money , is what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
68288:45	Well , what about the idea that one is only guilty , uh , when *-1 proven *-2 guilty beyond a reasonable doubt *T*-3 ? E_S
68296:25	But , if there are some people who *T*-1 do n't agree uh , \[ then there must be , \+ it seems *-2 to be 0 there must be \] at least a reasonable doubt for some people . E_S
68304:70	\[ \[ you , \+ you \] rarely hear , \+ you hear , \] of course 0 there 's cases where someone has been put *-1 \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ in , \] uh , prison , uh , *-2 falsely accused *T*-3 E_S

68315:53	They say 0 they 're , uh , remarkably incompetent . And , uh , do n't know what they 're doing *T*-1 and say one thing in the courtroom
68320:5	when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury *T*-1 you would think that *T*-2 those would come out E_S
68322:33	\[ when you go through , \+ uh , when you 're chosen *-1 *T*-2 \] is , you 're automatically like \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] professor in criminal justice or something like that , E_S

68607:24	I usually try *-1 to catch whoever *T*-2 's in town though ,
68651:13	So , uh , where else did we go *T*-1 , uh , E_S
68674:10	well , when we came back from the outer banks *T*-1 we came up due Norfork and spent the night there with a friend in Portsmith and then went to Williamsburg and spent a night . E_S
68741:26	and , uh , there was one year when \[ my father was , \+ uh , my father 's company was \] starting *-2 to do stuff down in Los Angeles *T*-1 , E_S
68754:62	Oh , it was great , because , uh , well , the times that *T*-1 were really fun were when , uh , we had vacation *T*-2 E_S
68765:18	there was nobody there when we were there *T*-1 ,

68890:28	\[ Is that , \+ is that \] how you got into \[ this , \+ uh , this , \] you know , uh , data base *T*-1 ? E_S

69312:45	They 've got different degrees , as far \[ as , \+ as \] how far back they can check *T*-1 . E_S
69341:73	They can go back and look at *ICH*-1 , in terms of growth \[ in a , \+ in a \] hair , when you used *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and \] that type of thing . E_S
69379:4	what are your suggestions in * making a family reunion successful *T*-1 . E_S
69388:7	well how old are you *T*-1 ? E_S
69402:8	Now how long in advance do they , uh , let them know *T*-1 ? E_S
69415:93	and then , you know , arrangements *ICH*-3 are made *-1 like during the Summer for you know , um , food and \[ who *T*-4 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] staying where , because a lot of people \[ fro- , \+ are from \] down here , in Texas . E_S
69421:11	That 's where I 'm originally from *T*-1 . E_S

69545:15	the next one was when I graduated from college *T*-1 , E_S

69697:4	What 's it like *T*-1 down there ? E_S
69761:4	What day was that *T*-1 ,
69801:7	so when it 's July and August *T*-1 , I 'm pretty well used to the , hundred degree temperatures . E_S
69812:15	Oh . Is that what Dallas is *T*-1 , E_S
69829:20	San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come *T*-1 . E_S
69850:28	but it was n't enough * to offset what they lost *T*-1 over the last four years . E_S

69918:5	when you do a lot of outside , like running and stuff *T*-1 , it 's just so much easier , up here E_S
69930:14	We get some when it 's this rainy *T*-1 , E_S

70008:14	Not like Texas where everything comes to a stand still *T*-1 . E_S

70127:63	In a big city like that most houses , I would think 0 *T*-2 , would be sort of like what we live in *T*-1 . Just a you know , basic tract house . E_S
70169:19	It really does , except when you have *-1 to fill them up *T*-2 E_S
70208:30	and I 'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten *T*-1 E_S
70316:18	I 'm not real sure what they 're going *-1 to do *T*-2 this year . E_S

70594:61	we 've done like a survey of like * taking , you know , the past three months of where all the money went *T*-1 . E_S
70599:34	but it seems like there 's , um , times when we just have *-1 to get out *T*-3 where we 'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we 'll go and we 'll blow , you know , fifty , sixty dollars in one night * going out *-2 to eat , going to a show or doing something *T*-4 , you know . E_S

70605:22	that 's the hard part because when we sit down *-1 to make it *T*-2 , we try *-3 to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week E_S
70617:83	Well , I found , uh , that , in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget *T*-6 was not where we were concerned *-5 *T*-2 , but where maybe our friends *ICH*-1 were concerned *-4 and our relatives and parents *T*-3 . E_S
70617:107	Well , I found , uh , that , in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget *T*-6 was not where we were concerned *-5 *T*-2 , but where maybe our friends *ICH*-1 were concerned *-4 and our relatives and parents *T*-3 . E_S
70681:11	that 's what my husband said *T*-1 , E_S
70700:11	that 's what you should do *T*-1 . E_S
70704:18	we really do n't , when it 's just taking *-2 out of the paycheck and stuff *T*-1 , E_S
70711:67	Well , I was just reading an article *ICH*-1 in , uh , a North Carolina \[ pap- , \+ paper \] today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by *-3 sitting up at night and typing at , uh , letters of applications to universities *T*-2 . E_S
70720:33	\[ Where there 's a will *T*-1 , \+ where there 's a will *T*-2 , \] there 's a way , right ? . E_S
70750:88	Well , I 'm sure that , uh , probably every person in this country would agree with you on that . Because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go *T*-1 . E_S
70773:80	\[ I , \+ I \] should imagine \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] \[ what the , \+ what the \] problem , N_S
70774:6	why \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] a little concerned about *T*-2 today is that this , uh , \[ rather , uh , quick \[ and , \+ and \] easy , \+ I do n't know , I should n't say easy , rather quick \] victory \[ in the , \+ \[ in , \+ in \] the , \] uh , Mideast , uh , uh , over the , uh , Iraqis , uh , might lead us into , uh , a false sense *ICH*-1 of security that we can do that against any other foe . E_S
70775:50	\[ \[ I 'm , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't know what other foe that would be *T*-1 , E_S
70784:68	and one of the things 0 we were told *T*-1 is , like , 0 they had eleven thousand HARM missiles which T I is the sole supplier for *T*-2 , E_S
70793:165	Uh , E_S \[ I , \+ I \] should imagine that , that would be * to keep it at \[ a level , \+ those levels , \] I guess , \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 were originally appropriated *-2 \[ \[ w- , \+ was \] \+ \] when the Soviet threat , I guess , was perceived *-4 as *-4 being a greater one *T*-3 . E_S
70795:18	I do worry about what nuclear weapons *T*-1 are left *-3 \[ in the territories , \+ uh , in their territory \] over there , and who *T*-2 's controlling them , E_S
70795:82	I do worry about what nuclear weapons *T*-1 are left *-3 \[ in the territories , \+ uh , in their territory \] over there , and who *T*-2 's controlling them , E_S
70801:50	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know \[ what amount of , \+ what amount of , \] our hardware *T*-1 would stop some fanatic , I guess , from *-2 doing anything , uh , that *T*-3 would be irrational . E_S
70810:43	and , uh , uh , uh , T I also makes the missile , which *T*-1 was \[ the , \+ the \] T V laser guided bombs E_S
70817:9	Oh , what *T*-1 is the name of that ? E_S
70825:37	So \[ tho- , \+ those \] are two areas in which T I stands *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] gain \[ some , \+ some \] short term business 0 *T*-2 to restock that *T*-3 . E_S
70837:11	I see where the infrastructure *ICH*-1 is sort of breaking down , the roads , the highways *T*-2 . E_S
70844:50	but I guess 0 overall , because I guess 0 I 'm not associated with what ghetto schools , \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ uh , and , \] uh , rural school systems are like *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] should imagine 0 that would take an enormous expenditure . E_S
70849:26	and , uh , the legislature just passed what they called *T*-1 a Robin Hood Bill , which , N_S
70850:10	basically , what it does *T*-1 , is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts , \[ that *T*-2 are , \+ that *T*-3 \[ are , \+ you know come \] \] from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state , that *T*-4 are not so affluent . E_S
70880:12	So , so what *T*-1 ended up *-2 happening \[ was , \+ \[ was a , \+ was a \] \] shift . E_S
70902:11	I see what you 're saying *T*-1 . E_S
70911:14	but , uh , when I look at it *T*-1 to me , uh , it does n't really make any difference . E_S
70920:37	And \[ I , \+ I \] do n't really care what it takes *T*-1 * to qualify , \[ whether you 're , uh , \[ an , \+ an \] ex- , \+ whether you 're a veteran \] or whether you , N_S
70928:10	at least what I read *T*-1 , is that some younger people feel that education is priced *-2 \[ out of their , \+ uh , out of their , \] uh , budget . E_S
70930:88	and , uh , they had completed a fifteen per cent increase \[ in the , \+ in the , \] uh , state land grant colleges , \[ which , \+ which \] *T*-1 is n't , I mean , N_S
70941:16	I do n't know what that would be *T*-1 . E_S
70961:5	when I sit and talk to people E_S there *T*-1 they tell me 0 \[ they , \+ they , \] N_S
70967:40	\[ But , \+ but , \] I 'm not too sure 0 when I put my property tax *ICH*-1 in , my car tax , my income tax , and these myriad of , uh , N_S
70968:123	now it costs me money *-2 to leave the country , some sort of a tax to leave the country , some sort of an airport departure tax , uh , uh , \[ a tax , \+ a sales tax \] which *T*-3 is getting to , uh , quite high levels , E_S
70982:52	But I mean , \[ \[ w- , \+ what *T*-1 's , \] \+ what *T*-2 's \] happened here \[ \[ is , \+ is , \] \+ is \] N_S
70995:37	Well , \[ \[ what , \+ what , \] \+ what \] they 've been able *-1 to do *T*-2 is * slow down the rate of increase . \[ To keep it , \+ * to keep it \] \[ b- , \+ \] from *-3 becoming even more obnoxious . E_S
71040:28	well , actually Wally 's had one even when we have n't had big yard *T*-1 because , um , we enjoy that . E_S
71112:61	I 've never belonged to a garden club because I 've always been more interested in *-2 just doing what I can do *T*-1 on my own , E_S
71117:17	but I know people who *T*-1 do it \[ and , \+ and \] enjoy it very much . E_S
71120:4	what I would like *T*-1 , N_S
71141:57	\[ But , \+ um , and \] usually they 're the tea type things , you know , where they have a little luncheon *T*-1 E_S
71170:34	Uh , many of those tanned until the last couple when , uh , we had such an economic slowdown *T*-1 . E_S
71176:19	well , * tell me what *T*-1 's in your garden this year , since I do n't have one . E_S
71190:19	but I like the vinca which *T*-1 is something 0 I had n't , N_S
71238:17	and I pick them when they 're very young and have very little string *T*-1 and then just steam them a little bit , E_S
71239:16	my mother picks them when they 're fat *T*-1 E_S
71285:36	In fact , \[ I , \+ \] my mother , who *T*-1 is eighty-six years old , canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year . E_S
71316:23	and I suppose 0 that 's why I enjoy gardening *T*-1 , because , you know , * growing up with it . E_S
71355:119	And I have been very , uh , happy about the new way of * controlling \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , worm that *T*-1 gets in broccoli , um , by * using the Bacillus Thuringiansis which *T*-2 is the , uh , little , N_S
71356:24	well , in fact , that 's what they use *T*-1 for gypsy moth , E_S
71366:96	so \[ \[ they , \+ they spray , \] \+ the government , uh , sprays , \] um , \[ t- , \+ \] two , three times in the spring when the , uh , caterpillars \[ are , \+ are \] coming along *T*-2
71367:8	because what they do *T*-1 , \[ this , \+ this , \] uh , bacillus , um , the worms ingest it E_S
71426:4	What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S
71466:15	I guess 0 what I do *T*-1 now is I play softball , right now , E_S
71500:4	What school you going to *T*-1 ? E_S
71511:23	Now \[ what 's , \+ what 's \] toning *T*-1 ? E_S
71526:4	what did I do *T*-1 to myself E_S
71644:46	I think 0 the last time 0 I was on a bike *T*-1 when I was about twelve *T*-2 , E_S
71647:47	I 'd be \[ afraid , \+ , afraid \] 0 I probably forgot how * to ride a bike *T*-1 , you know . E_S
71650:16	you ca n't forget how * to ride a bike *T*-2 . E_S
71662:9	Now , when I was going to *T*-1 , N_S
71724:57	And there 's some that , like the different colors denotes \[ how much they , \+ how much the tension \] I guess they are *T*-4 and how easy *ICH*-3 they are *T*-1 0 * to move *T*-2 *T*-5 . E_S
71724:91	And there 's some that , like the different colors denotes \[ how much they , \+ how much the tension \] I guess they are *T*-4 and how easy *ICH*-3 they are *T*-1 0 * to move *T*-2 *T*-5 . E_S
71736:87	If you do n't have one that *T*-1 's fun , and \[ not enjoy it , look , \+ not acting like she 's enjoying \] what she 's doing *T*-2 , the class is not going *-4 to get out , uh , what they should get *T*-3 out of the class . E_S

71743:9	Well , what are you studying *T*-1 ? E_S
71768:54	I mean , \[ \[ they , \+ they , \] \+ they \] really know how *-2 to isolate each of the different muscle groups , with those things *T*-1 E_S
71788:20	and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you *T*-1 . E_S
71803:30	\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] where I 'm really starting *-1 to get noticeable *T*-2 , E_S
71814:94	\[ I 'm , \+ I \] guess 0 I probably put on about \[ ten , \+ nine or ten \] pounds , since I stopped *-2 playing , which *T*-1 was about four years ago . E_S
71860:5	when I was playing ball *T*-1 we could like run all day and not be tired , you know . E_S
71870:38	Just that , you know , you do n't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner *T*-1 , . E_S
71896:16	\[ What , \+ what \] changes do you think 0 *T*-1 have taken *-2 place in the last generation ? E_S
71907:32	and , uh , my mom did n't work at all when I was growing up *T*-1 . E_S
71931:21	Uh , I 'm not sure what the future holds *T*-1 for that E_S
71951:43	and now they 're wanting *-1 to go back to the old days where , you know , women stayed home with the kids , you know , and try *-2 to give the kids quality time *T*-3 . E_S
71960:65	\[ a lot of , \+ a lot of \] the women that I work for *T*-1 have husbands who *T*-2 are , um , vice-presidents of companies E_S

71991:70	* believe it or not though \[ the , \+ all the \] women that *T*-1 stay home are real busy when they are home *T*-2 . E_S
72006:17	\[ When , \+ when \] your wife has her baby *T*-1 , is she going *-2 to stay home E_S
72013:4	What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
72026:42	and I see some of the problems 0 the kids have *T*-1 when they do n't have a real good family structure *T*-2 . E_S
72033:4	where \[ the , \+ the \] attitudes were a lot different *T*-1 . E_S
72066:35	\[ What , \+ \[ how do you , \+ what do you think *T*-1 ? \] \] E_S
72086:35	and back in those times we pretty much were taught *-1 how * to be responsible *T*-2 . E_S
72099:29	the bigger trend *ICH*-2 called * the boomerang kids where they move out for a while *T*-1 N_S and they come back , E_S
72100:25	and you got twenty and thirty year olds who *T*-1 are living at home with mom and dad E_S
72123:72	I guess \[ unless , \+ unless \] there 's \[ a , \+ a \] major swing in the change of what *T*-1 's important to people , you know , probably keep * going downhill . E_S
72160:5	What kind of books do you like *-1 to read *T*-2 ? E_S
72208:132	And , um , I like *-1 to read books on improve , like family , marriage , you know , things that *T*-2 are written *-3 by like Christian authors or , um , doctors about family and , you know , how * to improve your home *T*-4 and all that kind of thing . E_S
72234:4	What was the last book 0 you read *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
72270:71	\[ I , \+ I \] set a goal *ICH*-3 for myself * to read a book a month *ICH*-4 this year which *T*-1 is like about eleven more books than I would have read *T*-2 last year , E_S

72350:40	\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that *T*-1 . E_S

72366:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
72382:109	And , um , \[ I , \+ I \] like *-3 to , uh , read about people \[ who *T*-1 have been a successful , \+ you know , \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-2 made a success \] of their lives . E_S
72387:17	\[ Which , \+ what \] book *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 have you read *T*-1 that *T*-2 is along those lines , that *T*-3 was really good ? E_S
72398:13	Do you know who it was about *T*-1 ? E_S
72403:4	what the heck was his name *T*-1 , E_S
72412:4	How he started out as just a salesman *T*-1
72414:7	and how you have *-1 to , uh , be aggressive and , you know , really want something for yourself and that type of stuff *T*-2 . E_S
72415:36	It 's like up to you , in other words , whatever *T*-1 happens in your life . E_S
72437:38	Um , and I 'm not , uh , uh , a planner which I wish 0 I was *T*-1 . E_S
72465:36	\[ e- , \+ even \] though I admire someone who *T*-1 is n't , like I am *?* , you know , \[ and , \+ and \] I wish 0 I could be more that way E_S
72475:5	How many people do you supervise *T*-1 ? E_S
72517:12	That 's what I liked *T*-1 , too , is the weather . E_S
72529:48	And \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it 's \] so surprising how it just happens *T*-1 , you know . E_S
72600:49	and , well , you know , with the other part of this thing was , how do you feel that this influences family *T*-1 . E_S
72602:4	How do I feel what *T*-1 ? E_S
72605:13	do you know how * to use them in your life or to influence *T*-1 , N_S
72610:7	And what you read *T*-1 to them . E_S
72614:4	When my children \[ wer- , \+ were \] younger *T*-1 , of course , N_S
72628:23	but they do read . Uh , where a lot of people do n't have any interest in it at all *T*-1 , E_S
72633:21	because , uh , even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens *T*-1 , I mean , they do n't learn anything . E_S
72637:22	it *EXP*-4 's really surprising how many people *ICH*-2 *T*-1 graduate from high school , \[ and \+ \] that I work with *T*-3 N_S
72657:23	and I think that that 's why reading is so important *T*-1 , E_S
72661:30	because , uh , I think 0 even mentally when you can do some , N_S
72664:71	* guess 0 we got our first , uh , credit card , oh , back in the \[ seventies , \+ early seventies \] when , I first got married *T*-1 E_S
72731:16	\[ How , \+ how \] do you look at * counting credit cards *T*-1 ? E_S
72750:67	I guess for that very reason \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , if you 're not real conscious of what you 're doing *T*-1 , it 's just too much by the time 0 you get , N_S
72822:31	so , you 're a little bit more careful about what you put *T*-1 on that , even though you can use it however you want *-2 to *?* *T*-3 . E_S
72822:71	so , you 're a little bit more careful about what you put *T*-1 on that , even though you can use it however you want *-2 to *?* *T*-3 . E_S
72840:6	and who *T*-3 knows how many people , *T*-2 are looking at those , uh , bills that *T*-1 come in , and those statements , E_S
72840:18	and who *T*-3 knows how many people , *T*-2 are looking at those , uh , bills that *T*-1 come in , and those statements , E_S
72852:56	is that okay , E_S is that \[ o- , \+ okay , \] that those people see what it is that you are buying *T*-1 , E_S
72904:4	Why do they do that *T*-1 ? E_S
72926:112	Uh , so , then a couple years ago I found , uh , a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was *T*-1 , you can get a Visa card *ICH*-2 through them and no annual membership *T*-3 . E_S
72982:6	And what do they say *T*-1 about * finding adequate child care ? E_S
72989:46	They 're , uh , relatively nonexistent \[ from , \+ uh , from \] what I hear *T*-1 from my friends . E_S
72990:25	It seems like , uh , even when they have consulted day care centers that *T*-1 are quote unquote reputable , that *T*-2 are sort of like a chain , if I can use that word *T*-4 uh , still you have *-3 to deal with the people that , you know , *T*-5 happen *-6 to be operating it locally E_S
73034:35	It takes that mixture of a very mature college student , who *T*-2 wants *-1 to do something and yet is willing *-1 to give the time , and the interest to the children . E_S
73049:23	So , um , I can see where someone , you know , in a position like that , in a live-in capacity , would definitely be the way 0 * to go *T*-1 if \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] lucky enough *-3 to have the financial MUMBLEx 0 * to be able *-2 to do that *T*-4 *T*-5 . E_S
73059:70	\[ It 's , \+ uh , you know , it 's \] a terrible thing 0 * to say *T*-2 when you 're speaking of children in that way *T*-1 , E_S
73075:53	but , uh , you know , it 's just , 0 there 's so much pressure when you 're talking about two people that *T*-1 work outside the home *T*-2 E_S
73076:43	\[ and , \+ and \] I think 0 that is one reason why I continue *-1 to be without children *T*-2 . E_S
73079:21	\[ and , \+ and \] when I 've had friends that *T*-1 have said *T*-2 , N_S
73080:4	when you hear people say , \[ it , \+ it \] alters your life forever *T*-1 ,
73112:17	There are those times when I think , gee , if I did n't have children I could be out *-1 playing bridge or golf *T*-2 . E_S
73122:18	So \[ why \+ , why \] am I waiting , you know *T*-1 , E_S
73129:14	And , uh , when I seen some of my friends that *T*-1 have taken that six week old baby , you know , to someone else *T*-2 , it 's just , I can imagine how emotional it must be *T*-3 .
73129:114	And , uh , when I seen some of my friends that *T*-1 have taken that six week old baby , you know , to someone else *T*-2 , it 's just , I can imagine how emotional it must be *T*-3 .
73133:19	Well , we were lucky when our children were that age *T*-1 , E_S
73134:60	and *-2 having lived in a community for a while \[ and \+ \] we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children *T*-1 . E_S
73178:7	but when you have them in , \[ their , \+ their \] little feet are moving E_S and you have *-1 to chase them down constantly *T*-2 . E_S
73191:21	Oh , you do n't know what *T*-1 happens after they get in school . E_S
73231:4	what *T*-1 's wrong with you ? E_S
73308:4	what do I know *T*-1 . E_S
73312:33	So , uh , I 'm sort of at a loss where that 's concerned *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
73355:4	When you see all these horror stories on television about child care *T*-1 E_S
73363:22	Well , \[ what , \+ what *T*-1 's \] frightening is a parent to see things \[ that , \+ that \] you do n't really do n't understand *T*-2 . E_S
73368:24	And then you do n't really know what *T*-1 happened . E_S
73372:108	We gave up on one baby sitter because we came home one night and found pieces of , um , \[ ribbon , \+ you know , hair ribbon \] tied * in a chair . Where obviously she \[ had , \+ had , \] N_S
73381:35	so , um , \[ how do * think , \+ how do you think \] 0 we 've changed in the last ten to twenty years *T*-1 ? E_S
73419:4	Where 'd you live *T*-1

73431:18	\[ How long , \+ how long \] you been in Dallas *T*-1 ? E_S

73635:37	\[ They , \+ they \] say 0 it 's what *T*-1 makes him happy is * to give us D A D -ers grief , E_S
73708:16	\[ how , \+ how \] long are we supposed *-1 to talk here *T*-2 ? E_S
73762:29	So , uh , I 'm comparing my life when I was in high school thirty years ago *T*-1 to what I see these children doing *T*-2 . E_S
73762:62	So , uh , I 'm comparing my life when I was in high school thirty years ago *T*-1 to what I see these children doing *T*-2 . E_S
73772:29	Oh , I can not believe , uh , what they 're doing *T*-1 , uh , academically the demands on them E_S
73773:35	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] I can see why children do drop out *T*-1 . E_S
73780:88	\[ I , \+ I \] can remember 0 as a child , you know , nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where I wanted *-1 to go *T*-2 . E_S
73802:37	to N_S \[ twenty , \+ twenty-five \] years ago is when we had the Washington riots *T*-1 , E_S
73823:50	And , uh , I use *-1 to have *-2 to go over to Patterson when those riots were going on , \[ at \+ \] sometimes *T*-3 . E_S
73846:26	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] what you saw *T*-1 \[ is \+ was \] what you got *T*-2 . E_S
73846:56	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] what you saw *T*-1 \[ is \+ was \] what you got *T*-2 . E_S
73867:15	so much of what *T*-1 's going on , is so much more serious then when we were younger *T*-2 . E_S
73867:52	so much of what *T*-1 's going on , is so much more serious then when we were younger *T*-2 . E_S
73873:135	I think 0 the other thing is that , uh , we have taken some rather drastic turns \[ in our , \+ in our \] education and the way 0 we approach things *T*-1 as of maybe starting back \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm number one , you know , and , uh , uh , uh , * worrying about self and not , uh , seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family *T*-2 . E_S
73883:151	if you do n't have some kind \[ of , \+ of \] basic believe or something down inside of you , then it *EXP*-1 's very difficult * to , uh , have anything 0 * to turn to *T*-2 , \[ when you got , \+ when you 've got \] something facing you like that *T*-3 . E_S
73891:74	I also *-1 being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents , um , children who *T*-2 will lie and cheat E_S
73904:21	and you can see exactly , why the child is that way *T*-1 . E_S
73919:46	And you ca n't make up in a classroom of one hour a day , what *T*-1 's not been done *-2 for , fifteen or sixteen years at home , E_S
73952:60	Uh , you know , with farming being so mechanized , uh , people working on the family farm which *T*-1 was a traditional American way that becomes less and less likely , E_S
73968:84	And there 's \[ \[ so much , \+ so , \] \+ so many \] people on the lower end of those \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 are going *-2 to be \[ the , \+ the \] drop outs \[ and the , \+ and the \] poor and the homeless and whatnot , E_S
73970:13	And you worry when , you know \[ these \+ the \] sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children , N_S
73977:20	uh , in terms of what it 's going *-1 to mean *T*-2 to a society , in the future it 's a N_S
73984:44	\[ it 's just , \+ it just is \] almost overwhelming sometimes when you think , \[ of , \+ of \] the jobs that *T*-1 is out there *-2 to be done *-3 , in order * to flip things back around *-6 the way 0 they needed *-4 to be *T*-5 *T*-7 , E_S
74017:39	um , um , E_S for a long time \[ whe- , \+ when \] I was very young *T*-1 she did n't drive . E_S
74018:40	Uh , she learned *-1 to drive I think 0 *T*-3 when I was , um , a teenager *T*-2 , E_S
74037:102	but \[ I , \+ I \] believed after *-1 having a few teenagers that the worst time 0 you could \[ go , to \+ go \] *-3 work *T*-2 was when they were teenagers *T*-4 . E_S
74043:11	That 's why I 'm working in a school system so that I 'm home when they 're home *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
74043:50	That 's why I 'm working in a school system so that I 'm home when they 're home *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
74048:26	but it 's that you are there when they need you *T*-1 . E_S
74056:85	uh , uh , I find 0 * working in a high school is very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do *T*-1 , E_S
74068:11	as to what *T*-1 's com- , N_S
74076:25	I 'm home at three o clock when the children are at home E_S or where home *T*-1 , N_S
74091:17	I have a daughter who *T*-1 just had a second job , E_S
74093:37	and he opted *-1 to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her *T*-3 . \[ And , \+ uh , and \] looked a long time before she found one that *T*-2 was laid back enough so \[ they \+ she \] would be able *-4 to interact with them , E_S
74108:26	I do n't think 0 people realize how important it is *T*-1 . E_S
74128:20	\[ What was , \+ what was \] your name *T*-1 again ? E_S
74166:6	And what do you think 0 that problem is *T*-1 ? E_S
74185:49	\[ And , \+ and \] I 'm sure 0 they 're colored *-1 by what I 've edited *T*-2 . E_S
74187:32	Do youself have children \[ wi- , \+ \] who *T*-1 are *RNR*-2 or have been *RNR*-2 through the public school system ? E_S
74194:31	So if you were *-1 to improve it , what would you do *T*-2 *-3 to improve it ? E_S
74203:148	And then I would \[ provide , \+ uh , use \] the money that we 've paying them *T*-1 *-4 to , uh , provide some special help in training and particularly , uh , mentor teachers 0 *T*-2 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who *T*-3 may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time . E_S
74211:36	And then * let them try some innovative things and see what *T*-2 works . And then , uh , have some sort of mechanism for * passing that knowledge along to other teachers who *T*-1 could benefit from the same sorts of things .

74218:18	* Pay attention to what *T*-1 's happening . Talk to the teachers . Uh , talk to their kids about school . And support the institution E_S
74224:4	Why do n't you do something with those *T*-1 ? E_S
74226:42	Well , I 've done about all 0 I can do *T*-1 which *T*-2 is * get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published *-3 and read *-3 by a lot of people . E_S
74244:36	And , uh , that , basically , is the extent to which \[ our , \+ our \] family has been directly , you know , E_S
74256:53	The methods of * correcting it I have n't thought through *T*-1 quite to the detail which you have *?* *T*-2 . E_S
74271:98	the thing that *T*-1 worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board , you 're going *-2 to be , uh , rewarding people who *T*-3 've been doing a lousy job . \[ And \+ \] instead of getting the , uh , improvement that we want *T*-4 . E_S
74280:64	So we 'd have *-1 to have some way 0 * to , uh , reward and recognize the teachers who *T*-2 are doing a good job and give them \[ a , \+ a \] pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money *T*-3 . E_S
74293:125	so \[ it 's very , \+ it *EXP*-2 's very \] difficult * to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one , other than I guess \[ how , \+ you kn- , how \] a person scores *T*-1 in the beginning before the class and then after the class . E_S
74301:37	But some certain type \[ of , \+ of \] position where you 're overseen *-1 *T*-2 * to begin with . E_S
74315:10	at least what I used *-2 to observe *T*-3 in student teaching , was that some college kid who *T*-1 might not be all that bright * to begin with , was thrown *-7 into a class room with a teacher who *T*-4 was harried and overworked and , uh , had too many kids 0 * to handle *T*-5 and too many things 0 * to do *T*-6 and too many interruptions * to pay much attention to the student teacher . E_S
74315:59	at least what I used *-2 to observe *T*-3 in student teaching , was that some college kid who *T*-1 might not be all that bright * to begin with , was thrown *-7 into a class room with a teacher who *T*-4 was harried and overworked and , uh , had too many kids 0 * to handle *T*-5 and too many things 0 * to do *T*-6 and too many interruptions * to pay much attention to the student teacher . E_S

E_S
74334:175	Because it *EXP*-4 would n't be hard with all the electronic equipment that *T*-3 's around these days * to video tape , uh , either a master teacher teaching a class so that then , students could watch that and , uh , criticize the methods used * \[ and , \+ and \] analyze it .

74346:31	and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who *T*-2 is in New York while Jimmy 's in Rome . E_S
74357:139	I think , 0 especially in the younger years you need *-1 to have more of \[ the , \+ the \] person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed *-2 information 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] learn how * to learn *T*-3 *T*-4 . E_S
74361:40	And then everybody else is stuck *-1 with that , regardless of what they want *-2 to teach *T*-3 . E_S
74364:20	Is that because that 's where the two biggest markets are *T*-1 E_S
74389:92	And then the states that *T*-2 either do n't adopt on a state wide basis or do n't have as many kids , just have *-3 to follow along and take what Texas gets *T*-1 . E_S
74464:6	So where do you live at *T*-1 , N_S
74506:70	there 's a difference *ICH*-1 too , between east and west *ICH*-3 , in the south . And , uh , the way in which people speak *T*-2 . E_S
74514:11	That 's what I want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
74515:5	How many kids do you have *T*-1 ? E_S
74531:19	That 's kind of like what we 'd like *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
74550:5	Where you 've got *-1 to leave the furniture just one certain way *T*-2 , you ca n't rearrange it at all . E_S
74554:11	I know what you 're saying *T*-1 there , E_S
74560:32	You know we have windows in our bathrooms which *T*-1 really makes it difficult for , N_S
74566:38	\[ yo- , \+ you 're \] kind of limited in what you can do *T*-1 there and everything , E_S
74603:5	When we moved in *T*-1 the man that *T*-2 sold it to us had said that he remodeled it , E_S
74678:16	And we never know where it 's going *-1 to flood *T*-2 . E_S
74716:16	he did n't know what he was doing *T*-1 , E_S
74748:25	And we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in *T*-1 because the roof was so sorry , E_S
74753:13	I mean when we moved in *T*-1 , we had no idea how bad it was *T*-2 . E_S
74753:44	I mean when we moved in *T*-1 , we had no idea how bad it was *T*-2 . E_S
74768:16	I do n't know what it is *T*-1 off hand . E_S
74772:28	Like I said , he did n't know what he was doing *T*-1 . E_S
74782:8	Unfortunately when we were doing that *T*-1 it decided 0 it wanted *-2 to snow and hail and rain . E_S
74828:36	\[ My neighbor , \+ or a friend \] of mine when I lived in Louisiana *T*-1 , her , N_S
74888:45	but they also ended up *-1 having *-2 to pay for the damage when the \[ re- , \+ \] roof was being repaired * *T*-4 . You know , which *T*-3 really was n't our fault . E_S
74888:96	but they also ended up *-1 having *-2 to pay for the damage when the \[ re- , \+ \] roof was being repaired * *T*-4 . You know , which *T*-3 really was n't our fault . E_S
74918:4	how long have you lived there *T*-1 ? E_S
74947:103	And , I can very clearly remember 0 ten years ago I was just beginning *-1 to explore *-2 computerizing my office \[ and , \+ and \] trying *-1 to find out what kinds of computers *T*-3 might be useful E_S
74948:47	and we did end up with , uh , I B M , P C -s , which I now would not have chosen *T*-1 , E_S
74963:61	\[ I , \+ I 've \] seen that just in the last , uh , even five years *ICH*-2 how much they 've \[ in- , \+ uh , increased \] in use *T*-1 . Or probably eight years , E_S
74964:5	when I was a freshman in college *T*-1 uh , my degree was in computer , uh , technology originally E_S
74980:73	and we had *-1 to write code in binary E_S and , uh , have it punched *-2 in on those little cardboard cards which , I do n't think 0 *T*-3 exists anymore . E_S
75019:38	because , uh , now I almost never watch a T V program when it 's on *T*-1 . E_S
75024:26	I tape it and then watch it when it 's convenient *T*-1 E_S
75042:9	So , what was our question about *T*-1 ,
75050:4	How was life different ten , twenty , or thirty years ago *T*-1 . E_S
75054:73	but ten years ago , uh , I do n't know . I 'd say , like *RNR*-1 in the nineteen seventies you remember how *T*-2 kids would walk around with A M , what do you call those *T*-3 , little A M radios *T*-4 E_S
75077:61	and then you had *-1 to go *-2 find a telephone and call in *-2 to find out what they wanted you for *T*-3 and who you were supposed *-4 to call *T*-5 . E_S
75077:83	and then you had *-1 to go *-2 find a telephone and call in *-2 to find out what they wanted you for *T*-3 and who you were supposed *-4 to call *T*-5 . E_S
75101:36	\[ Where do you think 0 it 's , \+ where do you think 0 it 's \] going *-1 to go *T*-2 in twenty years ? E_S
75114:30	Uh , and they still did n't even know what *T*-1 caused it or anything . E_S
75131:4	what was your , uh , graduate study in *T*-1 ? E_S
75146:63	twenty years ago , I guess 0 we \[ 're \+ were \] just beginning *-1 to get into what they were calling *T*-2 \[ the , \+ uh , the \] sex revolution \[ where , \+ \] uh after the pill E_S
75151:51	and , I guess 0 in the seventies is \[ the , \+ the \] time when that was supposed *-1 to have exploded *T*-2 . E_S
75166:74	and I know that the expectation for them was , uh , * to have sex and , much earlier , than the expectation when I was in college *T*-1 . E_S
75188:19	It 's kind of scary when I think of what *T*-2 will happen in twenty years , you know , when I have kids and they 're grown *T*-3 and , uh , just kind of some of the changes that *T*-1 will happen even more *T*-4 E_S
75188:34	It 's kind of scary when I think of what *T*-2 will happen in twenty years , you know , when I have kids and they 're grown *T*-3 and , uh , just kind of some of the changes that *T*-1 will happen even more *T*-4 E_S
75188:68	It 's kind of scary when I think of what *T*-2 will happen in twenty years , you know , when I have kids and they 're grown *T*-3 and , uh , just kind of some of the changes that *T*-1 will happen even more *T*-4 E_S
75191:67	And I guess 0 the answer , \[ is , \+ is , \] * stay flexible because nobody can predict what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen in twenty years . E_S
75198:46	I certainly would n't have been able *-1 to twenty years ago tell you what , uh , my kids were likely *-2 to be like *T*-3 . E_S
75221:115	and that 's made a difference in the way 0 I do my job *T*-2 because it *EXP*-1 's so much easier * to get hold of people and get quick answers to things . Even when they 're on another continent *T*-3 . E_S
75251:30	And , uh , both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school *T*-1 . E_S
75254:38	I know 0 that 's \[ what , \+ uh , what \] my family was talking *T*-1 when I picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana *T*-2 E_S
75254:60	I know 0 that 's \[ what , \+ uh , what \] my family was talking *T*-1 when I picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana *T*-2 E_S
75287:10	Uh , where I live *T*-1 now \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] not so bad . E_S
75298:5	How far out from the city , I mean , do you , N_S
75303:29	I live in a little suburb , uh , which *T*-1 \[ is , \+ I guess 0 *T*-2 from Dallas is \] twelve miles or so E_S
75343:37	\[ Are there , \+ are there \] any theories on why this is happening *T*-1 ? E_S
75352:4	Why is it happening *T*-1 ? E_S
75387:9	Well , what do you think 0 *T*-1 can be done *-2 * to reduce that sort of crime ? E_S
75393:66	and there 's only eight officers that *T*-1 patrol \[ for thirty , \+ for that amount \] of people which *T*-2 is not very many . E_S
75408:15	The real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place *T*-1 . E_S
75419:15	I think 0 what they need *-1 to do *T*-2 is * stop *-3 building more jails and start *-3 giving stiffer sentences , uh , E_S
75432:24	Well , what about an innocent person who *T*-1 happens *-2 to have been found *-3 guilty ? E_S
75526:40	they 've been released *-1 , you know , several times , which *T*-2 is another , uh , deal 0 I hate *-3 to see *T*-4 . E_S
75556:16	\[ What , \+ what \] deterrent does he really have *T*-1 ? E_S
75565:37	Uh , we 've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually , you know , shot the people *T*-1 E_S
75570:25	they 've actually waited for them , where they 've robbed , you know , particular neighborhood *T*-1 , E_S
75603:22	we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in , you know , during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot *-1 to death *T*-2 . E_S
75620:23	So , you know , people who *T*-1 do n't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever E_S
75634:73	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , * giving the , uh , police , uh , agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do *T*-1 \[ when they , \+ when they \] catch these people *T*-2 . E_S
75634:104	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , * giving the , uh , police , uh , agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do *T*-1 \[ when they , \+ when they \] catch these people *T*-2 . E_S
75641:22	I think , uh , 0 what I would like *-1 to see *T*-2 is , number one , * completely getting rid *-3 of these victimless crimes .
75642:92	Uh , there 's no reason 0 * to enforce those and spend time and money *-2 doing it \[ and , \+ and \] worry about these things *T*-1 where people are getting hurt *-4 *T*-5 . E_S
75660:26	Are you going *-1 to tell me what you 've been doing *T*-2 lately in the N_S
75669:5	What we have *T*-1 here now is just a basic three bedroom , two bath , brick house which *T*-2 is , uh , completely different from what I had had *T*-3 before . E_S
75669:53	What we have *T*-1 here now is just a basic three bedroom , two bath , brick house which *T*-2 is , uh , completely different from what I had had *T*-3 before . E_S
75669:80	What we have *T*-1 here now is just a basic three bedroom , two bath , brick house which *T*-2 is , uh , completely different from what I had had *T*-3 before . E_S
75670:5	When I was working *T*-1 and before I married , uh , I lived in a little town south of here that *T*-2 is just full of old homes and , uh , historic old houses and things like that E_S
75684:18	it *EXP*-2 was amazing what I found out 0 I could do *T*-1 on my own if I just put my mind to it . E_S
75706:5	When , uh , I met my husband *T*-1 , he was living in an apartment at the time E_S
75717:37	So , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] really why we ended up in a house like this *T*-1 . E_S
75718:40	This is not \[ what we , \+ you know , what we \] want *-1 to stay in *T*-2 forever , because \[ I have *-3 to have my , \+ I 've found that after *-4 doing this other house , I have *-5 to have my \] hands into stuff E_S
75730:24	the thing is , uh , 0 when we moved in *T*-1 they had just , uh , painted , \[ wallpa- , \+ we 're , you know , wallpapered , \]
75733:46	So , uh , \[ we 'll see , \+ we 'll see \] how much longer we 're here *T*-1 . E_S
75745:18	So I know , of what you 're talking about *T*-1 , as far as the market was concerned *-2 E_S
75785:7	and when we did , uh , N_S
75808:68	I happened *-1 to go to just a little estate sale \[ that , \+ \] just a little white frame house , where the couple , uh , was very old , and had gone into nursing homes *T*-2 E_S
75828:11	That 's where I need *-1 to go *T*-2 . E_S
75872:9	But , what we ended up with *T*-1 was about four thousand . E_S
75906:36	and \[ he , \+ he \] did the digging , which *T*-1 was about six inches , E_S
75937:4	when you laid those bricks *T*-1 , N_S
76029:23	and so , I do n't know what they 're finally going *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
76035:77	Well , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 she needs *-1 to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are *T*-2 E_S
76041:4	What are these things *T*-1 ? E_S
76045:6	or what is it *T*-1 that *T*-2 will , uh , N_S
76052:21	\[ what it , \+ what it \] is *T*-2 \[ that *T*-1 'll , \+ that *T*-3 'll , \] take care of them . E_S
76080:33	so she 's sort of , uh , real funny about what she sprays *T*-1 . E_S
76100:34	\[ like I , \+ as I \] said when I heard \[ the , \+ \] what the subject was *T*-1 *T*-2 , I thought oh , gosh I have n't thought about , uh , what I went through *T*-3 at that other house in so long . E_S

76153:49	\[ and , \+ and , \] well , it 's gotten *-1 to a point where the schools are expected *-2 to take care of everything *T*-3 . E_S

76173:35	Um , and , it 's seen *-1 more so because when you call parents up *T*-2 , many parents wo n't even recognize that there is a problem E_S

76227:55	But \[ there are , \+ I think 0 there are \] a couple of areas where the school system can improve *T*-1 , E_S
76242:49	There 's no bridge area for students coming out of the E S O L , which *T*-1 is English for Speakers of Other Languages program . E_S

76283:56	\[ I personally \+ \[ I will , \+ I would \] \] take a person who *T*-1 's motivated and a little , uh , less intelligent than the person who , uh , *T*-3 is one of these very intelligent people who *T*-2 just kind of , is n't motivated * to do anything . E_S

76289:29	I remember 0 I had a college professor who *T*-1 once said that genius is one percent inspiration , and ninety-nine percent perspiration . E_S

76687:32	Well , you have n't told me , uh , what sports that you are active in *T*-1 . E_S
76802:22	an awful lot of people know where it is *T*-1 , or have been there . E_S
76857:29	Is n't it , funny \[ how , \+ how , \] your standards change *T*-1 ? E_S
76878:14	it gets to where it does n't bother , you *T*-1 . E_S
76943:11	That 's what I hope *T*-1 . E_S

76954:47	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] think that it 's getting to where they 're not spending time together *T*-1 . E_S
76959:31	like in my situation , today , on a weekend when couples are supposed *-1 to spend time together *T*-2 , my husband 's been off doing his thing all day today , E_S

77003:154	Um , from the people 0 I 've talked to *T*-1 , I do n't know if I should bring this into it , E_S but , um , a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers \[ that *T*-3 are more , \+ um , where they could manage \] their own schedule E_S and , uh , they could spend more time with their kids *T*-2 E_S
77036:20	At T I , is that where you work *T*-1 ? E_S
77041:50	some of the people that I work with *T*-1 \[ they , \+ like when I worked on second shift *T*-2 , um , \[ their paren- , \+ their kids \] \] go to school during the day E_S
77052:33	A lot of people choose *-1 to *?* , which *T*-2 is fine . E_S
77059:137	\[ \[ I , \+ ideally , it wo- , \] \+ it *EXP*-1 would \] be nice * to be able *-3 to just have , like , back in the old days , you know , back like \[ whe- , \+ when \] I grew up *T*-2 , you know , E_S
77104:20	\[ What 's , \+ what are \] some other questions 0 they have *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
77118:42	\[ it was , \+ I guess 0 I did n't realize what a luxury it was *T*-1 \] at the time . E_S
77133:48	\[ If I had kids , \+ well if you had kids , \] what kind of things do you hope *-1 to do *T*-2 ? . E_S
77180:8	and what *ICH*-2 *T*-1 's sad about that is 0 day cares end up *-3 instilling values *ICH*-5 in your kids . That *T*-4 may not necessarily be consistent with yours . E_S
77186:55	See \[ \[ I , \+ I never , \] \+ I \] do n't even know what day care is really all about *T*-1 because \[ I , \+ I \] never went to a day care center , E_S
77193:29	I do n't even remember them being around when we were little *T*-1 . E_S
77235:4	what *T*-1 are some of the things that you did *T*-2 with your children when they were growing up *T*-3 ? E_S
77235:50	what *T*-1 are some of the things that you did *T*-2 with your children when they were growing up *T*-3 ? E_S
77237:20	Oh , well , uh , when they were little *T*-1 , we did lots of reading and playing and * going to parks , and things of that sort , E_S
77270:18	they started *-1 swimming when they were , oh , seven and eight *T*-2 , E_S
77283:60	And so we would drive up *-1 to see that \[ \[ when \+ w- , \] \+ whenever \] it was reasonably close *T*-2 , E_S
77332:5	When they were younger *T*-1 we would go to the beach , E_S
77333:42	but as they got older we tried *-1 to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things *T*-2 , and that there would be \[ a , \+ a \] feature each day . Whether it would be * going to , N_S
77356:5	when they were very young *T*-1 I did not work . E_S
77359:26	well , I started *-1 working half-time when , uh , they were at the nursery school *T*-2 . E_S
77366:38	And \[ I , \+ I \] started *-1 working part-time when they were in , um , junior high school and high school *T*-2 , E_S
77374:33	I think 0 they need me more *ICH*-2 , when they were older *T*-1 , than they did when they were , N_S
77374:62	I think 0 they need me more *ICH*-2 , when they were older *T*-1 , than they did when they were , N_S
77404:5	when they MUMBLEx , you know E_S
77407:45	and my mother and I have talked about it , \[ to \+ \] how important it was *T*-1 when I came home from school *T*-2 . E_S
77407:61	and my mother and I have talked about it , \[ to \+ \] how important it was *T*-1 when I came home from school *T*-2 . E_S
77417:22	\[ when they , \+ when it 's \] not there *T*-1 they miss it . E_S
77424:8	Even when I was there *T*-1 , my boys did n't share all that much with me ,
77439:7	and when they do *T*-1 , there 's a reason for it , that they 're sharing it *T*-2 , E_S
77443:68	and \[ you want *-1 to be avail- , \+ at least I 've wanted *-2 to be available , \] when \[ they , \+ for some reason , \[ they had , \+ they were \] \] bouncing something off of me *T*-3 . Because it was something that *T*-4 was bothering them or they were concerned about *T*-4 , E_S
77454:4	Who would they ask *T*-1 ? E_S
77458:6	Or what would they do *T*-1 ? E_S
77462:102	Uh , but \[ it has been , \+ um , it 's been \] interesting \[ and \+ \] particularly \[ I , \+ I \] think because the society in which we live *T*-1 , families are separated . E_S
77467:38	Um , I mean , I grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives *T*-1 . E_S
77496:21	it 's not that constant thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins *T*-1 . E_S
77501:10	Well , when my kids were quite small *T*-1 , uh , we lived close to both sets of grandparents E_S
77544:50	and that 's part of , I think 0 *T*-2 , teaching too , is what a family is like *T*-1 , E_S
77545:22	because then \[ h- , \+ how \] do they pattern their own *T*-1 ? E_S
77567:71	but we did that \[ for e- , \+ \] from the time 0 the children were young enough * to realize what it was *T*-1 *T*-2 until , uh , our older son went away to college . E_S
77601:48	And , I mean , they look today *-1 as new as they did when \[ they gave them to , \+ she gave them to \] us *T*-2 , E_S
77608:37	and I mean , the presents have gone from the days when they were very young *T*-1 to a little box of Band-Aids and an eraser and things , E_S
77612:23	\[ to \+ today , \] where , um , sometimes I put a little gift *ICH*-3 \[ if I see something that *T*-1 's , \+ \] uh , occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save *T*-2 for \[ their , \+ their \] future *T*-4 , to sometimes , just money , uh , pieces of candy . E_S
77612:110	\[ to \+ today , \] where , um , sometimes I put a little gift *ICH*-3 \[ if I see something that *T*-1 's , \+ \] uh , occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save *T*-2 for \[ their , \+ their \] future *T*-4 , to sometimes , just money , uh , pieces of candy . E_S
77620:57	for my older boy that *T*-1 was in college I put a dollar bill for each day . Which *T*-2 was the equivalent N_S
77630:67	and \[ they will , \+ those will \] be passed *-1 on to them \[ when they , \+ when they \] get married *-2 and leave *T*-3 . E_S
77635:19	Well , you were saying what other trends are there *T*-1 , E_S
77659:31	Well , we had a sociologist at the center where I work *T*-2 who *T*-1 was writing a book on , uh , multigeneration , um , matriarchies , \[ in a way . \+ \] uh , where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she 's still living at home with the mother *T*-3 E_S
77659:45	Well , we had a sociologist at the center where I work *T*-2 who *T*-1 was writing a book on , uh , multigeneration , um , matriarchies , \[ in a way . \+ \] uh , where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she 's still living at home with the mother *T*-3 E_S
77659:115	Well , we had a sociologist at the center where I work *T*-2 who *T*-1 was writing a book on , uh , multigeneration , um , matriarchies , \[ in a way . \+ \] uh , where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she 's still living at home with the mother *T*-3 E_S
77677:14	well , Myrna , how do you get your \[ news , \+ news *T*-1 ? \] E_S
77725:4	what did you think *T*-1 about the coverage like over in the , uh , Persian Gulf ? E_S
77732:13	for a while when we were really interested *T*-1 , uh , we saw it all the time . E_S
77757:7	Well when all \[ the , \+ the \] mess \[ with , \+ uh , uh , in \] the Persian Gulf came about *T*-1 they started *-1 carrying C N N . E_S
77769:68	So , we can always run upstairs and , you know , \[ ca- , \+ get \] a quickie update on what *T*-1 's going on , if we really want *-2 to *?* . E_S
77783:74	um , I 've found that \] when \[ I , \+ I \] do n't have cable television anymore , uh , when I moved , went back to graduate school *T*-2 I just did n't have the money 0 * to \[ buy , ge- , \+ rent \] a cable T V line , or whatever *T*-1 , you know . E_S
77784:33	So I do n't get C N N , uh , which *T*-1 was a big disappointment . E_S
77803:34	and we just do n't have it available out there where we are *T*-1 . E_S
77804:7	But when we did have it *T*-1 , uh , \[ we , \+ that 's \] what we usually watched *T*-2 , was C N N E_S
77804:56	But when we did have it *T*-1 , uh , \[ we , \+ that 's \] what we usually watched *T*-2 , was C N N E_S
77814:5	when I had it *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] watched it , you know , religiously for half an hour E_S
77815:45	and then you could go on , you know , *-3 to do what else you wanted *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
77823:25	I only live about a mile from where I go to school and work *T*-1 , E_S
77847:46	so I \[ can , \+ can , \] uh , not pay attention to what our driver is doing *T*-1 . E_S
77918:104	and I find that really interesting , you know , * to imagine , E_S here is *T*-1 somebody that *T*-2 was in China , \[ le- , \+ \] two years ago when all that was going on \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , Beijing *T*-3 . E_S
77928:69	I do n't really bother with the Washington station because \[ I just , \+ \] it 's so far removed from what I 'm interested in *T*-1 . E_S
77930:15	Well most of what they 're talking about *T*-2 in Washington \[ is , \+ is \] the crime problems that they 're having *T*-1 there . E_S
77955:76	\[ an , \+ and \] it looks like hopefully she 'll do a nice job , uh , for Washington , you know , which *T*-1 is , N_S
77957:18	You know , from what I pick *T*-1 up on the news , uh , it *EXP*-3 's a difficult process , you know , * to get rid *-2 of \[ a , \+ a \] bad mayor . E_S
77970:18	and I ca n't remember where the other one lives *T*-1 . E_S
78002:16	I do n't know what the situation is *T*-1 , E_S
78037:43	\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] so funny 0 when you live in one part of the country *T*-2 you only see that perspective . E_S
78052:9	Oh , where are you from *T*-1 ? E_S
78066:58	So \[ we , \+ we \] travelled all over Europe . \[ When I was , \+ when I was \] very young *T*-1 .
78095:5	What kind of vacations do you like *T*-1 ? E_S
78130:17	\[ When , \+ when \] our children were younger *T*-1 , \[ we enjoyed , \+ we lived \] up in , uh , \[ New York , \+ or New Jersey \] \[ and , \+ and used *-2 to like , uh , *-3 traveling into upstate New York and camping E_S
78164:17	\[ When , \+ when \] we were in Jersey *T*-1 , we used *-2 to go down to the Jersey beach a lot , and really enjoyed that a lot . E_S
78194:75	\[ you could , \+ you could \] drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail \[ and , \+ and \] just really *T*-1 , N_S
78199:30	we did quite a bit of hiking , E_S which *T*-1 is kind of fun . E_S
78207:83	\[ \[ If , \+ if , \] \+ if \] there was some place \[ that , \+ that \] we went to *T*-2 where there was hiking involved * *T*-3 , \[ I , \+ I \] would be you know , happy * to go *-1 hiking , E_S
78233:64	\[ it 's a , \+ it *EXP*-1 's a \] little more , difficult * planning a vacation , when you \[ have , \+ have \] children *T*-2 . E_S
78260:21	You know , we go wherever somebody *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 , that we have n't seen *T*-3 for a while . E_S
78265:43	uh , we just came back from , uh , uh , Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate , \[ from , \+ uh , with \] his Master 's Degree in social work *T*-1 E_S
78270:113	\[ and , \+ and \] the summer \[ we have a , \+ we have \[ a , \+ a \] \] reunion \[ in , \+ in \] Salt Lake area up by Park Cities .

78292:58	I guess 0 my favorite vacation idea would be * to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep *T*-1 maybe , you know , like \[ a , \+ a \] small camper . E_S
78339:70	and I would like *-1 to maybe not take great long trips , \[ but , \+ but \] have your home base , where your home is *T*-2 and then just travel out for , like , maybe , oh , a month , maybe go , N_S
78363:88	But , uh , up the coast , uh , \[ at , \+ uh , uh , in \] Maryland and around there , \[ where the , \+ where the \] early history is *T*-1 , there 's some N_S
78375:64	we took a trip , uh , around to the , uh , Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something *T*-1 , E_S
78396:32	and then \[ when we- , \+ eventually , when we \] have kids *T*-1 , N_S
78410:21	\[ but , \+ but \] when they get a little bigger *T*-1 \[ so \+ \] they can help , E_S
78468:22	because I get so angry about what *T*-1 goes on E_S
78481:16	\[ by , \+ what do you mean *T*-1 by \] liberal , um . E_S
78491:30	Uh , \[ what 's the main , \+ what 's the main \] difference between Republicans and Democrats *T*-1 ? E_S
78495:14	it depends on what issue you 're talking about *T*-1 . E_S
78499:50	but , um , I think 0 back in the \[ ei- , \+ times \] when , uh , my political opinions were being formed *-1 *T*-2 like \[ in Viet- , \+ during the Vietnam \] war and stuff , the Republicans were more , you know , what they called *T*-3 Hawks , which *T*-4 is more like aggressive in war and more pro war , and pro aggression E_S

78638:29	if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and , N_S
78657:7	well what do you believe in *T*-1 , E_S
78658:4	what do you believe in *T*-1 , E_S
78660:21	They kind of say , well what do you want me to believe *T*-1 . E_S
78664:47	Or they word it so that it *EXP*-1 's really hard * to tell where they 're standing on certain issues *T*-2 . E_S
78668:11	I know how they do it *T*-1 . E_S
78678:20	so that 's kind of , how I judge *T*-1 . E_S
78679:19	There 's a few things where they have *-1 to say yes or no *T*-2 , like abortion or gun control , E_S
78683:30	but newspaper articles can show \[ wha- , \+ how \] they voted *T*-1 in the past E_S
78688:22	it all depends again on who *T*-1 's writing it and who they 're for *T*-2 , because they can slant that too . E_S
78688:41	it all depends again on who *T*-1 's writing it and who they 're for *T*-2 , because they can slant that too . E_S
78692:19	also the politicians put out what *T*-1 makes them look good anyway . E_S
78711:14	I mean , what would it take *T*-1 , N_S
78712:66	like , God , this is really good actually , \[ tha- , \+ for \] * to talk to somebody who *T*-1 has n't voted , E_S
78713:15	I mean , what kind of , N_S
78717:36	\[ how would it , \+ \[ how , \+ what kind of stuff \] \[ would they , \+ would you \] \] like them to do *T*-1 so \[ that , \+ that \] you would know more about it . E_S
78791:10	or like when , uh , Gary Hart was running *T*-1 , a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking , E_S
78821:39	And a lot of people go by their , uh , personal life when they vote *T*-1 E_S
78827:4	Which I guess 0 if you got turmoil in your personal life , you 're going *-1 to let it come into work E_S
78834:17	it just depends on how well you can hide it *T*-1 . E_S
78857:31	I mean , \[ what is , \+ what effect *ICH*-2 does \] that have *T*-1 on him running for president . E_S
78858:13	Do you know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
78869:55	I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run *-1 *T*-5 , is that , um , \[ \[ the , \+ the election , \] \+ the people that *T*-2 want *-3 to get elected *-4 \] are turning it into a popularity contest by *-6 advertising the things \[ that , \+ you know , that \] *T*-7 really do n't have anything 0 *T*-8 to do with how well they do the job *T*-9 . E_S
78869:267	I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run *-1 *T*-5 , is that , um , \[ \[ the , \+ the election , \] \+ the people that *T*-2 want *-3 to get elected *-4 \] are turning it into a popularity contest by *-6 advertising the things \[ that , \+ you know , that \] *T*-7 really do n't have anything 0 *T*-8 to do with how well they do the job *T*-9 . E_S
78875:13	Do you know what I 'm saying *T*-1 ? E_S
78885:14	That 's about what it looked like *T*-1 . E_S
78887:7	Well what did you think *T*-1 of Reagan as a president ? E_S
78932:13	do you know what he 's doing *T*-1 ? E_S
78939:15	You remember 0 when he was in office *T*-1 he did a lot of stuff for the Middle East , for pe- , N_S
78942:9	uh , how long have they been recycling there in Virginia *T*-1 ? . E_S
78985:85	Uh , I 've been recycling for maybe about two years now and , at \[ \[ ano- , \+ ano- , \] \+ another \] public facility where they have , you know , recycling of glass , uh , aluminum and paper *T*-1 . E_S
78994:13	and that 's what \[ I , \+ I \] do n't understand *T*-2 exactly why they do n't have that option *T*-1 . E_S
78994:50	and that 's what \[ I , \+ I \] do n't understand *T*-2 exactly why they do n't have that option *T*-1 . E_S
79010:88	but recently , uh , the refuse department \[ \[ has , \+ has , \] \+ uh , is \] working on *-1 getting a system *ICH*-3 going where we will actually have , uh , a bend that we put things in *T*-2 for * recycling these other things *T*-4 E_S
79019:56	I think 0 it 's a marvelous idea \[ when you think of , \+ uh , when I just think of \] the papers that I dump *T*-1 out *T*-2 E_S
79030:5	where I work *T*-2 they also have recycling *ICH*-1 there of , uh , all white paper and of , you know , cans also E_S
79059:76	and then , you know , they have someone that *T*-1 comes around and pick it up , you know , every afternoon which , you know , *T*-3 is an excellent idea , at work because I know the amount paper 0 they go through *T*-2 there E_S
79075:139	there 's needs *-1 to be more public , uh , service \[ of , \+ \] programs or something that *T*-2 would let us know had \[ a \+ \] happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what *T*-3 is happening E_S
79096:52	I 'd like *-1 to know , for instance , \[ when I , \+ when they \] say , uh , plastic , all plastic *T*-4 , what kind of plastic , can you put *T*-2 all together
79096:89	I 'd like *-1 to know , for instance , \[ when I , \+ when they \] say , uh , plastic , all plastic *T*-4 , what kind of plastic , can you put *T*-2 all together
79104:50	uh , now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they ca n't use *T*-1 , E_S
79109:78	but \[ I , \+ I 'd \] be glad *-2 to organize it , if \[ that \+ \] they 'd tell me what it is *T*-1 0 I 'm doing *T*-3 because \[ that would , \+ that would \] be really helpful . E_S
79120:27	another thing that I like *T*-1 here which *T*-2 is , N_S
79127:61	so all the monies *ICH*-3 are donated *-1 , you know , for the recycling to Children 's Hospital , which I think 0 *T*-2 is an excellent idea , there , you know , because the other , public , N_S
79145:43	and before even at work , N_S before they started the recycling plan , which at work they 've only been doing *T*-1 since January first of this year , I had had everyone in my department recycling E_S
79150:61	and then I would haul them , you know , here to this place for the Children 's Hospital Fund which *T*-1 got people really going into it , E_S
79176:158	I think 0 \[ they , \+ there \] needs *-1 to be a little bit more in the area \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , \[ ad- , \+ advertisement , \] and * \[ letting , \+ public letting \] you understand , more of what it is *T*-2 0 you 're doing *T*-7 , why you 're doing it *T*-3 , how \[ you 're \+ \] it 's done *-4 *T*-5 and , \[ what , \+ what \] *T*-6 happens to it because I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that \] would help a lot .

E_S
79303:32	and it has , uh , yellow spots on it which they call *T*-1 , I think , uh , liver spots . E_S
79314:4	how long have you had them *T*-1 . E_S
79319:5	when she was about three years old *T*-1 we noticed that she was having \[ pro- , \+ uh , problems \] *-2 limping and so forth E_S
79358:21	\[ what are the \+ what are the \] symptoms *T*-1 ? E_S
79383:51	winter before last we would bring her in , \[ and , \+ \] uh , when it was cold *T*-1 . E_S
79391:66	I could n't get her up without *-3 \[ p- , \+ picking \] her up \[ and \+ \] which *T*-1 it was pretty hard 0 * to do *T*-2 at eighty pounds . E_S
79408:16	Anyway , that 's when we lived in Oklahoma *T*-1 , E_S
79442:7	and when I notice in the winter , when it 's worse *T*-1 *T*-2 , you know , it 's cold weather and so forth *T*-2 then I have , uh , gotten a booster for her . E_S
79442:30	and when I notice in the winter , when it 's worse *T*-1 *T*-2 , you know , it 's cold weather and so forth *T*-2 then I have , uh , gotten a booster for her . E_S
79470:39	Um , um , well we 're living now in an area where \[ \[ we , \+ we , \] \+ we 're \] in the woods *T*-1 E_S
79510:32	So , he gets *-1 to go in and out whenever he wants *-2 to *?* *T*-3 . E_S
79519:24	He has *-1 to go out whenever , uh , we ask him *T*-2 E_S
79520:24	and \[ when he , \+ when we \] ask him *T*-1 , \[ he , \+ uh , he \] barks . E_S
79523:19	and he 'll tell you which one he wants *T*-1 . E_S
79536:5	when we first moved here *T*-1 , uh , when the dogs and I did n't fe- , N_S
79536:32	when we first moved here *T*-1 , uh , when the dogs and I did n't fe- , N_S
79578:32	so I did n't know if they stop you when the time is up *T*-1 E_S
79584:34	\[ I , \+ I \] glanced at the clock when , um , we started *T*-1 E_S
79601:4	How did you get into this *T*-1 . E_S
79676:9	Well , what are your , N_S
79710:164	The other thing , 0 \[ I , \+ I \] think *T*-5 if you do get overextended *-1 a little bit , you need *-2 to be sure and pay it off , uh , more than one at a time , because I think 0 you could run forever *-3 paying what they require *T*-4 . E_S
79716:4	Which *T*-1 is what they want *T*-2 . E_S
79716:15	Which *T*-1 is what they want *T*-2 . E_S
79729:37	There are times , \[ when it 's , \+ when it 's \] very useful *T*-1 , like , uh , emergency trip , or something . E_S
79738:25	Sometimes \[ when you , \+ when you , \] N_S
79750:16	I made that mistake when I first got a job *T*-1 E_S
79787:26	We have a boy living with us who *T*-1 works for a credit card , uh , company that , N_S
79788:23	and he makes calls to people who *T*-1 have problems , you know , credit problems , that *T*-2 are trying *-3 to work out E_S
79816:106	Even before it probably was n't *?* , though , because \[ you did n't get anywhere near as much as what it , \+ you did n't get *-3 to claim anywhere near what you \] ended up *-2 paying *T*-1 . E_S
79844:4	What do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
79860:19	and \[ I , \+ when I 'd gotten back *T*-1 I \] had gotten some sun that day , E_S
79877:7	So what 's your motivation *T*-1 ? E_S
79879:16	\[ What , \+ what 's \] my motivation *T*-1 ? E_S
79904:21	\[ so . \+ But \] when I worked out *T*-1 , I got in pretty good shape . E_S
79923:23	so \[ what was , \+ what was \] the other question *T*-1 , E_S
79932:19	and there 's other times when I just get tired of it *T*-1 E_S
79943:7	Well how old are you *T*-1 ? E_S
79961:28	well if you keep *-1 working out when you 're young though *T*-4 , when you get older *T*-3 , you know , your body 's not going *-2 to look as bad . E_S
79961:50	well if you keep *-1 working out when you 're young though *T*-4 , when you get older *T*-3 , you know , your body 's not going *-2 to look as bad . E_S
79971:13	you know , how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle *T*-1 . E_S
80028:11	I quit when I was pregnant with my kids *T*-1 , E_S
80068:35	\[ I , \+ I \] need competition , is what I need *T*-1 . E_S
80076:7	but when you get into \[ some of these , \+ some of \] health clubs where you just stand around and wait *T*-1 *T*-2 . N_S
80076:55	but when you get into \[ some of these , \+ some of \] health clubs where you just stand around and wait *T*-1 *T*-2 . N_S
80127:63	well , actually , like I say , it ai n't as bad this time , because I was in shape when I got pregnant *T*-1 . E_S
80131:46	\[ I was n't out of sha- , \+ I was n't overweight \] when I got pregnant with him *T*-1 , E_S
80151:14	Well that 's what my friend did *T*-1 . E_S
80166:4	what is it *T*-1 ? E_S
80198:17	I had a friend whose brother *T*-1 did steroids E_S
80214:41	\[ \[ i- , \+ it , \] \+ just that 's how it \] affected him *T*-1 . E_S
80275:22	Oh , \[ I , \+ when I \] did ride my friend 's bike , that one time *T*-1 , \[ I had , \+ uh , I do n't know \] what I was trying *-2 to do *T*-3 . E_S
80275:98	Oh , \[ I , \+ when I \] did ride my friend 's bike , that one time *T*-1 , \[ I had , \+ uh , I do n't know \] what I was trying *-2 to do *T*-3 . E_S
80307:5	What kind of painting are you planning *-2 to do *T*-1 ? E_S
80309:41	Well I have wallpaper *ICH*-2 in both of my bathrooms right now which *T*-1 is really pretty disgusting . E_S
80334:38	Uh , one of the books that I bought *T*-1 , where it 's \[ d- , \+ describing \] the sponge painting *T*-2 , said 0 you can like layer different colors E_S
80339:30	I 've seen that *ICH*-2 done *-1 , where there 's uh , oh , N_S
80352:27	Um , \[ what I , \+ what I 'm \] trying *-2 to do *T*-3 is 0 I 've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms E_S
80367:43	Um , and I have n't even decided as far as , um , what kind of paint * to buy *T*-1 . E_S
80380:37	Because you might find that it 's beyond , uh , what you 're willing *-2 to put *T*-1 into it . Although I think 0 it could turn out really nice . E_S
80399:38	\[ \[ What , \+ what kind of , \] \+ what kind of \] paint do you normally use *T*-1 ? E_S
80408:71	and I got *-1 to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine , uh , trim work , where I 'd use a small brush and , uh , try *-2 to keep the paint from * dripping on the windows and things like that *T*-3 . E_S
80426:55	I have heard that they 've got these steamers 0 you can rent *T*-2 now , which *T*-1 make it much easier * to get wallpaper off . E_S
80440:33	If it 's really old , you do n't know what it 's put on with *T*-1 . E_S
80490:38	Well I 'd say * tackle one project first and see how it goes *T*-1 E_S
80505:155	Because if you , uh , use drop cloths *-5 to cover everything and you use masking tape *-6 to trim out , uh , all the parts that you do n't want *-1 to slop over onto *T*-2 , you do n't have *-3 to be quite as precise about how you do it *T*-4 E_S
80520:69	And then \[ if that , \+ if you \] discover the little tricks and tips about , you know , how you get through corners *T*-1 and how you do trim *T*-2 and , uh , how long * to leave the masking tape down *T*-3 , because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake \[ when it , \+ when you \] pull it up *T*-4 . E_S
80520:91	And then \[ if that , \+ if you \] discover the little tricks and tips about , you know , how you get through corners *T*-1 and how you do trim *T*-2 and , uh , how long * to leave the masking tape down *T*-3 , because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake \[ when it , \+ when you \] pull it up *T*-4 .

E_S
80522:34	\[ It , \+ it \] peels the paint off when you take it off *T*-1 , E_S
80541:23	but I 've heard from people who *T*-1 tried *-2 to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth *?* . Because \[ it , \+ it \] rips as you pull it off for one thing E_S
80552:60	But * \[ use , \+ use \] good , uh , stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands , that *T*-1 will go down and come up easily *T*-2 . E_S
80573:19	Well , we 'll see how it goes *T*-1 , E_S
80609:26	I 've always read the NEW YORK TIMES when I was younger *T*-1 , E_S
80628:50	\[ and , \+ and , \] \[ we , \+ we \] turn it on when we start dinner *T*-1 . E_S
80642:28	I had not watched them very much except when I was abroad *T*-1 , until the Gulf War . E_S
80662:57	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ that what he , \+ he reported what he \] saw *T*-1 E_S

80683:14	I used to when I was younger *T*-1 , E_S
80686:70	or , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] also subscribe to something called * WORLD PRESS , which *T*-1 is a magazine that *T*-2 only talks about other , \[ ex- , \+ excerpts \] from the WORLD PRESS , E_S
80690:4	which *T*-1 sort of gives you a different slant , than , N_S
80697:39	and I also listen to , uh , these twenty-four hour news stations , when I 'm driving *T*-1 . E_S
80717:19	\[ is that , \+ what is that *T*-1 , \] E_S
80742:19	Oh \[ the , \+ what is that *T*-1 ,
80792:37	I feel pretty well versed \[ in , \+ in \] what I 'm doing *T*-1 because \[ I , \+ I \] do spend more time on that than I do , say , on sports , \[ or \+ \] although I watch that , E_S
80816:14	I remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston *T*-1 . E_S
80840:4	How do you feel about it *T*-1 ? E_S
80874:7	well what movies do you like *T*-1 ? E_S
80888:4	How old are you all *T*-1 ? E_S
80920:4	What 's the last movie 0 you saw *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
80925:36	\[ we were just , \+ \[ when , \+ when \] the topic came up *T*-1 , \[ we , \+ I \] was \] asking my husband right quick , what 's the last movies 0 we saw *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S

80937:19	though , I can see why it won so many Oscars *T*-1 . E_S
80974:23	Uh , once in a while , when I 'm home *T*-1 . E_S
81013:43	\[ I , \+ I \] was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was *T*-1 . E_S
81019:80	And that movie , \[ I have *-1 to , \+ I 'll \] fast forward it every time 0 they come to the part where there is *T*-2 , N_S
81024:10	The part where they 're shooting mercy *T*-1 . E_S
81032:16	I do n't see why they have *-1 to do that *T*-2 , E_S
81081:22	Of course I was a teenager when I seen that *T*-1 E_S
81151:39	She disappeared from her \[ hu- , \+ uh , husband \] who *T*-1 was abusing her . E_S
81154:61	\[ the , \+ yeah , that 's the \] one 0 I wanted *-1 to see *T*-2 where \[ he was on , \+ she was \[ on a carnival , \+ at a carnival \] on \] a Ferris wheel or something *T*-3 . E_S
81223:27	well the only reason 0 I know why it ended *T*-1 *T*-2 is 0 on ARSENIO HALL one night , Christopher Reeves told , that , you know , E_S
81230:20	\[ Or , \+ or \] who was it *T*-1 E_S

81307:16	That 's kind of how WAR OF THE ROSES was *T*-1 . E_S
81324:18	but I do n't know what it 's about *T*-1 . E_S
81430:4	why do n't you tell me about yours *T*-1 . E_S
81433:40	I live in Plano , in a four bedroom , two bath house , which *T*-1 is
81437:37	so everything around here is set *-1 up that way . Which I think 0 *T*-4 is a little bit different than most areas , in the houses , the way 0 they 're constructed *-3 *T*-2 . E_S
81459:11	You know how realtors are *T*-1 , E_S
81470:5	when I go down the street *T*-3 I can just pick out houses \[ that *T*-1 are , \+ that *T*-2 are \] identical to mine E_S
81479:4	what do you call a , uh , double ceiling , double high in one half of the house *T*-1 . E_S
81489:29	luckily I came from a house in Colorado which *T*-1 had the cathedral ceiling E_S
81491:31	and of course I felt the same airy feeling , which I liked *T*-1 it real well , E_S
81517:11	maybe someday when I feel really ambitious and \[ an- , \+ get angry *T*-2 \] I 'll start *-1 poking holes up there ,
81531:46	But of course they have a little river *ICH*-2 going down their area too , which *T*-1 is kind of nice . E_S
81554:51	I 'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have *T*-1 . E_S
81557:5	when you get down closer in to the newer tract homes *T*-1 you find almost like 0 there 's no lot line at all . E_S
81605:16	that 's sort of what *T*-1 drove me to Denton , when I first came out here in eighty-five *T*-2 . E_S
81605:38	that 's sort of what *T*-1 drove me to Denton , when I first came out here in eighty-five *T*-2 . E_S
81614:42	\[ S- , \+ so \] *-1 moving up thirty-five , I stopped when I got to Denton *T*-2 .
81621:49	so we kept *-1 going out until we figured 0 we hit a point where we need the traffic , time *-2 to get into work *T*-3 , E_S
81622:13	and that 's where we stopped *T*-1 . E_S
81652:5	What we 're more concerned with *T*-1 is the inner pollution in the city . E_S
81664:42	and we have a belt line \[ alo- , \+ around \] Raleigh where we 're trying *-1 to divert traffic *T*-2 . E_S
81677:7	and what it is *T*-1 is the pollution . E_S
81680:4	What do you think *T*-2 of \[ that , \+ uh , the \] greenhouse effect that *T*-1 's going on ? E_S
81734:16	they do n't know what snow is *T*-1 . E_S
81735:14	They freak out when there 's snow on the ground *T*-1 . E_S
81751:4	How long have you been in Raleigh *T*-1 ? E_S
81755:9	Well , how old are you *T*-1 ? E_S
81788:35	but even , uh , North Carolinians , they do n't know how * to handle cold weather *T*-1 . E_S
81792:11	that 's why I said 0 \[ we , \+ in Kentucky , we , \] N_S
81823:20	Well , you know , what *T*-1 irks me is these cars that *T*-2 are driving down the road , E_S
81852:30	Well , they 're burning that diesel fuel is what it is *T*-1 . E_S
81859:20	Well , you know 0 what they 've started *-1 doing *T*-2 \[ is , \+ is \] 0 instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they 've started *-3 putting them up at the top , E_S
81878:5	When I was pregnant with my first little boy *T*-1 , I had read it , E_S
81985:45	I mean , I ca n't believe 0 they have warnings here , which \[ it , \+ *T*-2 it 's \] mainly just when it gets real , real hot *T*-1 . E_S
81985:81	I mean , I ca n't believe 0 they have warnings here , which \[ it , \+ *T*-2 it 's \] mainly just when it gets real , real hot *T*-1 . E_S
82011:16	There was no trees where I was from *T*-1 , in Amarillo , E_S
82066:11	You know what the best indoor purifying plant is *T*-1 for smoke and stuff ? E_S
82079:22	My husband bought it for me when my daughter was born *-1 \[ three months , \+ four months \] ago *T*-2 . E_S
82092:30	Did you smoke \[ when you , \+ when you \] were pregnant *T*-1 ? E_S
82112:52	and smoking , \[ I just , \+ I \] got in the habit of it when I was about thirteen *T*-1 . E_S
82128:4	How 'd you get involved *-1 in this research *T*-2 ? E_S
82137:4	How 'd you get into it *T*-1 ? E_S
82174:16	I ca n't remember where all . E_S
82199:42	\[ We went to Pana- , \+ he went to Panama \] when Noriega was doing all that *T*-1 . E_S
82208:4	Where are you from *T*-1 Tina ? E_S
82211:26	and , um , I have one son who *T*-1 's almost sixteen months old . E_S
82227:10	Uh , what kind of things do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
82256:4	What do you do *T*-1 during \[ those , \+ those \] days ? E_S
82268:20	\[ what do , \+ what do \] you do *T*-1 ? E_S
82296:14	she worked part-time when my oldest \[ was , \+ was \] little *T*-1 E_S
82304:7	but when you have children *T*-1 it does n't work that way anymore , E_S
82322:41	but , you know , I know 0 there are some days when \[ she wi- , \+ she wishes \] 0 she was back at work *T*-1 . E_S
82327:11	That 's why I like *-1 \[ \[ to \+ to , \] \+ to \] work a couple days *T*-2 , E_S
82334:51	well \[ \[ t- , \+ see that 's , \] \+ that 's \] why I 'm glad 0 my wife did too *T*-1 , E_S
82352:10	but then when you start *-1 having two of them *T*-2 , it 's , you know , a little bit tougher , because you 've got *-3 to make a little more money , *-4 to make that payoff and stuff . E_S
82374:19	\[ Are you , \+ where are you \] from *T*-1 ? E_S
82408:4	what 's your husband do *T*-1 ? E_S
82439:166	and so \[ that , \+ that \] got me \[ to sp- , \+ to be able *-1 to spend \] more time with the kids at night and stuff , you know , 'cause normally \[ if , \+ if \] they need something they just go to mom . No matter what it is *T*-2 , E_S
82478:26	but , uh , their relationship , uh , when I was able *-2 to work in the evenings *T*-1 , uh , really grew . E_S
82542:21	you got *-1 to do what you got *-3 to do *T*-2 , you know *-1 to get along , too , E_S
82555:15	there are days when , uh , I come home *T*-1
82567:8	like what you said *T*-1 with the cost of living and everything , I think 0 a lot of people ca n't afford *-2 to get by on just one salary \[ an \+ and \] wo n't *?* . E_S
82583:32	and I think , uh , 0 the kids are where they need *-1 to , you know *T*-2 , N_S
82602:18	it *ICH*-1 's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you 've had a child *T*-2 . E_S
82607:11	* seeing how you really \[ are cre- , \+ \[ are , \+ are \] forming \] \[ this , \+ you know , the \] mind *T*-1 . E_S
82612:55	Well , you know , in the next year or so , you 'll see so many instances where , you know , he 'll mimic something that you 've done *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
82621:36	You know , \[ th- , \+ that 's \] how they 're developing their patterns *T*-1 . E_S
82629:76	\[ I , \+ I 've \] seen a lot of people just say well , you know , he 'll learn everything when he gets into , uh *T*-1 , you know , N_S
82641:18	I can just see how much , \[ of , \+ of \] a difference it *EXP*-2 makes *T*-1 * staying home with him , instead of , uh , MUMBLEx , N_S
82689:17	And foremost , uh , where we compare \[ w- , \+ that we \] are now doing fifty percent of our , uh , people are voting . E_S
82698:11	God knows why we hold it on Tuesdays *T*-1 . E_S
82716:107	\[ They hold it on the week- , \+ no they hold it on \[ a , \+ either a \] Saturday or a Sunday , \] or at least a day \[ when , \+ when , \] uh , a great number of people are not working *T*-1 . E_S
82748:39	and it is a \[ fairly , \+ fairly \] complicated process where you have *-1 to go *-2 pick up the ballot *T*-3 . E_S
82779:47	But I do not think 0 it is difficult enough * to prevent people who *T*-1 are motivated in the first place , \[ who \+ , or , who \] *T*-2 are not just motivated who *T*-3 really believe that \[ \[ their , \+ they , \] \+ their \] voice is heard *-4 . E_S

82812:23	Uh , * WAKE ME UP WHEN IT 'S OVER *T*-1 was about the eighty-four elections . E_S
82813:13	And I forget what the other books were *T*-1 , E_S
82856:12	Well , then how can a democracy work then *T*-1 ? E_S
82861:16	\[ How , \+ how \] can it work *T*-1 ? E_S
82877:43	it could be \[ c- , \+ convoluted *-1 \] in many ways where people would actually , uh , by * paying them , E_S
82893:5	When I have heard about England 's elections *T*-1 , they are allowed *-2 to run for what , a total of six or eight weeks . Even for the higher offices \[ in the , \+ in the \] land . E_S
82903:37	\[ I do n't \+ , I do n't \] care how easy *ICH*-2 it is *T*-1 for them , E_S

82912:112	\[ And , \+ eh , and , \] eh , \[ y- , \+ \] no matter what \[ a , \+ a , \] candidate promises *T*-2 during the campaign , \[ i- , \+ \] which *T*-1 is n't very much , specif- , N_S
82914:7	But whatever you are promised *-1 *T*-2 , \[ they just , \+ they just \] reverse themselves depending on who *T*-3 pays them what once they get into office . E_S
82914:66	But whatever you are promised *-1 *T*-2 , \[ they just , \+ they just \] reverse themselves depending on who *T*-3 pays them what once they get into office . E_S
82926:21	I 've read polls now where they 've excused him because there was \[ a , \+ a \] definite necessity * to balance the budget *T*-1 . E_S
82928:12	Well , then why did he say that during his campaign *T*-1 ? E_S
82939:17	\[ Wh- , \+ what \] *T*-1 was so funny about it is that , I guess , that it happened so rapidly , you know . E_S
82964:19	Like in the European countries where they have higher turnouts *T*-1 ? And , well , the newer democracies E_S
82999:58	\[ But \+ \[ th- , \+ \] but , \] you know , everything is relative to when , uh , eh , \[ w-w- , \+ you know , we \] had higher turnouts *T*-1 because at that time we \[ cur- , \+ \] talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter , right ? E_S
83004:55	\[ but , \+ but \] \[ before these enormous , \+ before this \] Voting Rights Act , what we had *T*-1 was \[ a , \+ a \] great deal of our population , uh , mainly the blacks in the south and the Hispanics were precluded *-2 \[ by , \+ by , \] uh , voting laws , uh , \[ from * reg- , \+ from their eligibility * to register . \] E_S
83016:5	when we said 0 we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen fifty *T*-1 , we really only had a fifty percent turnout E_S
83063:4	What do you mean *T*-1 ? E_S
83082:7	And when , uh , difficult decisions , uh , are made *-1 *T*-2 , uh , uh , uh , they generally prove out *-3 to be right by things that *T*-4 occur later on . E_S
83102:64	But , I mean , \[ is not that , \+ uh , is that \] a reflection *ICH*-1 then of what *T*-2 is really happening in the real world ? E_S
83109:21	I think 0 that is what *T*-1 is happening . E_S
83126:37	\[ I do not , \+ I do n't \] know how it is *T*-1 in Virginia , E_S

83169:24	Uh , I do not know exactly what the size of the juries . E_S
83187:88	But I know 0 you have a right * to ask for a jury \[ in , \+ in \] any sort of a case that even where damages \[ \[ \[ are , \+ are , \] \+ are , \] \+ uh , are \] the result of some sort of \[ a , \+ uh , an \] action that you are bringing *T*-1 against someone else *T*-2 . You can ask for that to be heard *-4 before a jury . E_S
83199:26	I should imagine 0 Virginia , from what I read *T*-1 , uh , uh , is like every other state . E_S
83225:16	I do not know what we would replace it with *T*-1 . E_S
83241:38	The benefit , I guess 0 *T*-2 , of crime outweighs what the deterrent is *T*-1 . E_S
83254:116	But \[ there , \+ there \] definitely is , uh , uh , you know , to me \[ the , \+ one of the \] worst things that *T*-1 could ever happen , uh , from what I read and see and understand *T*-2 . E_S
83261:35	Well , I would be interested in *-2 finding out what the , uh , percentage of drug related type things are *T*-1 , E_S
83276:74	I mean \[ that , \+ it \] seems to me \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] when a jury makes a decision *T*-1 , they should not be asked *-2 , uh , before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision *T*-3 . E_S
83276:137	I mean \[ that , \+ it \] seems to me \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] when a jury makes a decision *T*-1 , they should not be asked *-2 , uh , before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision *T*-3 . E_S
83302:67	Uh , after the case was over , I was like , somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way 0 they did *T*-1 *T*-2 , you know . E_S
83312:16	I do not know what they wanted *T*-1 honestly . E_S
83315:51	I mean , just because you feel like he was being kicked on , which he certainly was *T*-1 , you know . E_S
83336:35	I thought to myself , \[ how did , \+ how did \] N_S
83337:100	\[ they only , \+ I think 0 they only , \] uh , found him guilty on one count . \[ Which *T*-1 was , uh , not even , \+ which *T*-3 was a class something felony . Which *T*-2 was not even \] punishable , uh , uh , to the degree that they thought 0 it . E_S

83345:7	maybe when you are there \[ in the r- , \+ in the courtroom \] yourself and you are sitting there and you have got *-1 to make a judgment on somebody *T*-2 . N_S
83379:43	And , uh , I have \[ a fri- , \+ a friend \] who *T*-1 's real good with , uh , * repairing cars E_S
83396:5	How much was the alternator *T*-1 ? E_S
83419:85	and , uh , * took them about \[ an , \+ an \] hour *-2 to , um , figure out \[ what *T*-3 was , \+ what *T*-4 was \] blowing the fuse , E_S

83488:4	How did you put that many miles on it , in , four or five years *T*-1 ? E_S
83529:48	I was going *-1 to ask you , you know , as far as how we 're getting compensated *-2 for what we 're doing *T*-4 right now *T*-3 , um , N_S
83529:71	I was going *-1 to ask you , you know , as far as how we 're getting compensated *-2 for what we 're doing *T*-4 right now *T*-3 , um , N_S
83532:16	I do n't know what you want *-1 to call them *T*-2 ,
83540:23	and , uh , I just wondering how I go about *-1 getting the cash *T*-2 . E_S
83581:71	\[ I , \+ I \] just bought it from a friend \[ who *T*-1 was going *-2 to , \+ who *T*-3 just \] charged me what the dealer was going *-4 to \[ give , \+ give \] him *T*-5 for it for a trade-in , E_S

83586:41	and then I gave it to a guy *ICH*-3 *-4 to repair who *T*-1 works \[ for the aut- , \+ for the Audi \] dealer E_S
83602:35	and , Oh , \[ tha- , \+ that 's \] when they made cars *T*-1 , though , N_S
83641:20	I just do n't know how much they 'll want *-1 to charge me *T*-2 *-3 to , N_S
83688:35	And I have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done *T*-1 because it has always been incorrectly planted *-2 E_S
83692:52	And so I am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going *-1 to do *T*-2 is 0 we are just going *-3 to struggle through the rest of this year , probably through the Fall too . And , uh , \[ rip up , \+ rip out \] all the rest of these junipers or anything that *T*-4 requires , uh , more care than I am willing * to give the kids *T*-5 and replace it with hollies . E_S
83699:10	Uh , how many kids do you have *T*-1 ? E_S
83708:28	\[ What year , \+ I mean , how old \] are they *T*-1 ? E_S
83770:19	\[ the lea- , \+ when the blooms died *T*-1 , the leaves \] were just horrible looking . E_S
83818:52	But I have just learned from *-1 doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do *T*-2 is 0 you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done *-3 blooming . Because they do not take the heat here . E_S
83835:11	That is what they call them *T*-1 down here . E_S
83837:37	\[ I do not , \+ I am not \] sure what they are called *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
83839:35	\[ When does it , \+ \[ Wh- , \+ when \] does it \] bloom *T*-1 ? E_S

83858:21	well , I do not know what I have called them *T*-1 . E_S
83859:7	But when I come down here *T*-1 , everybody told me 0 they are flags . E_S
83861:11	You know what I bet you *T*-1
83882:4	what color \[ is , \+ is \] yours blooming *T*-1 ? E_S
83884:44	I have got some in the backyard that *T*-1 bloomed blue . Which I \[ would not , \+ would have \] liked *T*-3 those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better . And then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color . With little purple spots that \[ it , \+ *T*-2 it \] will fade into a solid purple . E_S
83886:6	And what does the foliage look like *T*-1 ? E_S
83899:52	Oh , \[ I bet you 0 those are , \+ I bet you 0 what those things are *T*-1 , \] uh , is a Dutch iris . E_S
83956:22	and they had took root right where they were *T*-1 , on top of each other . E_S
83970:37	\[ I do not , \+ I am not \] sure what it is *T*-1 . E_S
83978:45	Well , I am not so sure that Texans know \[ what , \+ what \] they have got *T*-1 . E_S
83983:16	I do not know what it is *T*-1 . E_S
84007:89	But it *EXP*-2 has been about three or four years of , uh , uh , * playing around with flowers * to \[ de- , \+ decide \] which ones *T*-1 actually grow here . E_S
84038:16	well , that is where I went *T*-1 this year . E_S
84050:11	That is what I did *T*-1 with my plants . E_S
84108:4	How do you spell that *T*-1 ? E_S
84123:5	How big a city is Rome *T*-1 ? E_S
84140:16	and it is stripped when you come back *T*-1 . E_S
84193:42	well , we live in \[ north Tex- , \+ north Dallas \] which *T*-1 is \[ like a suburb , \+ near a suburb \] called * Plano . E_S
84217:40	so I do not know \[ what , \+ you know , what \] *T*-1 can be done *-2 . E_S
84235:22	and this thing *ICH*-2 came on where \[ these , \+ a group \] of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street \[ and , \+ and \] robbing them *T*-1 . E_S
84248:59	Like that girl in New York that *T*-1 got beat *-2 up by , you know , N_S when she was jogging in Central Park *T*-3 , a couple of years ago ? E_S
84269:4	How \[ s- , \+ deprived \] could they be *T*-1 if they had a camcorder ? E_S
84285:16	And you are wondering how , you know . Um , we lived in Minneapolis and Wisconsin *T*-1 . E_S
84288:16	I do not know what the world is *T*-1 or is not *T*-1 .
84309:11	I wonder where he gets it *T*-1 ? E_S
84315:47	I mean , \[ I do not , \+ I do not \] know how it is *T*-1 in the Air Force base . E_S
84328:16	I do not know how your folks were *T*-1 , E_S

84346:16	I do not know how old you are *T*-1 , E_S
84351:35	but \[ it 's , \+ that 's \] just what it is *T*-1 . E_S
84368:29	especially since a lot of us are engineers where I work *T*-1 . E_S
84390:31	and I am like , you are the one who *T*-1 signed up . E_S
84444:10	No matter who they are *T*-1 E_S or where they are at *T*-2 , you know . N_S
84444:28	No matter who they are *T*-1 E_S or where they are at *T*-2 , you know . N_S
84447:16	And you never know who *T*-1 is watching , either . E_S
84467:36	I mean , in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should *RNR*-2 or should not *RNR*-2 do *T*-1 . E_S
84468:4	How * to carry your wallet *T*-1 ,
84510:32	But I just looked at the picture and thought , what a world . E_S
84603:59	I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I could go on and on about what * to do *T*-1 about criminals .
84619:16	I do not know how the New York state prison system is *T*-1 E_S
84643:18	And you are like , why are they repeating *T*-1 ? E_S
84660:21	They wanted *-1 to see what it *EXP*-3 was like *T*-2 * to kill someone . E_S
84664:37	So \[ they , \+ they \] picked on this kid who *T*-1 was like new in town . E_S
84674:4	How can you even think like that *T*-1 ? E_S
84680:69	my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of *T*-1 that I am just going , Michael , how did you hear about that *T*-2 *T*-3 ? E_S
84691:14	In Atlanta , where my inlaws live *T*-1 , uh , they had that thing , you know , the high top sneakers , the Air Jordans , et cetera . E_S
84711:69	Uh , I mean , it is I guess , it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that \[ they , \+ in Boston . \] E_S
84712:14	That is crime where they videoed *T*-1 . E_S
84717:4	Where they videotape themselves *T*-1 . E_S
84722:76	Well , Wayne , I , uh , feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children , and making time available even sometimes when time is n't available *T*-1 . E_S
84723:4	How do you feel about it *T*-1 ? E_S
84741:52	and I 've always tried *-1 to do things with them , uh , like , when you 're at the little league *T*-2 , * helping out even though I 'm not a good athlete myself , E_S
84753:23	and \[ we have , \+ where we 've \] lived *T*-1 , we 've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area , E_S

84755:76	And \[ it 's just , \+ uh , it *EXP*-2 's \] helps , I think , the children \[ to , \+ when they 're learning in school *T*-1 , * to \] say , well , I 've been there
84777:45	And we could , uh , read the things in the history books and understand what they said *T*-1 , when it was like , \[ we need food , \+ we need *-2 to raise food \] quickly because this place gets very cold very soon *T*-3 . E_S

84798:68	Well , I can remember 0 one of the things 0 I 'm most proud of *T*-1 is , uh , when my son was , N_S
84800:61	they had *-1 to write \[ a , \+ a \] little brief autobiography of themselves , and about what they had done *T*-2 and what they wanted *-4 to do *T*-3 , E_S

84801:18	and I was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted *-2 to , uh , have a family and be able * to help *-1 coach little league and do things like his dad had done *T*-3 with him *T*-4 . E_S
84833:7	and when I signed up for it *T*-1 , it , uh , looked like it could \[ be , \+ make \] a real contribution in * participating . E_S
84859:11	It 's where we originally started out *T*-1 , E_S
84861:52	So , * wound up back about two hundred miles \[ aware , \+ away \] from where we started out *T*-1 . E_S
84878:9	Um , what do you think 0 the major cause of air pollution or at least in the Boston areas , N_S
84882:38	so it *EXP*-2 's kind of hard for me to tell what *T*-1 would happen if I lived in some of the valleys inland , E_S
84932:58	I think \[ 0 it 's \+ now , \[ is what , \+ uh , from what \] I understand *T*-1 it 's \] air conditioning units E_S
84947:19	I mean you know what it 's like *T*-1 here . N_S
84994:58	every car *ICH*-4 now in America that *T*-1 's been produced *-3 for the past fifteen years has what they call *T*-2 a catalytic converter . E_S
85013:25	and * passing the law depends on how heavy \[ the car industry , \+ the automobile lobby \] is *T*-1 . E_S
85053:27	up here in New England , uh , where I 've , N_S
85054:13	right close to where I live *T*-1 is *T*-2 the Seabrook Nucleus site which *T*-3 is , practically a , you know , guerilla war up here ,
85054:43	right close to where I live *T*-1 is *T*-2 the Seabrook Nucleus site which *T*-3 is , practically a , you know , guerilla war up here ,
85067:153	my feelings were that we needed this bridge *-3 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ uh , to \] \[ \[ m- , \+ m- , \] \+ jump \] \[ from whatever it was going *-1 to be *T*-2 , \+ from fossil fuel to whatever it was going *-4 to be *T*-5 . \] E_S
85104:20	and we just feel that when we leave , uh , this area *T*-1 , \[ w- , \+ we 're \] going north , not south . E_S
85117:124	\[ But , \+ um , so , \] \[ \[ I , \+ i- , \] \+ I 'd \] be interested in *-4 having spoken with somebody *ICH*-1 also from the far west on this issue *-2 to see how \[ they , \+ their \] attitudes are *T*-3 . E_S
85220:25	and , uh , it was practically new when I moved in here *T*-1 E_S
85237:22	On the first floor , um , where I am *T*-1 , there 's a patio . E_S
85283:44	The past , uh , uh , year and a half prices have gone down which *T*-1 is totally new for northern Virginia . E_S
85292:20	All the developers do n't know what * to do *T*-1 . E_S
85326:12	two family house where \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ um , the \] downstairs and the second floor 0 they had , N_S
85345:14	and that 's what he said *T*-1 was that , you know , it just was n't something that people had *T*-2 down there . E_S
85372:42	Um , E_S there are some areas *ICH*-2 though \[ where , \+ where \] they have a problem with , uh , the houses kind of sinking a little bit \[ into the , \+ to the , \] uh *T*-1 , N_S
85377:80	But \[ you , \+ you \] have *-1 to know the right spot , 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] pick *T*-3 where that does n't happen *T*-2 . E_S
85385:45	Well , out here \[ we , \+ um , we \] live in what *T*-1 used *-2 to be , uh , like a prairie or whatever a \[ natural , \+ you know , natural \] grasslands . E_S
85395:16	And so any place where they put a basement in *T*-1 they had *-2 to blast . E_S
85402:4	Where did you say 0 you 're at , *T*-1 Colorado ? E_S
85452:11	That 's why we came out here *T*-1 . E_S
85497:25	I sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up *T*-1 . E_S
85501:38	Uh , my folks , um , had an apartment for a while when we were kids *T*-1 E_S
85570:16	and their idea of what *T*-1 is justice is totally different from ours . E_S
85613:60	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , , I think 0 some different things *ICH*-2 could come from what *T*-1 's happened *T*-1 , than what we expect *T*-3 . E_S
85613:82	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , , I think 0 some different things *ICH*-2 could come from what *T*-1 's happened *T*-1 , than what we expect *T*-3 . E_S
85659:38	They would n't have understood anything \[ else \+ \] than what we did *T*-1 in the war . E_S
85675:19	I ca n't figure out why they adored him *T*-1 . E_S
85684:69	because \[ I , \+ I 've , \] you know , traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I 've done that *T*-1 E_S
85696:17	You know , and when you add the , um , commercialization of the western world *T*-1 it sort of screws everything up for them . E_S
85709:5	What *T*-1 's sad is that the leaders that *T*-2 have control are power , E_S
85724:4	Which I think that *T*-2 that 's not \[ the , \+ the \] way 0 the majority of the people over there really are *T*-1 . E_S
85727:20	So it 's really hard , when you see the leaders , compared to the people *T*-1 . E_S
85729:176	But \[ I think 0 \[ in a , \+ in a \] way the war , \+ uh , I think 0 in a way all , the involvement \] over there too , though , has shown \[ a lot of people \+ that there are a lot of people \] that *T*-1 do n't follow what those few are doing *T*-2 . E_S
85730:25	And there are a lot of people who *T*-1 are good people . E_S
85752:16	* Does n't matter where the boundaries are *T*-1 .
85757:48	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 so much of it is what you 're taught *T*-1 . E_S
85780:27	I think that they have a system where , uh , \[ they , \+ the government \] deals \[ with the , \+ with , \] N_S

85788:66	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] think that *ICH*-3 , uh , again *-2 having gone through a period when I was out of work and had *-1 to buy health insurance on my own *T*-4 , if you do n't have a company \[ supporting you in the , \+ \] uh , picking up the major portion of your health insurance , the cost is \[ p- , \+ almost prohibitive . \] E_S
85799:80	they could make it , \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ \] provide health insurance \[ to , \+ to \] people who *T*-2 could n't afford it just by the money 0 they would save *T*-1 . E_S
85802:21	Uh , we 're currently , where I 'm working now , under Blue Cross *T*-1 . E_S
85805:16	I do n't know what the total cost of the program is *T*-1 E_S
85823:18	or one of , whatever the type name is *T*-1 , H M O , uh , \[ where the , \+ uh , where \] you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest *T*-3 .

85838:11	I forget how much I paid *T*-1 a month E_S
85856:87	You know , a lot of people complain *-1 saying well , I do n't want *-4 to , uh , have *-5 to be told *-6 who I need *-2 to go to *T*-3 E_S
85925:56	you have *-1 to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building , uh , when the \[ e- , \+ \] rooms are empty *T*-2 . E_S
85930:20	and , uh , that 's how you come up with aspirin that *T*-1 costs four dollars apiece and things like that . The horror stories that you hear *T*-2 about people going into the hospital for a week and , uh , it being , a four thousand dollar bill *T*-3 . E_S
85937:98	Well , \[ they , \+ \[ and \+ \] you know , they 're \] also p- , N_S take- , N_S they 're taking up the cost of people who *T*-1 ca n't pay . E_S

86145:5	what we did *T*-1 in some of the other cities E_S and they tell you *-1 to do that is * to hire a local guide E_S

86360:46	I guess 0 I relate it \[ to , \+ to \] Japan where things are very expensive *T*-1 , are n't they *?* *T*-1 ? E_S
86427:20	and I started *-1 hunting when I was twelve years old *T*-2 . E_S
86442:175	And I believe that too because the person that *T*-2 is wanting *-1 to , commit a crime is going *-3 to find a way 0 * to get \[ \[ a gum , \+ a gu- , \] \+ a gun , \] a knife , \[ a , \+ a \] rock , a stick , whatever it is *T*-4 , 0 * to commit a crime with *T*-5 *T*-6 , E_S

86465:46	There was \[ a \+ an \] article in the paper just this week where I think 0 it 's , uh , *ICH*-1 one of the gun companies , I ca n't remember which , was developing a \[ ten metal , \+ ten millimeter \] automatic pistol for the F B I which *T*-3 would give them additional firepower *T*-2 .

87182:41	I just love *-1 sharing meals \[ and , \+ and \] whatever you can do *T*-2 , you know , * to do that . E_S

87606:87	so \[ I 'm no- , \+ I 'm , \] uh , think that \[ the , \+ \] we really ought *-1 to seriously consider what an income tax might do *T*-2 \[ that , \+ uh , for \] Texas E_S
87628:64	and if it were n't for the taxes 0 we 're putting *T*-1 in there , uh , * look what the schools could cost you *T*-2 . E_S
87634:21	\[ we 'd , \+ when we \] moved to \[ R- , \+ Richardson *T*-2 , \] one of the reasons 0 we chose it *T*-1 was \[ for the , \+ uh , for the \] schools .
87650:40	uh , \[ I believe , \+ I do n't know \] which one it is *T*-1 *ICH*-3 , uh , down there whether it 's Hobby or , uh , the other ex-governor down there that *T*-2 are proposing *-4 doubling the tuition . E_S
87687:94	But all the various taxing authorities that *T*-1 come through , I think 0 the one tax 0 I resent *T*-4 the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which *T*-2 is probably never going *-3 to be in existence in my lifetime . E_S
87694:28	You had *-1 to start your public transportation when you started your cities *T*-2 . E_S
87696:93	If we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that , and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and , uh , construction costs were cheap *T*-1 , you could afford it . E_S
87709:38	and the other thing is that \[ when it , \+ when \] \[ it 's , \+ the public transportation is \] established *-3 that early on *T*-1 \[ then , \+ then \] the \[ business , \+ uh , business \] and residential patterns develop *-2 to take advantage of that . E_S
87722:24	* just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system * to get them everywhere *T*-1 . E_S
87727:36	and some , people do n't even own a car and know how * to drive a car *T*-1 . E_S
87758:51	So , but \[ I , \+ here again I \] think MUMBLEx 0 I resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt . \[ So \+ \] and doing all these studies and the things *T*-1 E_S
87792:6	So what movies have you seen *T*-1 lately ? E_S
87798:4	Which *T*-1 was a , N_S
87827:4	how do you mean *T*-1 ? E_S
87845:68	but you might not be \[ so \+ you know , so \] encouraging , of Susan Sarandon and then Gena Davis when they do it *T*-1 . E_S
87852:5	When the shoe is on the other foot *T*-1 and see how it , N_S
87852:36	When the shoe is on the other foot *T*-1 and see how it , N_S
87865:16	that 's kind of what it was *T*-1 . E_S
87876:28	Before we found the shopping malls that 's what we did *T*-1 . E_S
87902:48	I guess 0 she does it for the social value of * showing you what trash is *T*-1 ,
87940:20	MUMBLEx she 's smart at what she does *T*-1 . E_S
87941:11	She knows how * to do that *T*-1 . E_S
87943:11	She knows how * to twist this around *T*-1 ,

87956:4	How can I tell you *T*-1 . E_S
87967:39	Um , and I only bring up WOUNDED KNEE because that was what ten years ago you read \[ and , \+ and \] understood *T*-1 , you know , about the \[ American pop , \+ Indian population , \] E_S
87976:48	And , you know , it 's sort of a popular view of , um , what *T*-1 happened way back then . E_S
87987:9	Well , who *T*-1 knows . E_S
88003:25	because they made a big deal about how \[ this , \+ this \] film was such a big leap for \[ the , \+ the \] people \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 were the ancestors of \[ the , \+ this \] Indian tribe *T*-2 E_S
88003:99	because they made a big deal about how \[ this , \+ this \] film was such a big leap for \[ the , \+ the \] people \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 were the ancestors of \[ the , \+ this \] Indian tribe *T*-2 E_S
88020:84	\[ I , \+ um , I \] have come *-1 to respect a little bit more \[ the , \+ \] uh , you know , what *T*-2 went on here , E_S

88029:213	You know \[ on the , \+ on the \] broad scope I mean , um , like if , uh , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it \] had a much bigger thing I thin- , N_S meaning to me N_S I think about , you know , just the meaning of , um , the freedom of this country \[ and , \+ and \] what that really meant *T*-1 . E_S
88054:31	I looked at my watch only a few times , which *T*-1 is a good thing . E_S
88068:21	there were three of us who *T*-1 went . E_S
88069:36	We were just all \[ grou- , \+ really grouchy \] when it was over *T*-1 . E_S
88096:29	but we still felt the thick blame for , what *T*-1 had gone on . E_S
88108:24	and , um , you know , when the truth ,
88135:44	Um , I rented a good movie , um , called * CINEMA PARADESO which *T*-1 is an Italian movie which *T*-3 is probably the best movie 0 I 've seen *T*-2 ever . E_S

88150:41	There 's \[ a little , \+ oh , an old \] man who *T*-1 's the projectionist E_S

88241:39	And I have a sister-in-law \[ who *T*-1 is , \+ who *T*-2 works \] in the Fort Worth school district . E_S
88254:5	whenever we go over and visit grandma *T*-2 the kids love *-1 to play the computer game , E_S

88355:14	That 's probably where you 've used it *T*-1 . E_S

88370:11	That 's what I 've heard *T*-1 . E_S
88375:113	some of the commands just had nothing 0 * to do *T*-4 with , you know , \[ what you were supposed *-2 to be doing *T*-3 \+ \[ what they , \+ what they \] did *T*-1 on the \[ com- , \+ computer \] \] E_S

88413:16	And I think about how it used *-1 to be *T*-3 if you were doing a paper and you had *-2 to go back and retype everything , E_S
88432:23	\[ What kind of , \+ what kind of \] things do you write *T*-1 ? E_S
88459:26	Oh . Trying * to figure out what all that was about *T*-1 , huh ? . E_S

88480:64	but \[ I , \+ I \] just know right now that I could n't have put out half of what I did *T*-1 if that much without the being in computers E_S
88496:36	My nine year old I 've decided *-1 to teach her how * to type * using the computer *T*-2 , E_S
88574:4	How old is she *T*-1 ? E_S
88578:37	Uh , I guess 0 you have not reached the stage where you need *-1 to , uh , promote a college or anything *T*-2 , huh . E_S
88597:48	well , * help them make *?* in terms of , you know , what \[ they are , \+ they are \] wanting *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S

88616:60	So , uh , you know , you need *-1 to go to a school that *T*-2 handles whatever it is *T*-3 0 you want *-4 to do *T*-5 . E_S
88619:4	Where did you go to school *T*-1 ? E_S
88634:34	But \[ I , \+ \] I mean , so what 's , MUMBLEx , N_S
88636:4	What 's the criterion for * choosing *-1 to go there *T*-2 ? E_S
88675:5	when you said 0 it was \[ quite a , \+ quite a \] way away *T*-2 , I did not know 0 \[ it \+ that \] meant 0 you had *-1 to drive like an hour E_S
88706:46	And , uh , you know , I guess , you know , 0 when you have *-1 to do it that way *T*-2 , it \[ makes , \+ makes \] your choices a lot easier E_S
88711:42	\[ that , \+ that 's \] like , you know , when I went on *-1 to get \[ my , \+ my \] master 's *T*-2 \[ I , uh , basically was , \+ you know , it was where I was *T*-3 \] at the time . E_S

88724:26	\[ But , \+ uh , so \] when you are first going to school *T*-4 \[ that , \+ \] you kind of have the luxury of *-1 being able *-2 to have some latitude in * choosing the place 0 * to go *T*-3 . E_S
88730:17	\[ Wh- , \+ which \] group *ICH*-2 do you work in *T*-1 in T I ? E_S
88734:14	Oh , uh , where is that at *T*-1 ? E_S
88739:4	How long do you work for T I *T*-1 ? E_S
88763:37	My undergraduate degree was \[ not in , \+ not in \] what my master 's was *T*-1 . E_S
88776:18	Uh , depending on what they want *-1 to specialize in *T*-2 and what you can afford *T*-3 , different things like that , E_S
88776:47	Uh , depending on what they want *-1 to specialize in *T*-2 and what you can afford *T*-3 , different things like that , E_S
88784:32	\[ I , \+ I \] like the school where I went *T*-1 . E_S

88795:51	Or the school where I got my master 's at *T*-1 , \[ which , \+ which \] *T*-2 was a different school . E_S

88969:125	\[ \[ the guy , \+ the guy \] that *T*-1 played in it , \+ he was not the star , but the one that *T*-2 played in it \] that I liked *T*-3 best was the one who *T*-4 was in , uh , oh , the one about the old people . E_S

89123:8	Even when he 's sad *T*-1 , you know , you great faith that he will get happy again . E_S
89183:17	It was the one where he was a defense *T*-1 , N_S

90191:22	\[ When , \+ um , when \] he was in first grade *T*-1 , he had trouble \[ with , \+ with \] spelling , E_S
90257:90	\[ and I , \+ and I \] thank God 0 I 'm here , because \[ I , \+ I \] know 0 I have a sister who *T*-1 has the other extreme . E_S
90258:41	She has \[ a , \+ a \] child *ICH*-2 in Connecticut who *T*-1 is extremely gifted , E_S
90267:46	\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] like * having a child who *T*-1 has a learning disability that *T*-2 's being ignored *-3 ,
90351:118	I know 0 Steven probably would not be accepted *-1 because he has a learning disability \[ and , \+ \] into a private school . \[ And , \+ \] um , \[ which *T*-3 is , \+ which *T*-2 is \] too bad . E_S
90360:18	and they , can do whatever they want *T*-1 . E_S
90381:18	And I have a problem when they compare the kids in Japan or Germany to the kids here *T*-1 . E_S
90382:133	\[ \[ In , \+ in , \] \+ in , \] uh , \[ ho- , \+ honesty , \] the kids in Japan \[ are , \+ they have \] *-1 to try out *-3 to even get into , to which kindergarten they 're going *-2 to get into *T*-4 , E_S
90388:52	\[ the , \+ \] in fact , they 've had cases *ICH*-1 in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten , which *T*-2 means 0 they probably wo n't get into the top elementary \[ and , \+ and \] high school *T*-3 , E_S
90388:99	\[ the , \+ \] in fact , they 've had cases *ICH*-1 in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten , which *T*-2 means 0 they probably wo n't get into the top elementary \[ and , \+ and \] high school *T*-3 , E_S
90392:40	and if they do n't , \[ then af- , \+ \] when they reach a certain age *T*-1 , \[ they just , \+ \] that 's the end of their schooling . E_S
90416:69	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere \[ where they , \+ where they \] said that , you know , these children , \[ they , \+ they \] had *-2 to be the best *T*-1 , E_S
90425:37	but on the other hand , I feel like my children , who *T*-1 are kind of middle of the road , \[ have , \+ are \] more rounded , you know . E_S
90440:16	And so that 's why I said , 0 their childhood is extremely different from mine *T*-1 . E_S
90496:16	Uh , that 's where the family grew *T*-1 . E_S
90575:8	originally when we had them *T*-1 , uh , they were mainly my mother 's , E_S
90596:19	or , you know , what we are left *-2 with *T*-1 is \[ the , \+ the \] relatives \[ \[ of , \+ of , \] \+ of \] that group . E_S
90605:16	\[ Wh- , \+ why \] do you think that it 's less close than it used *-1 to be *?* *T*-2 ? E_S
90608:16	\[ when , \+ when \] they were a- , N_S
90616:45	You know , back around , you know , in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up *T*-1 , uh , you know , they were all located *-2 together , in one small community . E_S
90624:49	And \[ \[ as , \+ as \] time grew , \+ I mean when time went on *T*-1 the family grew \] and moved away and so forth . E_S
90625:10	And now when they come together *T*-1 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] generally , you know , N_S
90626:25	like say the kids of those people who *T*-1 are not , you know , anywhere near one another
90627:80	and I do not think 0 they feel \[ the , \+ the \] closeness that they *T*-3 used *-4 to be there . Which *T*-2 is a shame E_S
90631:16	but that 's just how it is *T*-1 . E_S
90707:39	Uh , you know , \[ and , \+ and \] generally when I was growing up *T*-2 a lot of those people , the only time 0 I ever saw them *T*-1 was at the reunion , E_S
90727:7	and what you do *T*-1 is * take out the last letter 0 you wrote *T*-2 that *T*-3 's on the bottom and put \[ the , \+ your \] new letter on the top , E_S
90729:44	And then , about twice a year then you are kept *-1 up with what *T*-2 is going on
90730:7	and when you meet them at the reunion *T*-3 , you do not feel like , I do not know anything about this person . E_S
90731:24	You have , read something about what *T*-1 is going on and about their children and so forth . E_S
90779:30	Well , \[ what 's your ca- , \+ what 's your interest *T*-1 , \] E_S
90793:42	And , uh , my area of expertise , it 's information systems , which *T*-1 is a little bit less technical , I think , \[ than , \+ uh , than \] computer science . E_S
90798:29	And I think 0 that 's one reason why I 'm part of this study *T*-1 , uh , because \[ it 's of , \+ \] I 'm working with voice systems . E_S
90805:32	\[ \[ Wh- , \+ what , \] \+ what \] type of advice do you think 0 you 'd give *T*-1 to \[ a , \+ a \] parent ? E_S
90812:73	and the kid at that age , especially if they 're going into undergraduate , it seems like they think 0 they know what they want *T*-1 . E_S
90819:101	\[ An , \+ and , \] I mean , * choosing from my experience , you know , I thought , you know , 0 \[ my , \+ I know what I want *T*-2 a lot more than my \] parents know what I want *T*-1 . E_S

90824:33	at the same time , you have *-1 to decide what *T*-2 is important about the school , E_S
90834:21	I think 0 that 's what you just said *T*-1 , you know , * having * to do more with the size of the school , the environment of the school , uh , E_S
90836:182	\[ \[ I , \+ I think 0 I 'd , \] \+ I 'd \] advise a parent *-1 to send a kid to a school *ICH*-2 , though , that *T*-3 has a number of different types of programs , you know , E_S that , uh , some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer *T*-1 , E_S
90856:70	\[ because , \+ um one of the reasons is because , \] you know , the kid does n't know exactly what they want *T*-1 , E_S
90870:11	I see what you 're saying *T*-1 . E_S
90892:14	that 's like what we were saying *T*-1 , though , E_S
90897:14	you know , what 's the trade off *T*-1 there , E_S
90924:61	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the bad part is that most parents or kids do n't know what * to look for *T*-1 . E_S
90949:25	there 's , you know , what will the name recognition , get me *T*-1 , kind of thing . E_S
90979:30	though I would put it on my resume , what program I went to *T*-1 . E_S
90987:20	Um , you know , when I first was applying for graduate schools *T*-1 , I applied to some big programs *ICH*-2 , you know , in this area , like Stevens Institute of Technology , which *T*-3 is recognized *-4 in the Northeast \[ as , \+ as , \] you know , one step below M I T in a sense , you know , E_S
90987:110	Um , you know , when I first was applying for graduate schools *T*-1 , I applied to some big programs *ICH*-2 , you know , in this area , like Stevens Institute of Technology , which *T*-3 is recognized *-4 in the Northeast \[ as , \+ as , \] you know , one step below M I T in a sense , you know , E_S
91001:27	I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor 's *T*-1 , E_S
91003:28	now , I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs *T*-1 , E_S
91010:20	you know , but then when I went , um , for graduate work , you know , or for a new job *T*-1 , people said to me , you know , Shippensburg State ,
91011:4	where is that *T*-1 , you know . E_S
91016:19	And , you know , when I went into higher education *T*-1 , even at other universities , they were n't aware of it , you know . E_S
91030:18	and , uh , um , where was I at *T*-1 ? E_S
91037:99	And , uh , actually , in the Midwest especially , a lot of the schools \[ have , \+ like University of Missouri , will have \] a main campus like Columbia , which *T*-1 is big , multi disciplinary , E_S
91057:101	But , you know , \[ at some of the large schools , \+ I know that \[ \[ at , \+ at , \] \+ at \] University of Maryland \] where I am *T*-1 , you know , in a P H D program , \[ I , \+ I \] have n't even met , uh , someone outside of my area of information systems except for , N_S
91104:4	what books have you read *T*-1 lately ? . E_S
91147:37	because \[ I , \+ I \] right away looked at when it was copyrighted *-1 *T*-4 . Because I could tell by the theme \[ of \+ \] almost when it was written *-2 *T*-3 . E_S
91147:96	because \[ I , \+ I \] right away looked at when it was copyrighted *-1 *T*-4 . Because I could tell by the theme \[ of \+ \] almost when it was written *-2 *T*-3 . E_S
91165:54	That kind of was , um , kind of a pop psychology time for \[ wh- , \+ when \] a lot of books like that were coming out *T*-2 , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
91169:40	And so that makes real sense , that that 's , um , when it was written *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
91190:55	and so I thought hey , I 'll just try this , you know , and see what it was like *T*-1 . E_S
91208:11	You know how that is *T*-1 , E_S
91238:4	when I was \[ on vacation , um , between semester break and summer , \+ you know , on semester break between spring and summer *T*-1 \] N_S
91243:52	I read a book that I \[ have , \+ should have \] read *T*-1 when I was probably in high school *T*-2 . E_S
91270:11	That 's what it was *T*-1 , E_S
91275:50	And , um , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] did n't know what * to expect *T*-1 , except 0 I had heard \[ that , \+ that \] Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist , E_S
91296:10	And then when Jennie had *-1 to read it at Gettysburg *T*-2 \[ and \+ \] \[ I got her the , \+ I got \] her someone , N_S
91342:16	Oh , that 's what I do *T*-1 too . E_S
91445:181	not only \[ am , \+ am \] I \[ re- , \+ reading \] it *-2 to decide whether or not it should be reviewed *-1 , but also , um , because the board of advisers for this , um , journal \[ does n't have , \+ right now does n't have \] a really respected name , um , who *T*-3 's \[ a , \+ uh , a \] scholar \[ on , \+ on \] music , E_S
91455:40	\[ but \+ . But \] at least I , can tell them what I think *T*-1 , E_S
91515:14	Now , translations , what do you mean *T*-1 ,
91537:54	\[ and , \+ and \] that 's \[ right now , \+ right now \] pretty much what I 'm doing *T*-1 as far as , um , N_S
91557:15	There are days when I would \[ be \+ prefer \] , really *-2 doing that *T*-1 . E_S
91625:9	And then where do you meet *T*-1 ? E_S
91687:38	Well , we try *-1 to stay away from those things which *T*-2 might have , uh , salmonella in them . E_S
91696:85	And \[ we are very conscious of , \+ most of us are very conscious \[ of , \+ of , \] \] uh , sanitation aspects , whatever you 've got *T*-1 *-2 to carry for any distance . E_S
91711:25	but there are others in the family who *T*-1 do them better . E_S
91713:47	Do they always have \[ the , \+ the \] one person in the family who \[ * knows , or \+ everyone thinks 0 *T*-4 they know \] how * to make this the best *T*-3 , so that 's what they get *-1 to cook *T*-2 . E_S
91713:93	Do they always have \[ the , \+ the \] one person in the family who \[ * knows , or \+ everyone thinks 0 *T*-4 they know \] how * to make this the best *T*-3 , so that 's what they get *-1 to cook *T*-2 . E_S

91718:37	Well , I had a professor *ICH*-1 in anthropology at school who *T*-2 studied family reunions , E_S
91739:19	so you usually are living where your parents live *T*-1 E_S
91743:7	but when the Protestant ethic happened in America *T*-1 , there were people who *T*-2 ever went out and , you know , went away from the family *-3 to seek their fortune , and then had *-3 to come back home for their reunion , so that , became their version of the pilgrimage . E_S

91752:16	I do n't know how valid it is *T*-1 , E_S
91753:23	but she talked about that and how \[ the , \+ the \] big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together *T*-1 , and , um , you know , about the bread and the ritual placement . E_S
91764:38	the organize \[ the , \+ \] you know , who *T*-1 is going *-2 to see to it that the coffee pot gets there , who *T*-3 's going *-4 to rent the tables , who *T*-5 's going *-6 to see to it that the silverware gets turned *-7 back to the caterer . E_S

91769:29	We have a biographer \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 continues every year *-2 to save clippings on any family member , E_S
91770:78	and they 're entered *-1 into \[ a , \+ a \] wonderful , uh , scrap book . And pictures of new babies and new people who *T*-2 have been added *-3 and , and obituaries to those who *T*-4 are gone . E_S

91790:18	I said , well , how is his nephew doing *T*-1 . E_S
91795:20	I said , `` Well , how 's your brother doing *T*-1 ? '' E_S
91802:41	I said , `` Hey , would n't you like *-1 to know what *T*-2 's happening with these people ? '' E_S
91835:11	It was when , uh , \[ his mother , \+ his step father \] had died the year before *T*-1 , E_S
91854:21	I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 happens when they get scattered *T*-2 , E_S
91854:32	I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 happens when they get scattered *T*-2 , E_S
91865:23	And then the second reunion , people who *T*-1 maybe , you know , had sacrificed things * to come to the first one thought , oh , well , it 's not that big a thing this year , E_S
91877:37	Well , see , \[ we manage , \+ those people who *T*-1 are at that core group manage \] *-2 to \[ keep , \+ keep \] the vigor alive . E_S
91880:16	hey , * guess who *T*-1 got , you know , elected *-2 to the legislature , E_S
91881:13	or * guess who our local sheriff , N_S
91886:4	where have you all been *T*-1 on vacation recently ? E_S
91936:13	Um , usually when we go *T*-1 , we go to Colorado , to Estes Park area . Which *T*-2 is up kind of near Denver . And , uh , stay in the mountains up there , do a little hiking and resting , get away from the Texas heat , that kind of thing . E_S
91936:57	Um , usually when we go *T*-1 , we go to Colorado , to Estes Park area . Which *T*-2 is up kind of near Denver . And , uh , stay in the mountains up there , do a little hiking and resting , get away from the Texas heat , that kind of thing . E_S
91957:23	So that 's probably my favorite place when I have *-1 to go somewhere on a vacation *T*-2 . E_S
91984:28	and they had a little uh , mountain man who *T*-1 came down the river every night , E_S
91987:39	but we were pretty convinced 0 he was a full , hermit who *T*-1 lived up in , the woods , that he 'd come in his little log boat down the river , E_S
92011:35	and I think 0 you 're more receptive *ICH*-5 *ICH*-4 when you 're younger *T*-1 than when you 're older *T*-3 , *-2 to learn new skills , E_S
92011:55	and I think 0 you 're more receptive *ICH*-5 *ICH*-4 when you 're younger *T*-1 than when you 're older *T*-3 , *-2 to learn new skills , E_S
92015:77	and I think 0 \[ they really \+ it really \] \[ pen- , \+ penetrates \] in your memory , you know , what * to do *T*-1 , because you really have a great interest in it . Because it 's something 0 you were n't forced *-2 to do *T*-3 , E_S
92049:90	I mean , \[ there \+ there 's \] a little bit , because there 's some of those English words that you just do n't exactly know what they mean *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
92074:71	and \[ \[ it was , \+ it 's really , \] \+ it 's \] sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are *T*-1 *T*-2 E_S

92075:42	and you can spend a whole day without *-1 talking to anyone , which I thought 0 I would just hate *T*-2 , E_S
92131:31	\[ that 's why , \+ that 's why \] England was nice *T*-1 . E_S
92148:10	twelve days where we 'd just stop like a city a day *T*-1 , E_S
92173:4	What did you wind up with *T*-1 ? . E_S
92186:27	There were some people at the next table who *T*-1 spoke English , E_S
92203:21	I guess 0 that 's why we need *-1 to plan for retirement *T*-3 , so when we do have the free time *T*-2 , we 'll have \[ the , \+ the \] means 0 * to , uh , pursue our dreams *T*-4 . E_S

92259:49	Do you have any that you like *T*-1 well enough that you tape them when you 're not going *-2 to be there *T*-3 ? E_S
92277:16	I do n't know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to ha- , N_S
92307:73	\[ it looks like , \+ it looks like \] it might be one of these seven or eight year run things . Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show *T*-1 . E_S
92327:11	That 's why I 'm surprised 0 I like those two shows *T*-4 , because usually I like , you know , stuff that *T*-1 just ends sort of , that \[ you just , \+ you \] do n't have *-2 to , have watched *T*-3 , you know . E_S
92343:4	which they do *T*-1 at the beginning of the season , *-2 to grab your attention . You know , E_S
92367:9	oh , what 's that one with Burt Reynolds *T*-1 ? E_S
92368:35	That type of show is \[ what we \+ what , uh , we \] watch *T*-1 . E_S
92391:6	And what night is it on *T*-1 ? E_S
92398:83	the first one 0 we saw *T*-1 , um , \[ they were , \+ \[ it , \+ it \] involved \] a tradition of when a \[ per- , \+ person \] reaches seventy-five *T*-2 , E_S

92400:51	\[ but , \+ but , \] uh , the son-in-laws get *-1 to throw the mother-in-laws when they 're seventy five *T*-2 over a cliff . E_S

92438:60	And then we saw one \[ \[ where this , \+ there was a teenage , \] \+ when a teenage \] boy comes into his manhood *T*-1 , E_S
92493:7	But what I 've read *T*-1 about it , they talk about that . E_S
92501:80	but my husband likes *-1 to watch , um , old movies , especially war movies , \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , sports , which I 'm not , E_S

92865:36	Well , see , \[ this , \+ this \] is what *T*-1 concerns me . E_S
92884:15	I mean , what we throw *T*-1 away \[ is , \+ is \] a ransom , a king 's , ransom to most people , E_S
92892:27	and even to people in our country , who *T*-1 scavenge for food E_S
92914:50	\[ This is , \+ uh , \[ I , \+ this is \] \] why I thought 0 Jimmy Carter was never \[ very po- , \+ very pos- *T*-1 , \] N_S

92963:20	and they use styrofoam plates , when they would n't , need *-1 to use styrofoam plates *T*-2 . E_S
92991:48	Well , I think 0 \[ that may , \+ that 's kind of what it 's \] coming to *T*-1 , I 'm sure 0 *T*-2 . E_S
93006:38	with the mind set of the American public , I think 0 what they will do *T*-1 is * start *-5 paying Mexico to take our trash . \[ That *T*-2 is n't , \+ that *T*-3 is n't \] harmful . E_S

93132:9	Well , what do you do *T*-1 on a cruise ? E_S
93150:10	And then when the ship docks *T*-1 , you get *-2 to go *-3 sight-seeing and shopping . E_S
93157:6	And where have you been *T*-1 on these cruises ? E_S
93166:36	And then we went to , uh , the western Caribbean , which *T*-1 is , uh , Port , uh , Cancun , Cozumel , and Ocho Rios . E_S
93182:4	Where are you from *T*-1 originally ? E_S
93254:4	What 's the best part *T*-1 , from your point of view ? E_S
93276:16	Oh , that 's what everybody says *T*-1 , E_S
93309:4	How long are the cruises *T*-1 ? E_S
93324:15	I think 0 when we went to England and France *T*-1 , we were there ten , twelve days , E_S
93329:17	\[ when , \+ when \] I spend enough money * to go overseas *T*-1 , N_S I , go for a long time . E_S

93369:34	They live in a small town called * David , which *T*-1 is northern Panama up near Costa Rica . E_S
93429:47	and then with my wife I actually go to the gym and lift weights , which *T*-1 is n't , I understand , quite exercising , E_S
93449:34	and , um , I play softball once a week , which *T*-1 is kind of more recreation than exercise . E_S
93487:25	So , I 'm thirty-two years old which *T*-1 is probably different than yourself E_S
93548:22	I get *-1 to share whatever I did *T*-2 with my wife , \[ and , \+ and \] vice versa . E_S

93563:84	so , running , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] at that point which you probably get to *T*-1 after about six months of dedicated running where you do n't feel your muscles any more *T*-2 E_S
93573:42	During those first few months you have *-1 to think about running and why your elbow hurts *T*-2 and why you ca n't breathe *T*-3 and this and that , E_S

93605:80	\[ so , \+ so \] I guess 0 that aspect of that takes away the work \[ the , \+ \] with my wife , which *T*-1 is nice , E_S

93660:52	I 'll do those once in a while just you know , like at eleven thirty when Love Connection 's on *T*-1 and I ca n't sleep , E_S
93692:5	When your life becomes sedentary *T*-1 is when you have *-2 to make yourself a plan *T*-3 , E_S
93692:27	When your life becomes sedentary *T*-1 is when you have *-2 to make yourself a plan *T*-3 , E_S
93696:7	and what *T*-1 's real funny about plans is that there 's a struggle \[ between , \+ \] uh , \[ \[ when you , \+ when you add something to your life *T*-2 , \] \+ when you add a plan to your life *T*-3 , \] E_S

93723:19	That 'll come some day when I , N_S
93786:5	what else did I serve *T*-1 with that . E_S
93817:38	and they say , gosh , if you have company coming when you do n't want *-1 to be always in the kitchen *T*-2 , it 's easy , E_S

93880:7	and what you do *T*-1 *-2 to make it , you take the shell
93886:4	what *T*-1 's next , E_S
93911:8	Usually when we get avocados *T*-3 my kids just like *-1 to eat them *-2 plain E_S
93935:4	What you want *T*-1 . E_S
93936:16	\[ wh- , \+ where \] do they get it *T*-1 ? . E_S
93942:35	I guess 0 they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant *T*-1 maybe . E_S
93946:104	\[ I thought , \+ oh , *-2 \[ taking this , \+ you know , taking this \] as a dip , I thought , \] gosh , you know , sometimes when we have it at home *T*-1 it , it turns dark on the top so quickly , E_S

94111:48	I 'm sure 0 location 's really important as far as * figuring out where one ought *-2 to be *T*-1 . E_S
94116:16	We have factions , when it 's one part *T*-1 , E_S
94158:5	How many people , Jim , *T*-1 are involved ? E_S
94177:10	So sometimes when these other families get together *T*-1 , they 're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids , E_S
94236:35	so \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] fun when we go to that one *T*-1 . E_S
94260:23	But then we have the same attitude when it 's out , there *T*-1 , although this year we 're going out . E_S
94279:12	We discovered how much work it *EXP*-4 is *T*-1 * just to organize *RNR*-2 and get *RNR*-2 *ICH*-3 it together .
94399:4	what do you think 0 *T*-1 is the biggest problem ? E_S
94407:107	to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know , because , I mean , the general values that we 're teaching *T*-1 kind of conflict with what we expect *T*-2 out of people in school , I mean , E_S
94435:93	you 're going *-2 to \[ \[ carry , \+ carry with , \] \+ carry to \] school , uh , out into the world , you know , what you learned *T*-1 at home , E_S
94453:66	but , uh , I just remember *-1 seeing on the news the other night , 0 they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better *T*-2 E_S
94458:15	and not so much when I was growing up *T*-1 , E_S Catholic schools are generally considered *-1 a little bit easier than the public schools , E_S
94471:26	you look at the schools like that where you 've got a lot of kids \[ who *T*-1 are basically , \+ uh , that *T*-2 might be \] more \[ well to- , \+ well off , \] you know , going to a private Catholic school or whatever *T*-3 , uh , E_S
94486:44	like you said , you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you 're pressured *-1 not to learn *T*-2 in instance , E_S
94501:25	and \[ what do you , \+ what would you do *T*-1 \] *-2 to fix the school systems ? E_S
94503:23	Uh , that 's a tough question how * to fix the school system *T*-1 . E_S
94519:11	That 's what I was going *-1 to say *T*-2 . E_S
94528:22	They 're even in grade school when they do that *T*-1 . E_S
94529:21	But I ca n't remember exactly what *T*-1 goes through their head when they 're doing that *T*-2 . E_S
94529:40	But I ca n't remember exactly what *T*-1 goes through their head when they 're doing that *T*-2 . E_S
94534:11	that 's why I say , 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a tough question what would you do *T*-3 *T*-1 , E_S
94534:60	that 's why I say , 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a tough question what would you do *T*-3 *T*-1 , E_S
94535:88	because , you know , even * trying *-1 to instill those values is kind of hard \[ \[ when , \+ uh , when , \] \+ when \] you 're growing up \[ in , \+ you know , in \] a home which *T*-2 may be , uh , just the pits *T*-3 , E_S

94537:100	it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard * to say , well , you need *-2 to take care of other people 's stuff as well , \[ when you 're , \+ when you barely have \] anything yourself *T*-3 . E_S
94542:14	I could see where that would be a problem *T*-1 , E_S
94569:61	and , um , \[ about , \+ I guess 0 about \] \[ when the first , \+ when the youngest \] one was in kindergarten *T*-2 I started *-1 working at a preschool and , uh , you know , doing some work , E_S

94659:72	and I was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things , and was visiting with another mother who *T*-1 was there with her children , E_S

94682:44	that *T*-2 maybe have another salary in their family \[ that , \+ where they can do that *T*-1 , \] E_S
94686:13	and that 's what I had the opportunity of , you know , * doing *T*-1 E_S
94708:4	which *T*-1 is , N_S
94771:60	I need *-1 to be involved in their school , because I want *-2 to be the one who *T*-3 influences the way 0 they develop *T*-4 . E_S
94786:37	\[ I , \+ I \] felt like that anybody who *T*-1 cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them and hold them . E_S

94825:7	and when he started , uh , at Skyline High School *T*-2 , I asked him , Son , \[ when , \+ uh , you know , where \] do I go *-1 to sign up for the P T A *T*-3 ? E_S

94897:31	and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were *-1 to be taken *-2 to the Y and taught *-2 *-2 to swim which *T*-3 just pleased me to death because I 've always \[ been , ha- , \+ you know , been afraid \] of the water *T*-4 E_S

94971:4	What brand are they *T*-1 ? E_S
94989:33	MUMBLEx we decided *-1 not to get the MUMBLEx which *T*-2 is actually another loaner one *ICH*-5 too that we picked *T*-3 up for a consulting job that my husband was doing *T*-4 , E_S

95040:35	We use it more for just * writing programs when we need *-2 to *?* *T*-1 or , um , doing research , looking at the speech signal and then doing writing , and also \[ as a \+ just as a \] terminal , E_S
95060:21	\[ I got , \+ when I got \] mine *T*-1 I had an internal modem in it E_S

95090:16	\[ Where , \+ Where \] are you *T*-1 , N_S
95107:24	So it *EXP*-3 'll be interesting how much of it *T*-1 actually gets picked *-2 up . E_S
95112:4	What time is it *T*-2 now where you are *T*-1 ? E_S
95112:22	What time is it *T*-2 now where you are *T*-1 ? E_S

95128:20	Uh , I know someone who *T*-1 has *?* , E_S
95138:79	You can save a lot of money , too . Certainly cut down on long distance charges \[ if you , \+ if that 's what you \] have *T*-1 in mind . E_S

95236:56	Um , I also , uh , handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who *T*-1 need *-2 to find out something connected * , E_S
95238:4	What do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S
95241:33	they 're already doing it in the armed forces , where they handle weapons and so forth *T*-1 ,
95252:49	\[ I , \+ I \] especially agree that if it 's an area where they could cause somebody else , you know harm or injury *T*-1 , absolutely . E_S
95258:37	but I do a little bit \[ where it , \+ where it \] would n't hurt anybody *T*-1 . E_S
95348:29	so I 've already been tested *-1 once when I was hired *-2 *T*-3 \[ and , \+ and \] once since they initiated this random testing program . E_S
95353:22	But I work with one girl who *T*-1 was tested *-2 ,

95379:34	You know , so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel *T*-1 , E_S
95382:33	Either just the lucky or the unlucky one , depending on how you look at it *T*-1 . E_S
95419:17	I do n't know what kind of work you do *T*-1 , E_S
95420:46	but \[ there , \+ there \] would be , even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that *T*-1 was that way *T*-2 . E_S
95423:43	\[ we have , \+ we have \] a lot of people who *T*-1 work on the line . E_S
95440:205	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] just think 0 employers have *-1 to have , \+ * especially given today , the drug abuse that *T*-2 goes on , I just think 0 employers have *-3 to have \] some kind of way 0 * to see that they 're not being put *-7 at risk *T*-6 .

95455:54	so \[ it , \+ I mean , it \] protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that *T*-1 . E_S
95460:28	there was a court case , uh , here where I live *T*-2 , just a few months ago . E_S
95476:78	So I 'm curious especially since T I -s a local , you know , employer is also already doing it , * seeing what they 'll say *T*-1 about it especially since , N_S
95478:14	* To see how that 's , N_S
95491:66	You know , \[ we 've never , \+ my husband and I have never \] been in a situation where somebody said you have *-1 to be drug tested *-2 *T*-3 . E_S
95503:59	and so , \[ \[ we , \+ we , \] \+ in our minds we 're \] thinking what 's the big deal *T*-1 . E_S
95511:16	and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much *T*-1 whether they 're really concerned about their rights , or whether they 're really concerned about something else . E_S
95522:82	and , of course , \[ the big deal , \+ one of the big deals \] now , too , is \[ to , \+ \] that when you , come into a company *T*-2 , \[ as \+ \] you sign a paper saying that I will go *-1 take a , N_S
95530:11	my father who *T*-1 is very old has kept one his entire life , E_S
95545:22	and my husband started graduate school , when we were first married *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
95548:83	it 's more just \[ \[ a , \+ a pretty , \] \+ uh , a fairly , \] uh , accurate , uh , recording of what I spend *T*-1 , and what I think 0 I am going *-2 to have *-3 to spend *T*-4 . E_S

95566:22	I just , uh , spent whatever *T*-1 came in \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , \[ didn- , \+ never knew \] what *T*-2 came in and what *T*-3 went out . But , uh , \[ just , you know , like , \+ about like \] the government runs . E_S
95566:81	I just , uh , spent whatever *T*-1 came in \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , \[ didn- , \+ never knew \] what *T*-2 came in and what *T*-3 went out . But , uh , \[ just , you know , like , \+ about like \] the government runs . E_S

95578:76	but my dad was so precise , that , I mean , if it said * to spend eleven percent on something that 's what *T*-1 it was spent *-2 . E_S
95602:35	and it *EXP*-1 's real fun * to just see how things have changed *T*-2 over the years . Uh , E_S
95630:71	And she came upon \[ a , \+ a \] budget book that she had *T*-1 back in the thirties . Uh , when they , N_S
95636:41	And , it *EXP*-1 was just , uh , fascinating * to see how little things cost *T*-2 , E_S
95652:73	I found a record that I had *T*-1 , uh , I travel in Europe a lot and \[ I , \+ what I \] had paid *T*-2 for hotels . E_S
95672:31	Oh . But , of course , it 's just what the market will bear *T*-1 . E_S
95676:26	If people will pay two hundred then why * charge ten *T*-1 . E_S
95706:22	Well , then you never know how they will , N_S
95708:16	they may flip flop when they , get *-1 to be , uh , \[ \[ ol- , \+ we- , \] \+ older *T*-2 . \] E_S

95735:75	I was putting money aside \[ and \+ \] \[ when , \+ before \] I was married *-1 , you know , when I was working out of college *T*-2 E_S

95818:4	which you learn *T*-1 , N_S
95833:58	And I , think that that 's the way that we looked at it *T*-1 in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school *T*-2 that there was a light at the end of that tunnel . You know , \[ that \+ that \] it *EXP*-3 was worth it * to save and to not have , uh , something and , uh , in return know that something better was going *-4 to be at the end of it E_S
95891:4	what is your last name *T*-1 ? E_S
95911:17	that 's the guy who *T*-1 hired me , E_S
95934:87	\[ as far as , \+ \] \[ maybe , \+ maybe \] as the summer heat comes along I would sort of like *-1 going somewhere where it 's not so hot *T*-2 . And being able *-3 to be outside , enjoy \[ outsor- , \+ outside \] activities , E_S
95947:16	\[ Where , \+ where \] do you usually go *T*-1 ? E_S
95966:64	there 's a \[ nice , \+ nice \] train ride that *T*-1 goes up to the city of Silverton where they used *-2 to do a lot of silver mining *T*-3 . E_S
95982:46	we are going *-1 to go to , uh , Destin , Florida , which *T*-2 is a very nice beach area , if you are not familiar with it . E_S
96029:21	Uh , I do not know why it is *T*-1 , E_S
96038:9	Oh , where do you stay *T*-1 ? E_S
96043:72	and it 's , uh , called *-1 that because it 's at the very end of , uh , a jetty there , which *T*-2 is , uh , sort of at the end of this \[ little , \+ little \] point E_S
96053:92	And , uh , \[ they have a , \+ we have a , \] uh , I think 0 it 's three bedroom or two bedroom , uh , condominium , which *T*-1 will sleep , I do not know , quite a few about , six or eight . And , uh , cause it 's got , you know , pull out couches and all that , E_S
96124:25	Uh , \[ what does , \+ what does \] that mean *T*-1 , alternate ? E_S
96127:5	what it truly is supposed *-1 to mean *T*-2 is nine weeks of school , three weeks of vacation , nine weeks of school , three weeks of vacation . E_S
96152:63	\[ so , \+ anyway , so \] \[ maybe , \+ maybe \] within a year , we will see how that falls *T*-1 . E_S
96176:26	Well , uh , \[ ho- , \+ how \] do you view this whole subject *T*-1 ? E_S
96179:21	Are you , uh , one who *T*-1 feels like you \[ have , \+ have \] benefited from the change \[ in , \+ in \] roles in women ? E_S
96180:20	\[ Or , \+ or \] what do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
96199:37	\[ Are you , \+ uh , are you \] someone who *T*-1 works outside your home , E_S
96219:41	Uh , I guess 0 there 's more women in , uh , what *T*-1 would be classified *-2 as a man 's job . E_S
96223:17	\[ What , \+ what \] kind of work do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
96268:23	And I was a math major , which *T*-1 was a real rarity , among women at that time . E_S
96275:31	So , I was in a lot of classes where , uh , \[ there , \+ I \] was either the only girl or , you know , one of just a very , few women in the class *T*-1 . E_S
96326:53	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 we have come a long way , actually , when I think about , you know , when things were like even , \[ when I , \+ you know , just when I \] was in high school *T*-4 *T*-3 , and how it is *T*-1 now for girls *T*-2 . E_S
96326:80	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 we have come a long way , actually , when I think about , you know , when things were like even , \[ when I , \+ you know , just when I \] was in high school *T*-4 *T*-3 , and how it is *T*-1 now for girls *T*-2 . E_S

96367:66	In fact , I have a daughter \[ who *T*-1 is in \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ who *T*-2 just graduated in \] civil engineering , from college . E_S
96394:49	so , that is recognized *-2 , as , uh , you know , a place where women should be *T*-1 . E_S
96403:88	\[ I , \+ you \] see it \[ \[ in , \+ uh , also in , \] \+ uh , like in \] church , uh , where more and more women are becoming ministers . \[ In , \+ uh , you know , in \] protestant congregations *T*-1 E_S
96410:66	\[ I do- , \+ I do \] not know if you are Roman Catholic or , you know , what *ICH*-2 you know *T*-1 about that . E_S
96432:36	So , uh , uh , \[ how about , \+ what \] in particular would you think \[ that , uh , women still , \+ other than the work place , where women still \] are being , uh , oh , you know , MUMBLEx found *-1 wanting , you know , or not \[ re- , \+ as highly *ICH*-2 regarded *-1 \] as men would be *?* *-4 *T*-3 .
96440:67	\[ \[ what do you think that , \+ what do you think *T*-1 , \] \+ * tell me what you think *T*-2 \] about this . E_S

96471:46	I do not know if he was a general or , you know , what his rank was *T*-1 ,
96477:64	I mean , \[ I can not be real , \+ you know I can not tell \] you why I feel this way *T*-1 , E_S
96486:109	You know , \[ Neil , \+ well Neil \] as far as I am concerned *-1 , and MUMBLEx I could be wrong about this , \[ but \+ \] the only one area where a woman could not do it *T*-2 is if she just physically did not have the strength , * to do something . E_S
96515:30	but I am sure that there are women who *T*-1 \[ would , \+ would \] relish that , you know , kind of job . E_S
96534:18	*-2 having a daughter who *T*-1 has gone \[ into this , \+ into engineering , \] I sort of watched progress *-2 to see if she did anything differently than I did . E_S

96779:58	and \[ I am , \+ I am \] glad that I am able *-1 to do what I want *-2 to do *T*-3 right now . E_S
96883:17	I do not know what the healing process would be *T*-2 or what *T*-1 was causing the problem , E_S
96883:40	I do not know what the healing process would be *T*-2 or what *T*-1 was causing the problem , E_S
96937:19	uh , well that 's how society has changed *T*-1 , uh , you know , uh , E_S
96976:42	If you do not have the time *-1 to talk to yourself , who are you going *-2 to talk to *T*-3 . E_S
97001:17	You are finding out who you are *T*-1 . E_S
97003:34	But is not that difficult 0 * to do *T*-1 when you are working full time and have *-2 to come home and prepare a meal and , get homework done *-3 *T*-4 , E_S
97007:18	and , you know , where do you find the time *T*-1 . E_S
97014:37	And I was always very careful *-1 to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help *T*-2 , E_S
97018:20	I helped them with exactly what they asked for *T*-1 E_S
97050:16	They do not know how *-1 to think for themselves and be responsible , for themselves *T*-2 . E_S
97054:16	I do not know why God made women brilliant *T*-1 . E_S
97061:38	they tend *-1 to look at the mother as the one who *T*-2 solves all problems . E_S
97069:61	\[ I , \+ as a matter of fact I \] was talking to a friend *ICH*-2 yesterday , who *T*-1 said 0 she has a new policy in her home E_S

97108:21	we are talking about mediators who *T*-1 get involved *-2 in family crises , parents and children , husbands and wives , uh , you know , boss and employee . Those kinds of things . Interpersonal mediation , E_S
97122:7	so what were you saying *T*-1 ? E_S
97124:43	\[ Do you work with , \+ do you work around \] children when you work *T*-1 ? E_S
97150:4	What is child care like *T*-1 in New York ? E_S
97151:4	What is , N_S
97208:33	I think 0 it does \[ when , \+ when \] they are real little *T*-1 E_S
97235:39	But , uh , I just think that , you know , when there 's two year olds running around *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ \[ whoever *T*-2 is taking care of , \+ the care givers \] \] are going *-3 to pay attention to the two year olds . E_S
97239:10	And only when the infant screams *T*-1 , are they going *-2 to go there , E_S
97262:14	Our oldest grandson , when he was eighteen months old *T*-1 went into \[ a , \+ a \] Montessori , day care system . E_S
97269:29	and there 's times of day that even when the child is awake *T*-1 \[ that they , \+ that they \] lay quietly and look at certain things E_S
97288:55	well \[ she 's , \+ she 's \] just been doing all kinds of stuff where she 's , you know MUMBLEx , N_S
97290:4	How old is she *T*-1 ? E_S
97309:73	And \[ I think that , \+ you know , I think \] 0 child care for infants is much harder than when they are older *T*-1 , E_S
97320:24	It is *?* because that 's when they are clinging to mama *T*-1 , E_S
97325:55	I think 0 \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 \] hurts the parents * to leave when the child is crying *T*-2 , E_S
97332:39	We are just going *-1 to have , *-2 to see how things work out *T*-3 . E_S
97360:31	\[ it would , \+ if they were where I could not get my hands on them *T*-1 , I am afraid 0 I would \] probably go crazy . E_S
97379:120	And \[ you need *-1 to look at , when you , \+ if you do decide *-2 to go with child care , you really need *-4 \[ to , \+ to \] \] look at what your options are *T*-3 \[ and , \+ and \] look at \[ the , \+ what they \] offer *T*-5 , E_S

97417:22	it will be a little rough when she is a very , very little infant *T*-1 , E_S
97422:10	but like when she is a month or so *T*-1 , my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with baby-sitting for large families . E_S
97427:82	and we \[ cou- , \+ might \] even be able *-1 to do it on a trade off basis .

Uh , and not be bothered *T*-5 , E_S
97445:32	And so we will just have *-1 to see how things work out *T*-2 . E_S
97446:106	But \[ I think 0 the whole , \+ you know , ideally I think , \] uh , 0 business should have the , day care centers there , whether it 's the parents who *T*-1 take turns *-2 watching the kids , or whether E_S
97460:75	and * \[ have , \+ have \] some kind of real good program , set *-1 up so that \[ you , \+ when you \] go *T*-2 you can be assured that if there 's an emergency that person in charge knows C P R or first aid E_S
97479:29	\[ They , \+ they \] adjust to what the parents MUMBLEx . N_S
97495:18	I have another friend whose brother and his wife *T*-1 have done this , E_S
97508:43	My , uh , mother was divorced *-1 in nineteen , uh , fifty-seven , when I was seven years old *T*-2 . E_S
97536:5	What *T*-1 was wrong with her , was 0 she not attractive enough ,
97608:127	Uh , for instance , uh , well , you know , I am just not taken *-1 as seriously *ICH*-4 , you know , at professions , \[ as many of the wom- , \+ as many of the men \] who *T*-3 are doing the same job 0 I do *T*-2 . E_S
97620:94	So \[ \[ I am pretty , \+ I am \[ pretty ob- , \+ pretty \] \] cons- , \+ I mean , I am pretty aware \] of what *T*-1 goes on uh , in the church . E_S
97674:34	I have never been able *-2 to figure out why they can not ever change *T*-1 , why they can not bend *T*-3 . I mean , why they can not just accept , you know , competent women *T*-4 , E_S

97706:25	Uh , and \[ I , \+ what I \] would like *-1 to see *T*-3 happen futuristically , is what we are discussing *T*-2 , is that yes , uh , we each have our , uh , jobs in life , and that we should recognize that . And that we should support each other . E_S

97739:40	I am married *-1 to a wonderful man , you know , who *T*-2 treats me \[ very , \+ \] you know , \[ with a , \+ with as , \] N_S
97744:9	But , when he gets angry *T*-1 , it 's always over control issues ,
97754:41	even if they want *-1 to *?* , they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss *T*-2 . E_S
97761:19	And , uh , the women when they are married *-1 *T*-2 , they are *-3 to be subjective to their husbands . E_S
97769:56	\[ And , \+ uh , but \] I think that they should be in harmony with what they are *T*-1 , with what the subject matter is *T*-2 . E_S
97769:75	\[ And , \+ uh , but \] I think that they should be in harmony with what they are *T*-1 , with what the subject matter is *T*-2 . E_S
97823:9	Well , what movies have you seen *T*-1 recently , Valerie ? E_S
97841:4	How was that *T*-1 ? E_S
97858:4	How long did that movie run *T*-1 ? E_S
97877:24	That always seems *-1 to happen when you rent them *T*-2 , you know . E_S
97894:9	uh , who was the *T*-1 , N_S
97967:4	What ages are they *T*-1 ? E_S
98025:8	and , how does the story line go *T*-1 ? E_S
98034:40	but , course , it 's one of these with a twist where it looks like he 's the one that *T*-1 wound up *-2 killing her *T*-3 E_S
98074:4	what *T*-1 was N_S
98085:24	so you know all the story and who *T*-1 did what and when it happened *T*-2 , E_S
98085:40	so you know all the story and who *T*-1 did what and when it happened *T*-2 , E_S
98117:28	but we like BILL AND TED 'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE which *T*-1 is another funny one . E_S
98172:35	Well , Hal , \[ what 's , \+ uh , what 's \] crime like *T*-1 in Dallas ? E_S
98174:18	Well , it depends where in Dallas you are *T*-1 . E_S
98187:26	and there are parts of town here where , when they talk about the nightly gunfire *T*-1 . N_S
98212:36	\[ \[ That , \+ uh , the , \] \+ what they call *T*-1 the \] latchkey children . E_S

98257:16	\[ What , \+ what \] do you think 0 *T*-1 can prevent crime ? E_S
98260:23	it 's one of those things where , if you 're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on N_S

98268:13	but that 's which *T*-1 came first . E_S
98277:43	and , well , uh , since now I 'm in my mid-forties , when I was in grad school *T*-1 or when I was an undergraduate *T*-2 * growing up in a more rural area I thought 0 , you know , crime \[ was , \+ was \] reasonably unknown and just the situation that *T*-3 's developed *-4 with \[ the , \+ the \] drug aspect of , uh uh , the pushers , the dealers and the addicts , uh , E_S

98298:49	But I think , you know , that there is a lot in the society where things have changed *T*-1 , E_S
98332:4	What *T*-1 happens if we lose worse . E_S
98341:18	they let this person who *T*-1 had ruined it uh , \[ become , \+ well , die \] or whatever . E_S
98361:103	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] would certainly like *-1 to see a real test \[ of , \+ of \] * making drugs real cheap * to see if when you make them available *T*-2 people then do n't use them . E_S
98412:43	but nowadays , there 's so much on TV \[ where , \+ where \] people seem *-1 to have the idea 0 they can get something for nothing *T*-2 . E_S
98436:74	In this country , and for example with alcohol or with drugs \[ is , \+ \] we do n't seem *-1 to understand how * to handle it as a society to say \[ okay , \+ it is okay \] under these circumstances , but if you step outside these bounds , the punishment is extreme *T*-2 .
98448:29	my father was hit *-1 by a drunk driver when I was in high school *T*-2 E_S
98483:20	But , that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving was , uh , misplaced *-1 for years *T*-2 E_S
98503:20	\[ What are , \+ what does \] your city have *T*-1 for gun control if anything ? E_S
98513:125	and \[ I , \+ I \] look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense \[ of , \+ of \] the value of , and worth , so that they have real problems when it comes to , uh , uh *T*-1 , N_S
98518:15	uh , but then when you quantify things *T*-3 and \[ that \+ \] might also hold criminal trials for how many years *T*-1 is appropriate , uh , that they might leave it to somebody else who , uh , *T*-2 has expertise in that . E_S
98518:65	uh , but then when you quantify things *T*-3 and \[ that \+ \] might also hold criminal trials for how many years *T*-1 is appropriate , uh , that they might leave it to somebody else who , uh , *T*-2 has expertise in that . E_S

98524:128	or even a panel \[ of , \+ of \] lawyers \[ if , \+ if \] it got to that point . Might be better \[ at \+ \] than just regular civil people . Not knowing , you know , exactly what things are *T*-1 , \[ from , \+ from \] murder on up to like tax stuff , you know . E_S
98534:108	and one thing that you get *T*-2 if you have some expertise is , uh , you know the range \[ of , \+ of \] possible values or terms or , you know , how heinous was the crime *T*-1 . E_S
98539:5	when I only do something one , two or three times *T*-1 I 'm hardly an expert on it , E_S
98545:9	And so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was \[ a , \+ \] you know , worth five years or twenty-five *T*-1 . E_S
98551:93	some people just sit on them once in their lifetime , you know , if they 're that lucky sometimes . Or , you know , \[ what , \+ whatever \] the case may be *T*-1 . \[ And , \+ and \] may not have any idea of \[ what , \+ what \] the standard punishment *ICH*-2 would be *T*-3 for it . E_S

98560:28	Or not long enough or , you know , whatever the case may be *T*-2 . E_S
98568:160	The only thing 0 I worry about *T*-1 sometimes is \[ if , \+ if \] you get somebody *ICH*-5 *ICH*-6 in there \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 has a name , that *T*-3 is the defendant and , you know , sometimes , might have more pull , which \[ *T*-4 that \+ \] does happen . E_S
98574:41	People can be paid *-2 off \[ or \+ \] politically or whatever the case may be *T*-1 E_S

98599:28	\[ Well , \+ well , \] also what I do n't think 0 *T*-1 is fair , either , is when you have \[ like a , \+ say a \] rapist , come in *T*-2 , E_S

98612:53	but , to me , when you do the crime *T*-1 , then you should pay for whatever you did *T*-2 , E_S
98621:16	Well , that 's where , uh , the role of juries \[ is , \+ is \] restricted *-1 *T*-2 E_S
98638:11	It 's what information *T*-1 is presented *-2 E_S
98640:50	but often juries hear only a fraction \[ of the , \+ of the \] story when they have *-1 to decide guilt or innocence *T*-2 . E_S

98666:19	because stories look very different when you hear different parts \[ of the , \+ of the \] truth *T*-1 . E_S

98712:49	Well , What I wear *T*-1 sometimes depends \[ on , \+ on \] how cold I think 0 the school might be *T*-2 or what room I might be in *T*-3 since I 'm a sub , and have different rooms 0 * to go to *T*-4 . And always carry a sweater . E_S
98712:82	Well , What I wear *T*-1 sometimes depends \[ on , \+ on \] how cold I think 0 the school might be *T*-2 or what room I might be in *T*-3 since I 'm a sub , and have different rooms 0 * to go to *T*-4 . And always carry a sweater . E_S
98733:49	And \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] interesting * to notice when you go to different schools *T*-2 that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual , uh , N_S
98762:24	And one might be a hat day where you have *-1 to come up with some sort of hat *T*-2 . E_S
98764:28	And you never know that , though sometimes when you 're going in *T*-1 , do you ? E_S
98790:31	so you 're aware *ICH*-2 ahead of time of what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
98832:40	And they 'll just wear your common , ordinary , you know , whatever you \[ might \+ might \] say *T*-2 , E_S
98848:53	course , it 's a standing joke , you know , \[ when the , \+ when the \] men come \[ in \+ in \] \[ a , \+ a \] tie and a suit coat *T*-1 , you say , you know , what , have you got a job interview today E_S
98858:33	and \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know how a coach *ICH*-4 would feel \[ if , \+ \] that *T*-1 teaches health or \[ Eng- , \+ you know , English , \] or whatever *T*-3 that they had *-2 to wear a tie . E_S
98886:21	Well , see , that 's what I would think *T*-1 . E_S
98890:11	That 's what I would think *T*-1 . E_S
98929:44	but even there 's a couple public schools in Dallas \[ where , \+ where \] the kids wear uniforms *T*-1 and the teachers , you know , dress in accordance with that *T*-1 . E_S
98944:30	And , of course , the kids say , then why * bother *T*-2 ,
98945:21	* just let me wear what I want *T*-1 . E_S
99003:6	And where did you go *T*-1 ? E_S
99012:27	but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when I graduated *T*-1 and , uh , were looking for a southern school
99025:4	Where do you live now *T*-1 ? E_S
99028:4	Where are you *T*-1 ? E_S
99065:57	And , uh , you know , *-1 having gone to the University of Minnesota , I know what a big university is like *T*-2 . E_S
99066:41	And , uh , one thing that I did *T*-1 this summer , which I thought 0 *T*-2 might benefit both my daughters is , 0 my youngest daughter got involved *-3 in band , E_S
99074:39	And I thought 0 this would expose both of them to what it 's , you know , like *T*-1 on a \[ coll- , \+ a smaller college \] campus . E_S
99081:4	what were your selection criteria *T*-1 . E_S
99082:20	Did you base it on what you wanted *-1 to major in *T*-2 or what you would feel comfortable with *T*-3 or what you could afford *T*-4 E_S
99082:49	Did you base it on what you wanted *-1 to major in *T*-2 or what you would feel comfortable with *T*-3 or what you could afford *T*-4 E_S
99082:74	Did you base it on what you wanted *-1 to major in *T*-2 or what you would feel comfortable with *T*-3 or what you could afford *T*-4 E_S
99089:5	when I say small *T*-1 , my graduating class had eighteen in it . E_S
99143:22	because I had so many friends who *T*-1 did go from our small school to University of Michigan , which *T*-2 was so large E_S
99143:62	because I had so many friends who *T*-1 did go from our small school to University of Michigan , which *T*-2 was so large E_S
99157:86	That was the one and only thing 0 I could really afford *T*-1 other than \[ a jun- , \+ you know , a junior \] college , which I did n't want *-2 to do *T*-3 . E_S
99158:13	So that 's how , you know , my decision was made *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
99169:7	and when you mentioned that *T*-1 , \[ we , \+ we \] have friends who *T*-2 have children *ICH*-4 there who *T*-3 just love it . E_S
99169:51	and when you mentioned that *T*-1 , \[ we , \+ we \] have friends who *T*-2 have children *ICH*-4 there who *T*-3 just love it . E_S
99169:72	and when you mentioned that *T*-1 , \[ we , \+ we \] have friends who *T*-2 have children *ICH*-4 there who *T*-3 just love it . E_S
99178:16	\[ What , \+ what \] does , N_S
99182:21	he thinks 0 that 's what he 'd like *-1 to do *T*-2 , E_S
99188:15	Does your daughter know what she 'd like *-1 to do *T*-2 ? E_S
99194:10	Uh , what she talks about *T*-1 a lot is theater which I think 0 *T*-2 is , N_S
99194:39	Uh , what she talks about *T*-1 a lot is theater which I think 0 *T*-2 is , N_S
99204:77	And I 'm , you know , showing them 0 if you 're strong in math and science , kiddos , this is one area where women can make some decent money *T*-1 . You know . E_S
99218:57	Well , it sounds like he 's got some really , you know , good strong ideas of what he wants *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
99260:27	and it was trying *-1 to rain which *T*-2 seems strange * to have it raining in July . E_S
99264:63	Normally we do n't have too much , uh , humidity \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , rainy time when it 's past June *T*-1 . E_S
99270:29	You get those great big cracks in the ground where it 's been so dry *T*-1 E_S
99289:34	and \[ I , \+ you \] sort of forget how much it did rain *T*-1 E_S
99300:27	and , you know , so many times when you were trying *-1 to schedule outdoor activities *T*-2 , you just never knew if it was going *-3 to be a go or not because of the weather . E_S
99311:19	You could pretty much do whatever you wanted *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
99315:5	What part of Michigan were you living in *T*-1 ? E_S
99317:26	Oh , I grew up in Dearborn which *T*-1 is a suburb \[ of , \+ of \] Detroit . E_S
99325:14	You probably know where that is *T*-1 because I know where Pontiac is *T*-2 , E_S
99325:38	You probably know where that is *T*-1 because I know where Pontiac is *T*-2 , E_S
99331:4	What *T*-1 brought you down here ? E_S
99357:20	and , uh , that 's how it worked out *T*-1 . E_S
99374:15	but you know where all the lakes are *T*-1 around there . E_S
99380:19	It was real close to where I worked *T*-1 . E_S
99403:72	\[ Lake , \+ I think 0 Lake \] Whitmore is the only one 0 I have real memories of *T*-1 . Which *T*-2 is , N_S
99425:22	there was so much water around where I was *T*-1 . E_S
99447:29	and \[ d- , \+ is n't \] that where they have a summer music festival there , too *T*-1 ? E_S
99490:12	and the kids when they were young *T*-1 would just go nuts . E_S
99494:32	You know , because they were from Alabama where it never snowed *T*-1 E_S
99535:10	Course , when we get an ice storm *T*-1 , that 's not too much fun . E_S
99545:55	and , uh , the kids go down \[ the hi- , \+ the hill \] on the sleds when it 's icy *T*-1 , E_S
99632:34	My daughter was going , to Camp Goddard , um , which *T*-1 is through the Plano school system , you know in the fall couple of years ago E_S
99640:15	So , that 's how she started *T*-1 . E_S
99649:46	\[ Is , \+ is \] that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go *T*-1 E_S and they , weigh it or whatever *T*-1 E_S
99672:19	It *EXP*-2 's amazing how much plastic you generate *T*-1 . E_S
99675:19	I was amazed at how many cans that we got *T*-1 MUMBLEx E_S
99680:8	because when the kids first went down *T*-1 , I said , \[ that , \+ you know that 's \] great E_S
99681:62	and I was thinking , you know 0 maybe I 'd help *-1 supplement it , you know when they turned them in *T*-2 E_S
99685:22	but it *EXP*-3 's amazing how many cans you go through *T*-1 . And how fast they accumulate *T*-2 . E_S
99685:47	but it *EXP*-3 's amazing how many cans you go through *T*-1 . And how fast they accumulate *T*-2 . E_S
99692:23	and \[ how much , \+ how much \] we have reduced our waste . You know , that \[ we , \+ we 're \] generating *T*-1 a week *T*-2 . E_S
99696:27	Um , I know 0 our neighbors , when we first went to this bin program *T*-1 said , oh , there 's no way , you know 0 we 're going *-2 to have *-3 to have pickup twice a week *T*-4 . E_S
99720:42	and \[ that , \+ that \] has cut down a lot in what we throw *T*-1 out . E_S
99791:20	and they said something about how you do n't realize 0 even just your small contribution *T*-1 ,
99798:14	And , uh , when you read that *T*-1 you think , well gee , maybe it is a big deal , you know . E_S
99802:17	\[ What , \+ what \] *T*-1 makes me sick \[ is , \+ is \] when they show the dump sites you know , \[ and , \+ and , \] how big they are *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
99802:56	\[ What , \+ what \] *T*-1 makes me sick \[ is , \+ is \] when they show the dump sites you know , \[ and , \+ and , \] how big they are *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S

99843:19	Now \[ what , \+ what \] do they pick *T*-1 up ? E_S
99875:60	Well \[ we do n't , \+ we do n't \] take the newspaper * to begin with . When , neither one of us are home *-1 \[ t- , \+ to \] read it *T*-2 . E_S
99886:13	At first , when it first started *T*-1 , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it \] was hard . You know , because you 're just used to *-2 throwing things . E_S
99912:31	Well the kids have even got to the point where \[ they , \+ if they \] see anybody going in the trash can with a can , you know , \[ they , \+ they 're , \] oh , no , * do n't do that *T*-1 E_S
99958:28	but my , um , husband has an aunt who *T*-1 has been like a second mother , I mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such . E_S
99959:22	They live down in College Station where , his parents do too *T*-1 . E_S
99980:74	Then she was starting *-1 to \[ get , \+ uh , you know , lose \] memory sometimes \[ and , \+ which \] *T*-2 is kind of frightening when she 's in the car *T*-3 . E_S
99980:96	Then she was starting *-1 to \[ get , \+ uh , you know , lose \] memory sometimes \[ and , \+ which \] *T*-2 is kind of frightening when she 's in the car *T*-3 . E_S
99992:5	when it finally came down to it *T*-1 , um , she just got to the point after the , N_S
100018:40	and so often they think 0 they 're adequately caring for themselves when they 're really not eating \[ very much \+ or very balanced \] meals *T*-1 . E_S
100054:37	Although they 've got , uh , Meals On Wheels , Which I understand 0 *T*-1 is a really good , you know , way 0 * to handle that so that at least they eat *T*-2 . E_S
100121:39	Usually there has *-1 to be some wealth involved * , which *T*-2 is great , \[ \[ if , \+ if \] you 're financially , \+ \[ if , \+ if \] you do n't make the decisions so late that you 're worried about money \] E_S
100122:81	but \[ the , \+ the \] places like Presbyterian Village and some of \[ the , \+ the \] retirement places \[ where , \+ where \] they have different levels of care *T*-1 seems *-2 to be so much better , as far as elderly people adapting . E_S
100166:22	in fact , that 's probably what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen with my husband 's mother . E_S
100176:35	because \[ I th- , \+ I think , \] what do you have *T*-1 there ? E_S
100193:19	I just do n't understand why they , so much want *-1 to just stay in that building *T*-2 . E_S
100214:18	The child is going , why do n't you want *-1 to be close to me and your other family *T*-2 . E_S
100218:4	What *ICH*-1 does that house got *T*-2 attraction ? E_S
100239:10	Well , when she got home *T*-1 , who *T*-2 took care of her ? E_S
100239:28	Well , when she got home *T*-1 , who *T*-2 took care of her ? E_S
100252:39	and we ca n't see her often enough *-1 to really know what *T*-2 's going on . E_S
100286:55	Because \[ I , \+ I \] did n't know if that would make a difference in how you felt *T*-1 . E_S
100290:9	Um , what do you think *T*-1 about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two , N_S
100298:56	would \[ every- , \+ everyone \] grow up and mature \[ and , \+ and \] realize what this country 's all about *T*-1 . E_S
100309:31	\[ and , \+ and \] I agree with what you said *T*-1 that \[ it 's , \+ uh , it \] benefits the person doing it so much 0 I do n't think 0 they realize E_S
100330:125	\[ \[ they , just , \+ they were , \] \+ they did \] things for people , you know , for their communities , for \[ their , \+ their , \] uh , families , for their friends , where now , I 'm not sure 0 they really do *T*-1 . E_S
100337:84	\[ \[ \[ my first , \+ when I first thought of it *T*-1 , \] \+ I thought 0 it , \] \+ uh , when they asked the question *T*-2 I thought , \] well that sounds wonderful . E_S
100373:22	\[ Where , \+ uh , where \] abouts do you live *T*-1 ? E_S
100376:33	Well , I live in Richardson *ICH*-2 right now . Which *T*-1 is just , N_S
100429:31	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know how young you 'd have *-2 to go *T*-1 E_S
100443:24	There 's always something , no matter how young , E_S
100457:17	and , uh , sometimes what Richardson and Plano both , N_S
100458:13	I mean when you live in areas like that where there 's so much *T*-2 *T*-3 they do n't realize what a small percentage of the world that is *T*-1 . E_S
100458:37	I mean when you live in areas like that where there 's so much *T*-2 *T*-3 they do n't realize what a small percentage of the world that is *T*-1 . E_S
100458:71	I mean when you live in areas like that where there 's so much *T*-2 *T*-3 they do n't realize what a small percentage of the world that is *T*-1 . E_S
100543:69	I really feel fortunate in that there , even though there are problems , E_S they 're not a lot of problems where I teach *T*-1 . E_S
100548:10	Uh , when I was in Minnesota last summer *T*-1 there was a teacher who *T*-2 said that , uh , on a given day she did n't know how many of her students *T*-3 would show up E_S
100548:47	Uh , when I was in Minnesota last summer *T*-1 there was a teacher who *T*-2 said that , uh , on a given day she did n't know how many of her students *T*-3 would show up E_S

100561:48	And I can not imagine *-1 being able *-2 to do much of anything when they do n't even come to school *T*-3 . E_S
100564:107	Well just recently in the paper here , were *T*-4 articles about students , uh , working . High school students that *T*-1 work and the percentage of hours that they work *T*-2 and how that affects their grades *T*-3 . E_S
100572:16	but for those students who *T*-1 are determined *-2 to do well anyway , that , you know , * handling a job was very possible . You know , and that it seemed *-3 to have more 0 * to do *T*-4 with other factors . E_S
100578:17	You know like , what are their plans after high school *T*-1 , you know . E_S
100579:6	And what 's their home situation *T*-1 . E_S
100593:35	and it may be a survival thing for the family , which you can understand *T*-1 . E_S
100613:8	Well when they \[ meant , \+ said \] \[ the , \+ the \] topic , you know , of what *T*-1 's wrong with the public schools *T*-2 , \[ my , \+ my \] first \[ im- , \+ impulse \] was 0 it is n't really what *T*-3 's wrong with the \[ public , \+ public \] schools . E_S

100619:11	It 's what *T*-1 's wrong with families E_S
100627:16	they do n't know what * to expect *T*-1 at home . E_S
100629:16	they do n't know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen just out front of their apartment complex . E_S
100637:9	Uh , how can they concentrate on schooling *T*-1 ? E_S
100663:63	and they said , oh , \[ but \+ \] we need more in the middle school because that 's when kids are , you know , at a tougher and rougher age and all that *T*-1 . E_S

100745:20	You know , well , what kind of a situation do they get *T*-1 there E_S
100746:6	and what are , you know , N_S
100747:7	and what kind of state are we in *T*-1 \[ if , \+ if \] most people are going to private schools . E_S
100753:27	There will be a lot of people who *T*-1 will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world where they do n't try *-2 to educate everyone *T*-3 . E_S

100811:49	I guess 0 we 're both lucky . *-2 To be in situations and schools where we do n't see that *T*-1 . E_S
100826:19	So I 'll see you when we see you *T*-1 . E_S
100856:14	I started back when it *EXP*-2 was n't , stylish * to do that at all *T*-1 . E_S
100861:37	My daughter that *T*-1 's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby *T*-2 . E_S
100919:23	but , it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little *T*-1 E_S
100929:7	And what I liked *T*-1 about Preston Hollow is that the people that *T*-2 were there when Cheryl was two *T*-4 , which *T*-3 was fifteen years ago , many of them are still there today . E_S
100929:56	And what I liked *T*-1 about Preston Hollow is that the people that *T*-2 were there when Cheryl was two *T*-4 , which *T*-3 was fifteen years ago , many of them are still there today . E_S

100935:32	and these people that *T*-1 had changed her diapers when she was three *T*-2 were still there . E_S
100966:21	and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art *T*-1 E_S
100986:11	And parents who *T*-1 really want their kids to have any humanities are going *-2 to have *-3 to do that . E_S
100995:10	and then when they hit kindergarten *T*-1 , you know , it 's like wham . Culture shock . E_S
101008:4	Which *T*-1 is too bad . E_S
101046:30	Uh , the first one was an , elderly lady who *T*-1 was putting \[ a , \+ a \] daughter through nursing school just purely on baby-sitting money . E_S
101112:34	We have more options *ICH*-2 now then we did when \[ I , \+ \] my kids were born *-1 *T*-3 , E_S
101122:25	or they 've , you know , whatever schedule they want *T*-1 from a pay standpoint . E_S
101139:50	so \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] not tried them *-2 to see how effective they are *T*-1 E_S
101164:50	Well and I would think , you know , 0 since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions 0 they do *T*-1 *T*-2 you know , \[ the , \+ the \] people that *T*-3 work in big business have families E_S
101182:50	\[ That 's , \+ that \] was the rationale 0 they gave *T*-1 when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs *T*-5 that they want us to be happy and want us to be able *-2 to cope with *-3 trying *-4 to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces . E_S
101204:135	I have a couple of friends that , *T*-1 \[ have , \+ have \] found \[ \[ the , \+ uh , you know , a pri- , \] \+ a private \] home 0 * to take their children to *T*-2 when they 're young *T*-3 until they hit the preschool age . E_S

101257:49	\[ When I have , \+ \[ I , \+ I \] enjoy cooking when I have \] time *T*-1 . E_S

101390:16	I do n't know what that , N_S

101475:34	Um , and you can make a lot at one time when I needed *-1 to make something 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] give somebody *T*-2 . You know , like , you know , to take *T*-2 over to somebody 's house or something else *T*-3 . E_S
101491:29	\[ It , \+ it 's \] nice when it makes , a lot *T*-1 because you can feed your own family E_S
101497:20	because \[ I , \+ when I \] make this chicken casserole *T*-2 \[ \[ I , \+ it , \] \+ it \] makes a real big casserole and then another one that I freeze *T*-1 . E_S
101503:16	\[ What , \+ what \] does it have *T*-1 in it ? E_S
101520:5	when I do recipes *T*-1 I just throw stuff in . E_S
101647:9	So , when we 're here at home , you know , with sweets and stuff *T*-1 , \[ \[ they , \+ they do n't , \] \+ we do n't \] really do that much . E_S
101659:8	Now when they go to their grandmother 's house *T*-2 , which *T*-1 is every weekend . \[ It 's a , \+ it 's \[ a different \+ a different \] \] story all around . E_S
101659:38	Now when they go to their grandmother 's house *T*-2 , which *T*-1 is every weekend . \[ It 's a , \+ it 's \[ a different \+ a different \] \] story all around . E_S
101663:11	That 's when they , As our family would say , \[ a \+ \] pig out *T*-1 . E_S
101671:14	That 's exactly what it is *T*-1 . E_S
101752:4	what 's that mean *T*-1 ? . E_S
101809:5	What else *T*-1 has changed between the sixties and the eighties and the nineties ? E_S
101889:35	There are a lot of two parent , um , situations where the woman goes back to work because that 's what she wants *-1 to do *T*-2 *T*-3 , you know . E_S
101889:67	There are a lot of two parent , um , situations where the woman goes back to work because that 's what she wants *-1 to do *T*-2 *T*-3 , you know . E_S
101906:17	home study . Is that what you said *T*-1 ? E_S
101942:16	and you can tell which kids *T*-1 have been in day-care centers . E_S
101950:11	That 's what it all boils down to *T*-1 in the end , usually anyway . E_S
101954:4	When they 're young *T*-1 , N_S
101961:28	And that 's \[ the , \+ \] where it all starts *T*-1 E_S
101971:122	I know 0 \[ they do do some , \+ they do have some \] classes *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 in , um , high schools and things for kids 0 *T*-1 to , uh , give them an idea of what family life is like *T*-2 \[ and the , \+ uh , you know , and , uh , that \] kind of thing E_S
102010:28	and it *EXP*-2 would n't even really matter which restaurant it was *T*-1 ,
102025:30	\[ So \+ but , \] uh , anyway , where do you like *-1 to eat *T*-2 ? E_S
102047:9	Oh , which one do you like *T*-1 ? E_S
102074:9	So , when we go out *T*-1 , I 'm always looking for something other than the standard menu , even if , it 's a Mexican Restaurant , like something other than , uh , you know the standard tacos , enchiladas , tamales and fajitas now . E_S
102099:56	\[ and \+ uh , and , \] um , I 'm pretty adventurous in cooking , too , which *T*-1 also occasionally backfires . E_S
102104:35	I think 0 we 're supposed *-1 to say what *T*-2 will bring us back to a restaurant \[ or , \+ or \] what *T*-3 attracts us to a restaurant . E_S
102104:79	I think 0 we 're supposed *-1 to say what *T*-2 will bring us back to a restaurant \[ or , \+ or \] what *T*-3 attracts us to a restaurant . E_S
102105:4	How do you usually find \[ a , \+ a \] new restaurant *T*-1 ? E_S
102128:93	We have found , uh , a number of restaurants either through D \[ and \+ \] the , Friday paper and sometimes \[ the , \+ the \] OBSERVER . Which my husband usually picks *T*-1 up . And also through coupons . E_S
102134:5	When a new restaurant opens up *T*-1 , they usually send out coupons . E_S
102138:17	And you know , when they say , you know , *-1 buy one * get one free *T*-2 . It 's hard 0 * to resist *T*-3 , E_S
102183:67	So , uh anyway . I guess , uh , 0 \[ as far as , \+ as far as \] service when we go out *T*-1 gosh , \[ it 's nice , \+ it *EXP*-2 's nice \] * to have someone come and wait the table . And clear the table and , N_S
102201:18	but it 's not nice when they 're too attentive *T*-1 . E_S
102208:58	\[ \[ \[ M- , \+ m- , \] \+ m- , \] \+ my \] sister , who *T*-1 also lives here in Dallas , uh , tends *-2 to , uh , chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner , which *T*-3 drives me absolutely batty . E_S
102208:149	\[ \[ \[ M- , \+ m- , \] \+ m- , \] \+ my \] sister , who *T*-1 also lives here in Dallas , uh , tends *-2 to , uh , chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner , which *T*-3 drives me absolutely batty . E_S
102211:9	Well , how we N_S
102217:4	What 's your favorite restaurant *T*-1 ? E_S
102246:52	but , uh , oh we had \[ venison \+ venison \] chili *ICH*-2 one time . Which *T*-1 was absolutely wonderful . E_S
102253:23	well they 've never had it when we 've been back *T*-1 , E_S
102263:20	I do n't know people who *T*-1 hunt E_S
102292:4	What have you seen *T*-1 lately ? E_S
102295:4	when I tried , *-1 to make the call the other days *T*-2 , E_S
102358:7	And when I go *T*-1 , I go *-2 see two at a time . E_S
102380:15	But , that 's what I was , N_S
102419:21	And , I do n't know who *T*-1 was here or whether Jay called a friend E_S
102428:24	and it sounds like , uh , what you were just describing *T*-1 , SOAPDISH , too . E_S
102479:54	Oh , so I went up *-1 to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that 's what everybody wants *T*-2 , E_S
102511:5	Whatever you call *T*-1 easy , I 'll do it , you know . E_S
102517:93	And so , \[ I do n't , \+ I 'm \] real glad that we did n't go *-1 see those funny ones \[ when I was , \+ when I 'm \] still sort of on the sore side *T*-2 . E_S
102522:21	well , \[ wha- , \+ what 's \] your next , N_S
102540:22	Uh , and that *ICH*-3 's what he would have liked *-1 to have seen *T*-2 REGARDING HENRY , too , E_S
102542:53	\[ we 've , \+ we 've \] got a lot of company this summer , which *T*-1 is wonderful . E_S
102553:10	Um , when the choir group went *-1 to see BACKDRAFT *T*-2 and they thought 0 \[ that was , \+ uh ,
102577:32	I really , uh , like him a lot . Which *T*-1 is why , DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie 0 we had seen *T*-2 for several months *T*-3 E_S
102577:43	I really , uh , like him a lot . Which *T*-1 is why , DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie 0 we had seen *T*-2 for several months *T*-3 E_S
102594:22	And I really enjoy Harrison Ford which *T*-1 is one of the reasons 0 I wanted *-2 to see *T*-3 , N_S
102616:16	my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie 's age *T*-1 . E_S
102632:22	Um , we do it more when we have company come *T*-1 . E_S
102640:20	so , um , mostly like when we go out *T*-1 , you know , it 's my husband and I , E_S
102649:9	Um , where , about is that *T*-1 ? E_S
102674:22	and we came up one time when my father was visiting *T*-1 E_S
102684:7	Now where is the Atlantic Cafe *T*-1 ? E_S
102690:60	Um , and \[ o- , \+ originally \] the two , \[ the , \+ the \] guy who *T*-1 owns the Cafe Pacific and \[ th- , \+ the \] guy who *T*-2 owns the Atlantic Cafe , were partners in the Atlantic Cafe . E_S
102690:101	Um , and \[ o- , \+ originally \] the two , \[ the , \+ the \] guy who *T*-1 owns the Cafe Pacific and \[ th- , \+ the \] guy who *T*-2 owns the Atlantic Cafe , were partners in the Atlantic Cafe . E_S
102697:13	You know what we 'd really like *T*-1 , \[ if , \+ if \] we just have \[ a , \+ a \] casual evening is Houston 's . E_S
102730:16	You know right away what you want *T*-1 . E_S
102732:33	I know right away \[ what we , \+ what we \] want *T*-1 . E_S
102740:23	my in-laws also enjoy prime rib , when they 've had some of their specials on Sunday , Monday , or Tuesday night *T*-1 E_S
102827:19	We 've tried different ones when they 've had them as one of the *T*-1 N_S
102874:69	\[ but , \+ uh , and \] we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert , which *T*-1 was a chocolate sack . E_S
102884:16	\[ Where , \+ where \] it 's made , N_S
102930:13	you know , how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it *T*-1 E_S
102946:68	Well , that 's , uh , one of the things \[ th- , \+ that \] I do enjoy *T*-2 when you get a good restaurant *T*-1 . E_S
102982:6	When we do go out *T*-1 , um , in a way it 's like a little mini vacation I guess 0 *T*-2 , E_S
103001:12	They do what they call *T*-1 a salad sampler which *T*-2 easily could feed two or three . E_S
103001:34	They do what they call *T*-1 a salad sampler which *T*-2 easily could feed two or three . E_S
103008:4	Where do you live *T*-1 ? E_S
103015:4	Where do you live *T*-1 ? E_S
103048:18	Particularly in the areas where there are industries *T*-1 , uh , where they are burning a lot of coal , and oil *T*-3 \[ up , \+ more up \] north , I guess *T*-2 , uh , E_S
103048:42	Particularly in the areas where there are industries *T*-1 , uh , where they are burning a lot of coal , and oil *T*-3 \[ up , \+ more up \] north , I guess *T*-2 , uh , E_S
103074:65	I think 0 \[ it gives off , \+ uh , in the emissions , it gives off \] gases which *T*-1 combine up in the atmosphere , uh , and form \[ a , \+ a \] weak acid . E_S
103081:17	like you 've seen what it 's done *T*-1 to buildings even where it 's really bad *T*-2 . E_S
103081:43	like you 've seen what it 's done *T*-1 to buildings even where it 's really bad *T*-2 . E_S
103088:5	What *T*-1 's interesting , several years ago , I took a course , uh , on , uh ,
103089:93	well , N_S \[ it was actually , \+ it was \] put *-2 on by the power companies \[ and , \+ \] about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was *T*-1 , E_S and there was n't *T*-1 from various kinds \[ of , \+ of \] energy . N_S
103093:41	And it 's turned out that , that 's been very true , what he was forecasting *T*-1 about the accumulation \[ of , \+ of \] the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do *T*-2 to foliage . E_S
103093:110	And it 's turned out that , that 's been very true , what he was forecasting *T*-1 about the accumulation \[ of , \+ of \] the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do *T*-2 to foliage . E_S
103094:38	So , it 's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when I took that course *T*-1 . E_S
103096:49	Uh , I 'm not afraid of nuclear , *-1 having had that course because of how the nuclear that , uh , they use *T*-2 is not bomb quality *T*-3 , E_S
103110:110	But , that 's the only sensible thing 0 * to do *T*-2 , is * recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground . As far as I 'm concerned , where it could eventually , perhaps , there 's some problem , uh , pollute the groundwater *T*-1 . E_S
103111:20	So , I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
103129:23	we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston *T*-1 E_S
103134:21	Oh . I do n't know what * to , N_S
103146:61	\[ I do n't know what , \+ uh , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what \] the problem is *T*-1 E_S
103147:14	but , uh , when we lived in Houston *T*-1 we had a solar water heater E_S
103178:16	I do n't know how long that 'll take *T*-1 , E_S
103191:13	But , uh , who *T*-1 knows what the future will hold *T*-2 . Uh , as far as energy goes , E_S
103191:24	But , uh , who *T*-1 knows what the future will hold *T*-2 . Uh , as far as energy goes , E_S
103222:35	I know 0 I was part of the me generation where \[ \[ they did n't , \+ MUMBLEx so many of them did n't , \] \+ people did n't \] care *T*-1 . E_S
103233:9	So , how do you feel about capital punishment *T*-1 ? E_S
103268:10	no matter how rotten they were *T*-2 , somebody loves them . E_S
103283:17	but , you know when I hear about things like , you know , \[ what they 've , \+ what they 've \] been reporting about *T*-1 in Milwaukee , you know *T*-2 \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ to me I \] do n't see any way of * rehabilitating the guy . E_S
103283:70	but , you know when I hear about things like , you know , \[ what they 've , \+ what they 've \] been reporting about *T*-1 in Milwaukee , you know *T*-2 \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ to me I \] do n't see any way of * rehabilitating the guy . E_S
103334:49	\[ but \+ uh , you know , but \] that would be a situation where if somebody 0 you know *T*-1 was gon *-2 na be , you know N_S
103337:26	, I mean , it was disgusting when I read about it today *T*-2 . E_S
103338:21	\[ And , \+ and \] when you find someone like that , that you know 0 *T*-1 is guilty *T*-2 , he confessed already to * killing eleven \[ \[ I , \+ I 'd , \] \+ you know , I \] guess 0 I have a hard time * feeling merciful toward him , E_S
103348:7	Especially when it 's so far removed *T*-1 . E_S
103374:40	and , you know , you just think , you know , where 's the justice *T*-1 here . E_S
103378:52	I mean , you know , they 're not even having *-1 to serve out what they should be serving *T*-2 . E_S
103382:16	I 'm not sure what their policy is *T*-1 on capital punishment E_S
103403:32	I guess 0 violent crimes would be the crimes where I can see it making the most sense *T*-1 . E_S
103413:147	, I mean , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] not saying 0 \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ capital murder \+ or capital punishment \] is the perfect solution in every case , you know , especially because there are some cases when you just do n't know *T*-1 E_S
103429:6	And what is he going *-1 to do *T*-2 prison to the other people ? E_S
103435:23	\[ from , \+ from \] what I hear *T*-1 about jail life * is not any way 0 * to live *T*-2 . E_S
103442:76	Well , \[ I was , \+ I saw \] on a human interest story , or whatever today , 0 there was a woman who *T*-1 was just being paroled *-2 and trying *-2 to make it back , E_S
103456:68	\[ and , \+ and , \] \[ it really is n't , \+ for some people \[ tha- , \+ \] who *T*-1 have been there for over , and over , and over , it really is n't , \] uh , as bad . E_S
103466:41	and maybe that 's \[ why , \+ one of the reasons why \] crime has gone up *T*-1 , because it 's not so scary anymore . E_S
103478:7	And what they 're going *-1 to be doing *T*-3 when they get out *T*-2 . E_S
103478:37	And what they 're going *-1 to be doing *T*-3 when they get out *T*-2 . E_S
103485:31	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what the perfect solution to that is *T*-1 E_S
103486:29	but I know that especially with violent crimes where , you know , you 're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they 're guilty and without much repentance or anything else *T*-1 , you know , then , I do n't know , \[ I , \+ I \] guess , 0 \[ I , \+ I \] just really do n't see much use for this guy in Milwaukee , you know . E_S
103492:7	and when she heard the topic *T*-1 , she said , capital punishment , E_S
103535:175	I guess 0 \[ I enjoy , \+ I enjoy \] \[ jazz , \+ * listening to jazz \] sometime although I do n't feel like I have a \[ \[ good , \+ g- , \] \+ good \] understanding of it , or \[ a good , \+ a good \] feel for maybe what *T*-1 's good jazz and what *T*-2 's not , E_S
103535:193	I guess 0 \[ I enjoy , \+ I enjoy \] \[ jazz , \+ * listening to jazz \] sometime although I do n't feel like I have a \[ \[ good , \+ g- , \] \+ good \] understanding of it , or \[ a good , \+ a good \] feel for maybe what *T*-1 's good jazz and what *T*-2 's not , E_S
103650:4	What did they name him *T*-1 ? E_S
103659:32	I keep *-2 forgetting , \[ what , \+ what \] she named him *T*-1 . E_S
103781:16	I do n't know how else * to explain *T*-1 . E_S
103785:54	and , uh , we try *-1 to make contact with them periodically *-3 to see what *T*-2 's going on and stuff , too , E_S
103795:25	my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs *T*-1
103796:7	and when they come on *T*-3 we have *-2 to turn the radio up full blast E_S
103862:64	And , uh , it kind of makes me listen a little closer \[ to , \+ to \] the piano when I hear it at other places *T*-1 , or when I , you know , \[ see some , \+ see and hear \] someone playing *T*-2 . E_S
103862:93	And , uh , it kind of makes me listen a little closer \[ to , \+ to \] the piano when I hear it at other places *T*-1 , or when I , you know , \[ see some , \+ see and hear \] someone playing *T*-2 . E_S
103863:64	I sort of watch their technique , too , \[ and , \+ and \] see if it corresponds up to what she 's learning *T*-1 . E_S
103876:44	I guess 0 we collect \[ m- , \+ milk \] cartons and whatever \[ p- , \+ other plastics \] *T*-1 are acceptable . E_S
103878:25	Are you in the part of town where , uh , they have gotten into the other containers *ICH*-1 yet for recycling *T*-2 ? E_S
103886:99	and I could n't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just 0 everybody \[ was , \+ was \] waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were *T*-1 . E_S
103892:19	So I have no idea what they look like *T*-1 E_S
103896:99	\[ th- , \+ That 's \] going *-1 to be interesting because \[ it 's , \+ uh , we 've \] gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which *T*-2 is , uh , N_S
103906:31	it *EXP*-2 will be interesting * to see how well that works *T*-1 E_S
103909:62	Uh , I do n't know \[ if , where you grew up *T*-2 in your , \+ \] what you saw *T*-1 back , uh , years ago , E_S
103910:81	but for me the thing that *T*-1 strikes me is \[ 0 I , \+ \] uh , * growing up in rural South Dakota where , hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them *T*-4 is that , uh , in the fifties , uh , you could say 0 *T*-5 we had the recycling going on then that we should have *T*-3 now . Which *T*-2 was 0 all the milk bottles were glass E_S
103910:231	but for me the thing that *T*-1 strikes me is \[ 0 I , \+ \] uh , * growing up in rural South Dakota where , hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them *T*-4 is that , uh , in the fifties , uh , you could say 0 *T*-5 we had the recycling going on then that we should have *T*-3 now . Which *T*-2 was 0 all the milk bottles were glass E_S
103917:25	and you got a nickel or dime , which in that time *T*-1 was a lot of money , when you returned them *T*-2 . E_S
103917:58	and you got a nickel or dime , which in that time *T*-1 was a lot of money , when you returned them *T*-2 . E_S
103933:31	You could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed *T*-1 E_S
103957:70	So , uh , you know , \[ \[ we , \+ when we go *-3 dump , \] \+ actually when we go *-1 dump \] our things *T*-2 , oh , we collect newspapers , too , and then take them , E_S
103964:16	I did n't know what *-2 to expect *T*-1 . E_S
104028:58	and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons , the wood , uh , racks which now , basically , you could turn *T*-1 them into the plastic ones that *T*-2 would hold , uh , twenty-four bottles . E_S
104036:36	Well , it *EXP*-1 will be interesting * to see how , over the next year , this all works out *T*-2 because , like on the , uh , grass , \[ I 'm , \+ I \] know 0 your husband , uh , does n't really like the paper sacks . E_S
104048:39	and \[ Neal , \+ uh , Neal 's \] a person who *T*-1 says , I like *-2 to pick it up E_S
104062:11	I wonder where they dump that *T*-1 . E_S
104072:16	and then , uh , who *T*-1 knows how they process it from there *T*-2 and what they turn it into *T*-3 , E_S
104072:28	and then , uh , who *T*-1 knows how they process it from there *T*-2 and what they turn it into *T*-3 , E_S
104072:53	and then , uh , who *T*-1 knows how they process it from there *T*-2 and what they turn it into *T*-3 , E_S
104086:28	but I 've trimmed trees and other things which , uh , *T*-1 end up *-3 being something that , *T*-2 clearly wo n't decompose nearly as rapidly , E_S
104091:7	so when the computer picked this one *T*-1 , I was a little bit surprised , E_S
104103:29	and that was THE TERMINATOR movie , uh , which I did n't like *T*-1 after all . E_S
104175:26	\[ th- , \+ that 's \] what I heard *T*-1 , too . E_S
104177:36	we 've got *-1 to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late * to watch it *T*-2 . E_S
104192:4	Which *T*-1 was an interesting movie , but not very funny . E_S
104217:52	And , of course , I get *-1 to watch all these movies like * LOOK WHO *T*-2 'S TALKING and \[ WHO *T*-4 'S , \+ * LOOK WHO *T*-3 'S \] TALKING , TOO E_S
104217:95	And , of course , I get *-1 to watch all these movies like * LOOK WHO *T*-2 'S TALKING and \[ WHO *T*-4 'S , \+ * LOOK WHO *T*-3 'S \] TALKING , TOO E_S
104308:41	\[ I , \+ I \] know 0 we get discount tickets where my husband works *T*-1 , E_S
104314:39	you almost ca n't afford *-1 to do it . No matter what . E_S
104320:30	and we got *-1 to go *-2 see WHAT ABOUT BOB ? E_S
104338:44	Oh , \[ that 's the , \+ that 's the \] one where they burn down the house or something *T*-1 E_S
104369:58	and so \[ they , \+ they \] tended *-1 to want *-2 to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things 0 * to do *T*-3 *T*-4 , E_S
104396:21	so occasionally I 'll bring whatever *ICH*-2 I 've got *T*-1 laying around the car or the like and throw them in there . E_S
104398:67	but , as far as a habit at the house , uh , I have n't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants *-2 to pick *T*-1 up . E_S
104402:24	I read in the paper this week where maybe , N_S
104409:18	I 'm not sure all what we 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do *T*-3 , whether we have three separate containers , E_S
104410:28	I really do n't understand that part on what they 've told you *-1 to separate everything *T*-2 . E_S
104426:103	at the time anyway , \[ it , \+ \] the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted * properly and that \[ at , \+ at \] the collection sites where everything 's clearly labeled *-1 *T*-2 and people that *T*-3 happen *-4 to go to that kind of trouble *-5 to do it , happen *-6 to do it pretty well , E_S uh , those are okay * to have the general public doing the sorting . E_S
104441:46	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] know other places when they recycle *T*-1 ,
104442:65	they have *-4 to , like , wash out their glass jars and whatnot . \[ And , \+ \] uh , which we 're not in the habit of *-2 doing *T*-3 . E_S
104472:59	and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough * to buy whatever we wanted *T*-1 for the day E_S
104496:23	and when we buy the soda when it 's on sale for ninety-nine cents *T*-1 , E_S
104508:4	Where do you take your cans *T*-1 ? E_S
104512:29	oh , N_S I think 0 the kids , when we were on vacation *T*-1 , they said 0 they did take them to \[ a , \+ a \] recycling place , probably at one of the li- , N_S
104525:54	And then once in a while I 'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I do n't want *-1 to \[ re- , \+ \] go back to work *T*-2 . What I enjoy *T*-3 about * staying home . E_S
104525:109	And then once in a while I 'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I do n't want *-1 to \[ re- , \+ \] go back to work *T*-2 . What I enjoy *T*-3 about * staying home . E_S
104558:58	GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that *T*-1 kind of sets around for \[ when , \+ uh , when \] I 'm really have time and I really want *-2 to read something *T*-3 , you know . E_S
104575:32	so I guess 0 that kind of tells you what kind of person I am *T*-1 . E_S
104580:17	\[ When , \+ when \] I had my magazines at home *T*-1 , I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures , you know , E_S
104587:16	Well , That 's what I do *T*-1 . E_S
104603:15	and you think , where did I ever put that recipe *T*-1 . E_S
104616:31	But I kind of stay with my own subject matter what , uh , *T*-1 pertains to my daily life at the present time . E_S
104641:14	I do that when we travel *T*-1 . E_S
104642:43	I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we , N_S
104646:9	no matter what it is *T*-1 ,
104660:11	That 's when you really have time *T*-1 . E_S
104672:42	It was , you know , kind of a little bit more than what I needed *T*-1 , E_S
104674:17	\[ I \+ , when I \] bought the computer *T*-1 , all of a sudden I was receiving them , for some unknown reason , through the mail . E_S
104706:6	And how can a country stand *-1 to , uh , spend as much or much more than they already are *?* on such a problem *T*-2 , uh , E_S
104723:64	but , uh , I 've heard it on more than one documentary that , uh , they were complaining that whoever *T*-1 's sitting up there *-2 making these decisions or whatever institutions *T*-3 raise the money and , uh , N_S
104723:98	but , uh , I 've heard it on more than one documentary that , uh , they were complaining that whoever *T*-1 's sitting up there *-2 making these decisions or whatever institutions *T*-3 raise the money and , uh , N_S
104736:4	What did you think *T*-1 about that idea ? E_S
104752:56	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 there 's just some strange public opinion as to who they want *-1 to give to *T*-4 .

104772:82	\[ but , \+ but \] then , again , \[ we really , \+ we really \] do have it as a society *-3 to decide which things we need *-1 to address *T*-2 . E_S
104774:202	and many of those things , uh , if they 're not able *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] be insured *-2 then the country 's going *-3 to pay for it one way or the other .

104814:24	They certainly do well for those who *T*-1 go to the symphony orchestra and all that , E_S
104822:44	I 'd feel much more comfortable than I do now , based on what I 've been hearing *T*-1 in the newspapers . E_S
104836:81	\[ It 's , \+ uh , it *EXP*-2 's \] a scary thing * to know that , uh , you just do n't know what people are doing *T*-1 uh , before they go to work . E_S
104848:22	probably just for our own safety when we 're traveling and things *T*-2 that would be something 0 I 'd like *-1 to know that *T*-3 's going on . E_S
104853:36	so I , N_S it 's very near and dear to me when we start *-1 talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause , this type of thing *T*-2 . E_S
104883:58	but , uh , in the long run , it seems to me , 0 it 's kind of like what they keep *-1 talking *T*-2 about \[ the , \+ uh , the \] AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that , you know , N_S
104883:127	but , uh , in the long run , it seems to me , 0 it 's kind of like what they keep *-1 talking *T*-2 about \[ the , \+ uh , the \] AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that , you know , N_S
104923:71	People are afraid *-1 to fly now . You know , just because \[ of , \+ \] they do n't know what their pilot 's been doing *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and \] things like that E_S
104933:22	Well , \[ you , \+ where you 're \] located *-2 *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] do know 0 *T*-3 Texas Instruments has random drug testing . E_S
104961:16	I do n't know what the crime is like *T*-1 where you are *T*-2 , E_S
104961:35	I do n't know what the crime is like *T*-1 where you are *T*-2 , E_S
104969:82	and \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] unbelievable \[ \[ what , \+ what , \] \+ what *T*-1 's \] going on and \[ the drugs , \+ the selling of drugs . \] E_S
104988:20	It 's best done *-1 when you have leisure time *T*-2 E_S
105001:163	couple of guys , uh , restored an old wooden boat that *T*-1 was built *-2 back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real \[ h- , \+ big \] old four- foot center board that *T*-3 went down in the middle *-5 to keep you upright when the waves , E_S or the wind came from the side *T*-4 E_S
105020:4	What are your memories of boating *T*-1 , E_S
105024:47	my husband 's family had \[ a , \+ a \] motor boat , uh , when we got engaged *-2 *T*-1 E_S
105042:18	I remember *-1 learning how * to ski *T*-2 , oh , E_S
105054:19	but it bit enough to where I let *-1 go *T*-2 . E_S
105059:19	and so I told everybody what *T*-1 happened E_S
105067:66	So I moved over \[ a , \+ a \] few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living *T*-1 underneath the dock and , uh , managed *-2 to get up . E_S
105071:22	but now I 've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me *T*-1 . E_S
105074:43	and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] know how you can get injured *-1 *-1 doing much more than that *T*-2 E_S
105078:107	I 'd kind of like , someday , *-1 to maybe end up on a pair of skis \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 does n't have a , uh , well , N_S what they call *T*-3 trick skis . N_S
105090:37	You need somebody 0 *T*-1 to kind of tell you what * to do *T*-2 , E_S
105091:15	but , just from what I 've seen *T*-1 , you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick , you know . Grab the rope behind you and then just let * go real quick and let it whip you around . E_S
105100:4	Where is your favorite place 0 * to go *T*-2 *T*-1 ? E_S
105112:16	\[ When , \+ when \] both of my kids were much younger *T*-1 . E_S
105145:22	I just kind of join up when it 's something interesting *T*-1 E_S
105212:23	And , uh , * just travel whenever we can *?* *T*-1 . E_S
105218:5	when I heard my topic today *T*-1 , I thought , okay \[ that 's my fav- , \+ that 's my favorite \] N_S
105227:102	and , uh , it has just worked out really well with this , uh , position 0 he 's in *T*-1 . Because I can go at a spur of the moment or what have *T*-2 you E_S
105231:17	and it *EXP*-3 depends where he 's going *T*-2 whether or not I decide *-1 to go along E_S
105249:5	What more could you ask for *T*-1 ? E_S
105288:10	Uh , when we normally go that way *T*-1 , we like *-2 to go to California at the same time , because we really do n't get out there as often as you could *?* probably from Texas . E_S
105307:16	Now we did , what we sometimes do *T*-1 since we are in Ohio E_S
105308:53	and it *EXP*-2 takes a while * just to even get to \[ the , \+ what I would call *T*-1 the \] more picturesque part of the country , E_S
105329:4	why do n't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you 'd look for *T*-1 in your next *T*-2 . E_S
105329:32	why do n't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you 'd look for *T*-1 in your next *T*-2 . E_S
105343:14	and , uh , what else do I want *T*-1 . E_S
105355:12	that 's what it would be for *T*-1 is for him to drive back and forth to work . E_S
105359:7	but when we were looking *T*-2 we were looking for something that *T*-1 had enough seat belts , of course , E_S
105371:22	and we 'd look for about what you 're looking for *T*-1 . E_S
105454:10	is that how they do it at T I *T*-1 maybe . E_S
105494:76	they could just go off the deep end \[ \[ on , \+ on a , \] \+ on something \] uh , that whatever they 're taking *T*-1 at the time N_S
105540:19	and I do n't know how many others *T*-1 are doing that E_S
105552:54	it 's just a problem that \[ p- , \+ \] no one is sure just how * to handle *T*-2 *T*-1 I think 0 *T*-3 . E_S
105558:17	There 's several reason why \[ I , \+ I \] could think of *T*-1 right now why we should n't have it *T*-2 such as drug testing , E_S they say , runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time 0 you do it *T*-1 . E_S
105558:57	There 's several reason why \[ I , \+ I \] could think of *T*-1 right now why we should n't have it *T*-2 such as drug testing , E_S they say , runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time 0 you do it *T*-1 . E_S
105619:43	and \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't know why they both made him do that *T*-1 since it was so close together . E_S
105628:8	from what I understanding *T*-1 here at T I , they run close to a thousand dollars an employee . E_S
105654:4	What are yours *T*-1 ? E_S
105671:4	How did you ever get into that *T*-1 ? E_S
105685:34	Well , I painted an awful lot until his death , which *T*-1 was several years . E_S
105744:17	But , uh , just when I thought 0 I really enjoyed my hobby *T*-1 , yours sounds great . E_S
105752:5	What part of Ohio are you in *T*-1 ? E_S
105759:26	And Cleveland is n't all as bad as what you 've heard *T*-1 . E_S
105761:9	Oh , what 's that *T*-1 , N_S
105772:4	where you 're getting into the delicate work *T*-1 . E_S
105776:24	Now , \[ do you , \+ where did you \] first get your lessons from *T*-1 ? E_S
105789:26	I had a friend from Albany , which *T*-1 is about thirty-six miles away , E_S
105803:45	I have been a little bit negligent about it because I was so tired when I had *-1 to go to work after my husband 's death *T*-2 . E_S
105833:90	And , uh , actually it 's very easy for me , because \[ I , \+ I \] \[ have a prac- , \+ make it a practice \] when I am out *T*-1 , E_S
105834:18	I eat differently than what I could eat *T*-1 at home or around here . E_S
105853:26	So \[ where are your , \+ what are the \] \[ places , \+ you know , memorable places \] 0 you 've eaten *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
105901:66	So , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't know \[ what *T*-1 's , \+ what *T*-2 's \] down there , the ones out in Addison . E_S
105913:16	\[ why , \+ which \] one were you going *-1 to recommend *T*-2 ? E_S
105963:32	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ when I \] went *T*-1 , I thought 0 the food was not good . E_S
105976:22	See , \[ I , \+ when I \] went *T*-1 , I thought , N_S
105984:39	but then I just thought 0 the food was over priced for what it was *T*-1 . E_S
105992:48	I make it a habit of * always going out to Pasta Oggi 's which *T*-1 is right down there in Ad- , N_S
106008:20	sometimes I 've been *?* when I thought , Well , it was n't as good *T*-1 , E_S
106039:37	\[ I \+ they 've \] been *-2 doing that when , uh , the circuits are busy *T*-1 E_S
106047:21	I guess 0 that 's what they need *T*-1 for their machines to get everything down pat , E_S
106065:4	How would you feel *T*-1 about * sending an elderly family member to a nursing home ? E_S
106069:35	We sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of * caring for himself anymore *T*-1 . E_S
106081:7	And what type of recommendations did you have *T*-1 when you decided where * to place him *T*-2 *T*-3 ? E_S
106081:31	And what type of recommendations did you have *T*-1 when you decided where * to place him *T*-2 *T*-3 ? E_S
106081:42	And what type of recommendations did you have *T*-1 when you decided where * to place him *T*-2 *T*-3 ? E_S
106084:49	\[ we , \+ he \] wanted *-1 to get into a Mennonite nursing home which *T*-2 is very popular and hard 0 * to get into *T*-3 and had like a ten year waiting list E_S
106094:29	Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it *T*-1 , because he suddenly got sick and needed *-2 to be put *-3 in . E_S
106104:9	Uh , what do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
106117:47	and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what *T*-1 was called *-2 an independent living facility *T*-3 . E_S
106143:28	and I 've got little children *ICH*-2 here who *T*-1 needed me here E_S
106159:57	even though I would have liked *-1 to have had her stay , with her health being what it was *T*-2 she could n't *?* anymore . E_S
106188:23	well , I think 0 sometimes when people get *-1 to be a certain age *T*-2 , other people have *-3 to kind of help them make decisions . E_S
106196:105	well \[ that 's , \+ yeah , that 's \] right that the children have some responsibility *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 , too , to their parents and such , * to help * decide what *T*-2 's the right thing . E_S
106202:28	but we feel 0 she 's much safer where she is *T*-1 now . E_S
106204:7	but when she does *T*-1 \[ there , \+ \] a nurse is right there * to help her E_S
106209:21	and her doctor 's right there where he can come in and check on her *T*-1 , E_S
106227:5	What kind of painting was it *T*-1 ? E_S
106258:15	Oh , well , what kind of paint did you use *T*-1 for the , um , bookends ? E_S
106262:7	and when I painted them *T*-1 , I did n't realize that we did n't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house . E_S
106297:30	Oh , \[ is , \+ is \] that what you usually use *T*-1 in the house , is latex ? E_S
106329:14	and , um , what I had *-1 to do *T*-2 is just *-1 coat this bare wood with a sealer , E_S
106434:9	Well , how long did it take you all *T*-1 ? E_S
106447:53	and \[ there was , \+ I was \] just painting because I do n't know how * to do anything else *T*-1 . E_S
106458:28	as long as the hardware store told me what * to buy *T*-1 , then I could do it . E_S
106465:23	it 's a nice shiny gloss , which *T*-1 was true , E_S
106468:18	but I did n't realize what , you know , pain it *EXP*-2 is *T*-1 * to clean the brushes and everything , if you do n't have latex E_S
106474:25	Uh , \[ what i- , \+ what is \] your practice *T*-1 as far as budgeting ? E_S
106481:12	That 's how kind of I am *T*-1 , too . E_S
106491:54	My husband always says 0 he earns it , and I have *-1 to spend only what he earns *T*-2 . E_S
106499:20	and he always threatens that when I spend more than , what *T*-1 's coming in *T*-3 , I have *-2 to go back to work E_S
106499:40	and he always threatens that when I spend more than , what *T*-1 's coming in *T*-3 , I have *-2 to go back to work E_S
106514:40	and we found that we just were n't making the most of what we had *T*-1 , E_S
106517:10	And then what *T*-1 's left *-2 we divvy up *T*-3 . E_S
106549:35	and , uh , they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used *-2 to *?* *T*-1 E_S
106554:54	but we make * sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we 're going *-1 to pay for it ahead *T*-2 E_S
106572:60	In fact , we are in a position that most of our friends \[ why , \+ wonder why \] we just do n't go to a new car , you know , whatever *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
106600:22	and I said , you know how when you have a bad one *T*-1 , you say , never again *T*-2 E_S
106600:27	and I said , you know how when you have a bad one *T*-1 , you say , never again *T*-2 E_S
106622:45	and uh , it depends , because I do n't like *-1 to sell what we 're trading *T*-2 in to an individual uh , unless \[ we , \+ we \] have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted *-4 to sell *T*-3 *T*-5 E_S
106622:109	and uh , it depends , because I do n't like *-1 to sell what we 're trading *T*-2 in to an individual uh , unless \[ we , \+ we \] have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted *-4 to sell *T*-3 *T*-5 E_S
106648:6	and how do you hold to yours *T*-1 ? . E_S
106672:23	and that was the envelope system . Where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did *T*-2 last month that you are going *-1 to spend *T*-4 *T*-5 , E_S
106672:47	and that was the envelope system . Where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did *T*-2 last month that you are going *-1 to spend *T*-4 *T*-5 , E_S
106672:59	and that was the envelope system . Where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did *T*-2 last month that you are going *-1 to spend *T*-4 *T*-5 , E_S
106678:89	And then for some reason * taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form , uh , causes you to realize how much *T*-1 is left *-2 . E_S
106679:58	And she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope , what she 's buying *T*-1 . E_S
106703:11	That 's what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
106731:60	Because if you charge things , uh , you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month , when you get paid *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
106745:5	What we 're in the process of * doing *T*-1 right now is * paying off our credit cards entirely . E_S
106749:51	And we 're going *-1 to go ahead and try *-4 to just live on what we earn *T*-2 instead of *-5 guessing ahead of what we probably will have *T*-3 next month . E_S
106749:83	And we 're going *-1 to go ahead and try *-4 to just live on what we earn *T*-2 instead of *-5 guessing ahead of what we probably will have *T*-3 next month . E_S
106761:22	Uh , there was a time when maybe we did n't take all of them off *T*-1 , E_S
106765:31	but you just sort of had *-1 to watch what you put *T*-2 in , because you hate *-3 to pay those finance charges , when you see how much it is *T*-4 *T*-5 . E_S
106765:79	but you just sort of had *-1 to watch what you put *T*-2 in , because you hate *-3 to pay those finance charges , when you see how much it is *T*-4 *T*-5 . E_S
106765:91	but you just sort of had *-1 to watch what you put *T*-2 in , because you hate *-3 to pay those finance charges , when you see how much it is *T*-4 *T*-5 . E_S
106793:11	you know what I 'm saying *T*-1 ? E_S
106797:41	And so , \[ that , \+ that 's \] the difference there where sometimes like I know 0 if we 've had an especially bad month and we 're just almost getting down to payday , then I think 0 if we could really budget *T*-1 , N_S
106799:15	I know 0 when we were planning *-2 to buy the new car and we had n't had a car payment in five years *T*-7 , we had *-1 to go ahead and write down each month what it was *T*-3 that every penny went for *T*-4 , *-9 to see how much *T*-8 was going *-5 to be left *-6 , E_S
106799:114	I know 0 when we were planning *-2 to buy the new car and we had n't had a car payment in five years *T*-7 , we had *-1 to go ahead and write down each month what it was *T*-3 that every penny went for *T*-4 , *-9 to see how much *T*-8 was going *-5 to be left *-6 , E_S

106809:29	\[ It , \+ it \] is *?* when you do it that way *T*-1 . E_S
106815:46	So it *ICH*-1 's kind of hard * to say 0 this is how much you 're going *-2 to spend *T*-4 *-3 going out for fun . E_S
106816:12	This is how much you 're going *-1 to spend *T*-2 . E_S
106846:4	what minuscule amount I made *T*-2 N_S
106876:11	That 's what I 'm working toward *T*-1 . E_S
106972:78	and a lot of the restaurants they just have , uh , places \[ where you can throw away , \+ especially beer places , where you can throw away \] green bottles , and then the brown bottles *T*-1 . E_S
107000:19	So , I guess 0 when you live in a bigger city *T*-1 \[ it , \+ it \] really becomes , uh , necessary . E_S
107041:34	they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it *EXP*-3 mean *T*-4 * to recycle , and what can you recycle *T*-1 and what you ca n't *?* *T*-2 . Because , you know , not a lot of people do really know \[ what , \+ you know , what \] it 's for *T*-5 . E_S
107041:69	they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it *EXP*-3 mean *T*-4 * to recycle , and what can you recycle *T*-1 and what you ca n't *?* *T*-2 . Because , you know , not a lot of people do really know \[ what , \+ you know , what \] it 's for *T*-5 . E_S
107041:87	they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it *EXP*-3 mean *T*-4 * to recycle , and what can you recycle *T*-1 and what you ca n't *?* *T*-2 . Because , you know , not a lot of people do really know \[ what , \+ you know , what \] it 's for *T*-5 . E_S

107112:9	So , when you see something that *T*-1 's on recycled paper *T*-2 , they 've actually gone to a lot of expense *-3 to do that . E_S
107124:30	but there 's really a big cost incurred * when you do recycle something *T*-1 . E_S
107165:4	How would you go about *-1 organizing a family reunion *T*-2 ? E_S
107178:17	I have a friend who *T*-1 just went to , like , Wyoming to some big ranch , you know , where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion *T*-2 . E_S
107178:67	I have a friend who *T*-1 just went to , like , Wyoming to some big ranch , you know , where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion *T*-2 . E_S
107183:17	so I mean , how I would go about *-1 doing it *T*-2 is I would just call all my relatives . E_S
107195:15	you know , when I go home *T*-2 I try *-1 to see the families , as much of the family as I can *?* E_S
107234:9	Um , how do you like it *T*-1 ? E_S
107243:9	Oh , what kind do you have *T*-1 ? . E_S
107322:16	I do n't know how yours has been *T*-1 . E_S
107342:101	But , um , as far as the gardening and things like that goes *?* I do n't know , uh , \[ too much , \+ too much \] about , uh , how much I really \[ r- , \+ \] do enjoy it myself *T*-1 . E_S
107353:16	Well , how about when you were in Colorado *T*-1 ? E_S
107363:28	Well , and then , too , now like where we had the dry summer and we had *-2 to sprinkle constantly *T*-1 . My water bill was high . E_S
107416:14	It 's about why there are n't more people that *T*-1 are voting and participating in *T*-2 ... N_S
107418:6	And what is your feeling *T*-1 ? E_S
107456:95	that 's one thing that I have learned *T*-1 \[ in *-2 w- , \+ working in \] elections and things is , you know , 0 sometimes even when you work for someone *T*-3 you do n't really know what they 're like *T*-4 . E_S
107456:129	that 's one thing that I have learned *T*-1 \[ in *-2 w- , \+ working in \] elections and things is , you know , 0 sometimes even when you work for someone *T*-3 you do n't really know what they 're like *T*-4 . E_S
107458:7	and when they got in office *T*-1 it was just a disaster . E_S
107462:37	Uh , \[ and , \+ and \] I 'm not sure how you go about *-1 really finding out what people are really like *T*-2 before you vote for them *T*-3 . E_S
107462:64	Uh , \[ and , \+ and \] I 'm not sure how you go about *-1 really finding out what people are really like *T*-2 before you vote for them *T*-3 . E_S
107470:16	I do n't know why we are so complacent *T*-1 , E_S
107499:50	\[ what do you think \+ and this is not one of our questions but what do you think *T*-1 \] of this no excuse absentee balloting ? E_S
107540:18	and I do n't know why we could n't have duplicate voting on some of this *T*-1 . E_S
107542:121	Well , hopefully \[ once they have , \+ uh , you know , once they 've \] checked them off the list N_S \[ they , \+ they \] do have *-1 to check them off a list when they vote *T*-2 E_S
107552:4	when I lived ... N_S
107563:5	when we were like \[ in , \+ in \] our teen ages *T*-2 E_S we 'd go on Sundays and visit , you know , the older people . E_S
107569:49	So I kind of know \[ how it *EXP*-4 is * to , \+ how *-1 to \] decide if you want *-2 to put somebody in a rest home *T*-3 E_S
107588:22	and so he 's the one who she moved in with *T*-1 when she had a stroke *T*-2 E_S
107588:42	and so he 's the one who she moved in with *T*-1 when she had a stroke *T*-2 E_S
107607:104	And , you know , just , you see a lot of things like \[ you , \+ you \] know , MUMBLEx was a great golfer and wanted *-1 to play golf when he retired *T*-2 , E_S
107608:59	and you know that a lot of the things 0 he thought 0 he would do *T*-1 when he retired *T*-3 he 's not able *-2 to do *T*-4 now . E_S
107618:12	and is that how your parents feel *T*-1 E_S
107625:14	She says that when her husband died *T*-1 \[ that he said , \+ oh , that my uncle had said \] that he would never \[ ha- , \+ \] put her in a rest home . E_S
107647:31	and I just really feel bad for the guy who *T*-1 his whole life is different *ICH*-2 now E_S and , than he thought 0 it would be *?* . E_S
107650:4	When he retired *T*-1 ? E_S
107654:104	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , he 's the one because he 's the one that * is n't going to work every day and that she moved in with *T*-2 when she needed *-3 to move in with someone *T*-4 . E_S
107669:10	and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever *T*-1 , I do n't know what they 're going *-2 to do *T*-3 . E_S
107669:51	and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever *T*-1 , I do n't know what they 're going *-2 to do *T*-3 . E_S
107684:47	\[ I- , \+ my fiancee and I \] both figure 0 that 's what 's , we 're going *-1 to end up with *T*-2 both of the parents or whoever . E_S
107688:11	You know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
107704:49	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] \+ I 'm \] not really familiar with how other countries , E_S
107741:4	How old are you *T*-1 ? E_S
107754:85	Well this is a subject that you never think 0 you 'll be assigned *-1 to *T*-2 . One that *T*-3 kind of comes up when you 've lost \[ it , \+ the \[ others , \+ other \] subjects *T*-4 . \] E_S
107797:76	but as soon as the plane got through the clouds E_S and I saw all those trees , E_S it just really made me realize how much I miss the fall *T*-1 . E_S
107809:38	so it *EXP*-1 was nice * to get off the plane where it was in the seventies *T*-2 . E_S
107817:48	and \[ they , \+ you know , they \] have tons of canyons where the leaves change *T*-1 E_S
107824:14	We did that when we lived up in Michigan *T*-1 . E_S
107829:38	And then on leaf weekends *ICH*-2 \[ it was , \+ which *T*-1 is this time of the year , it 's \] bumper to bumper traffic , E_S
107831:5	whoever *T*-1 was driving could never have a prayer of * looking at the leaves , because they had *-2 to keep *-3 watching the road . E_S
107851:24	We 'll have *-1 to see how it goes *T*-2 , E_S
107862:37	I mean , nothing comparable , I guess , to what you 've had *T*-1 before . E_S
107908:4	why do n't you start *T*-1 E_S
107918:7	well how do you dress for work *T*-1 ? E_S
107924:61	The , um , thing \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 distinguishes me a lot of the time when I have *-2 to dress real professionally for a meeting or something *T*-3 is 0 I wear a clerical collar and a suit and , uh , all of that sort of thing , E_S
107928:7	but when I do n't need *-1 to dress up for \[ a , \+ a \] meeting or a service of some sort *T*-2 , I do n't . E_S
108003:10	and even when his job is not going *-1 to be with people all day long *T*-2 , he said 0 it *EXP*-4 's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have *-3 to dress . E_S
108032:88	Well , another interesting thing on \[ \[ the \+ our , \] \+ our \] end here is \[ how , \+ even in my forties , how \] much younger *ICH*-2 I dress *T*-1 than my mother would have *?* in her forties , E_S
108054:24	MUMBLEx I guess 0 this is what you call *T*-1 a natural end . E_S
108057:19	\[ what kind , \+ what kind \] of shoes do they wear *T*-1 down there ? E_S
108101:28	It 's on your favorite T V shows and why . E_S
108104:12	well , so what is your favorite T V show *T*-1 ? E_S
108116:24	You know , it 's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows *T*-1 *T*-2 E_S
108116:50	You know , it 's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows *T*-1 *T*-2 E_S
108123:4	What kind do you like *-1 to watch *T*-2 ? E_S
108127:13	and , uh , what 's the other one *T*-1 now ,
108143:67	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 that is supposed *-1 to be put *-2 out at a time when I was growing up or whatever *T*-3 . E_S
108151:7	and when you have children uh , watching it *T*-2 , that sometimes really starts *-1 to bother me E_S
108170:4	which \[ \[ I \+ \[ just , \+ \] I was , \] \+ I always felt \] 0 *T*-1 was wonderful E_S
108180:55	like I said , the risque stuff , just I guess 0 they think 0 that 's what people want *-1 to watch *T*-2 . E_S
108193:7	and when he left the show *T*-1 , you know , \[ that , \+ \] it seemed *-2 to be missing that part of it E_S
108343:5	What kind of music do you like *T*-1 ? E_S
108364:24	some of the punk , um , when I was in high school *T*-1 , that was , uh , one of the big things , was punk music , E_S
108372:114	Uh , well , \[ \[ \[ it , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's , \] \+ it \] really expresses some of the opinions \[ of , \+ of \] the people who *T*-1 enjoy the music E_S
108408:24	I do n't enjoy that at all when they 're just talking about , well , I 'm better than you , and blah , blah , blah *T*-1 . E_S
108480:94	and the other thing 0 I do n't like *T*-1 about it is 0 they have a tendency * to play the instrumental so loud that you ca n't understand what the lyrics are *T*-2 E_S
108484:17	you ca n't understand what they 're saying *T*-1 on some of those songs which *T*-2 probably is just as well on some of them , too . E_S
108484:49	you ca n't understand what they 're saying *T*-1 on some of those songs which *T*-2 probably is just as well on some of them , too . E_S
108505:117	You know if it 's informal I 'd probably choose something , I mean , just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because that 's a lot of fun , especially this time of year where it 's so nice out *T*-1 . E_S
108522:6	So what do you use *T*-1 for cookbooks ? E_S
108524:38	Um , I have a PILLSBURY cookbook 0 I got *T*-2 when I was married *-1 *T*-3 , E_S
108534:43	\[ but \+ and , \] of course , you get a lot from when you 're growing up *T*-1 . E_S
108546:25	but , what you serve *T*-1 or what would you , N_S
108562:18	it 's a good reference when you need *-1 to dig something up *T*-2 . E_S
108566:5	What we 've found *T*-1 very useful is a book called * THE THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK , E_S I think 0 that 's the title , by Marion Burroughs E_S
108570:10	uh , which *T*-1 has recipes which *T*-2 allegedly can all be prepared *-3 in thirty minutes
108570:25	uh , which *T*-1 has recipes which *T*-2 allegedly can all be prepared *-3 in thirty minutes
108595:4	What 's one of your favorites *T*-1 ? E_S
108636:11	That 's why sometimes I shy away from , uh , more of a traditional cookbook *T*-1 E_S
108649:4	what would I put *T*-1 together for a formal dinner . E_S
108655:75	the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert , you know , a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of MUMBLEx cookbook which *T*-1 has a recipe for a thing called * chicken marabella um , which *T*-2 is this wonderful thing 0 you can do *T*-3 , um , E_S
108655:119	the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert , you know , a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of MUMBLEx cookbook which *T*-1 has a recipe for a thing called * chicken marabella um , which *T*-2 is this wonderful thing 0 you can do *T*-3 , um , E_S
108701:28	I found 0 my kids were very frustrating when they were little *T*-1 in terms of their tastes . E_S
108750:4	What school are you going to *T*-1 ? E_S
108765:7	And what field of study are you in *T*-1 ? E_S
108783:14	Oh . Well , what *T*-1 took you to North Carolina ? E_S
108843:13	so depending on what your major is *T*-1 , or medical , you might want *-2 to \[ atteck- , some , \+ um , attend somewhere \] like Tech E_S
108849:32	well some schools may even give you financial aid , where another one wo n't *?* *T*-1 . E_S
108874:4	what did you say *T*-1 ? E_S
108876:5	What kind of grant was it *T*-1 ? E_S
108908:61	\[ there 's , \+ there 's \] a lot of different organizations \[ who , \+ uh , who \] *T*-1 do give grants , E_S
108909:28	but , uh , I 'm not exactly sure which ones they are *T*-1 and how much , \[ they , \+ you know , they \] generally run *T*-2 . E_S
108909:47	but , uh , I 'm not exactly sure which ones they are *T*-1 and how much , \[ they , \+ you know , they \] generally run *T*-2 . E_S
108914:36	it was just based *-1 on , you know , how much your tuition costs *T*-2 and everything , E_S
108997:70	\[ they 're , \+ they 're \] bent on , uh , * seeing \[ how much land , \+ how much more land \] they can get *T*-2 , and \[ how much , \+ uh , how much \] of the campus they can build *T*-1 up E_S

109013:16	\[ What , \+ what \] do you feel 0 *T*-2 is \[ the , \+ the \] major change that *T*-1 's been going on ? E_S
109048:35	Well , you know , it 's interesting , because when I heard the topic *T*-1 , I was thinking , uh , N_S
109049:65	this summer Oprah had a T V show about wives that *T*-1 refused *-2 to go to work , and how their husbands thought 0 they were terrible *T*-3 , E_S
109091:105	and I think 0 it 's going *-1 to have *-2 to swing back the other way , because I think 0 we 're going *-3 to have an awful lot of kids who *T*-4 are going *-5 to have major problems from all this . E_S
109103:16	\[ What , \+ what \] grade do you teach *T*-1 ? E_S
109109:4	where do you live *T*-1 ? E_S
109121:34	she has a few friends that *T*-1 have moms who *T*-2 are still at home , E_S
109157:5	when I said 0 \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] raising them *T*-1 , I am *?* , N_S
109159:20	and we 're talking about what the girl said *T*-1 in class , E_S and , you know , what *T*-1 's right because there 's no mother at home E_S
109159:60	and we 're talking about what the girl said *T*-1 in class , E_S and , you know , what *T*-1 's right because there 's no mother at home E_S
109185:10	and then when , you know , they go on one salary *T*-3 , will they be able *-2 to sustain what their life-style is *T*-1 . E_S
109185:67	and then when , you know , they go on one salary *T*-3 , will they be able *-2 to sustain what their life-style is *T*-1 . E_S
109198:4	Why do n't you go ahead and say what you feel *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
109198:28	Why do n't you go ahead and say what you feel *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
109210:104	\[ and , \+ uh , so , \] I 've been very guilty about *-2 not making the effort *-3 \[ to , \+ to \] \[ take things where \+ take things where \] they belong *T*-1 . E_S
109212:9	Well , how long have you been here *T*-1 ? E_S
109227:56	You need *-1 to get into \[ the \+ the \] system a little more and know where * to take things *T*-2 . E_S
109245:9	Well , where do you take those things *T*-1 ? E_S
109254:9	Well , where do you do that *T*-1 , E_S
109259:18	but I did n't know where * to take them *T*-1 . E_S
109278:7	and what I hear *T*-1 a lot of neighborhoods do have \[ the , \+ the \] pickup now , E_S
109291:66	but the trucks that *T*-1 were supposed * to do it , there 's been some problems with *T*-4 from what I 've read *T*-3 in , you know , the mail that we get *T*-2 E_S
109319:21	so , I 'll be glad when the bins do come *T*-1 , E_S
109320:23	and I think 0 that 's when \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] start *-2 doing the plastic , too *T*-1 . E_S
109340:10	Well , how much do you earn *T*-1 on the cans , E_S
109341:44	\[ I , \+ I \] did n't know \[ ho- , \+ what \] kind of an idea * to give her *T*-1 for , N_S
109343:10	Oh , when we first \[ were , \+ were \] here *T*-1 , it was like we 'd take maybe \[ a , \+ oh , a \] grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full , E_S
109359:4	which *T*-1 is understandable , E_S
109368:7	and whatever pop we drink *T*-1 , we used *-2 to take the boys out for a bike ride , and pick up the litter , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] cans E_S
109383:39	and , you do get *-1 to stop once in a while when there is a can *T*-2 *-3 to rest , E_S
109426:28	five minutes \[ is , \+ is \] when they cut in and \[ say , \+ say , \] we do n't have any more room for recording *T*-1 . E_S
109450:6	So what is your house like *T*-1 ? E_S
109493:14	We outgrew it when we moved in *T*-1 . E_S
109547:5	how many bedrooms is it *T*-1 ? E_S
109571:36	But it *ICH*-3 sure is nice * to have it when the kids come over *-1 to play *T*-2 E_S
109596:6	And how old 's the youngest *T*-1 ? E_S
109612:36	but they 're just about *-1 to get too tall , where the dresses are beginning *-2 to drag *T*-3 you know , E_S
109628:11	That 's what we 'd like *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
109681:9	Well , what *T*-1 are the colors in your house ? E_S
109717:30	it was redone *-1 at the time probably when earth tones were in *T*-2 E_S
109782:9	but , when we first moved to Coppell , it 's what *RNR*-1 , six years ago *T*-2 , we did n't even have a grocery store E_S
109811:44	and Coppell 's now about the size that Lewisville was *T*-1 when , when I moved down here *T*-2 . E_S
109816:10	Well , when we first moved here *T*-1 , we moved here from Lubbock E_S
109850:35	\[ but , \+ um , so \] did you hear what the topic was *T*-1 E_S
109882:76	but I guess 0 more than anything I think 0 maybe people were just kind of wanting *-1 to have the choice of what they could do *T*-2 , you know E_S
109898:17	\[ Ho- , \+ how \] many kids do you have *T*-1 ? E_S
109916:100	and , uh , \[ I just , \+ it *EXP*-4 's just \] weird that I was just talking to somebody *ICH*-3 this morning \[ who *T*-1 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] \[ a working , uh , lady , \+ a working mom , \] E_S
109923:38	and I hope 0 it just does n't get *-1 to where , you know , there 's \[ more women , \+ more and more women \] going into the work force *T*-2 . E_S
109940:21	and everyone 's all interested in what everybody 's doing *T*-1 , E_S
109942:49	and I found that all 0 I talked about *T*-1 was my baby , which *T*-2 was fine with me , E_S
109947:140	and , you know , they kind of looked at me like I was from the dark ages , you know , \[ like I , \+ \] because I did n't have really all that much 0 * to talk about *T*-1 , uh , where career and things like that were concerned *T*-2 , E_S
109952:4	which *T*-1 is too bad , because , you know , \[ \[ I , \+ I feel like I do n't , \] \+ obviously I do n't \] get paid *-2 for my job , E_S
109953:31	but I should get paid *-1 at least double what my husband makes *T*-3 *-2 working in an office for * staying home E_S
109957:11	that 's what I figure *T*-1 , E_S
109958:25	I 'm worth a lot just for what I do *T*-1 every day , E_S
109978:15	I found 0 when I did do some work *T*-1 when my son was young *T*-2 , it was like contract work , E_S
109978:37	I found 0 when I did do some work *T*-1 when my son was young *T*-2 , it was like contract work , E_S
109979:15	and it was n't where I had *-1 to be there every day *T*-2 , E_S
109981:20	so , I do n't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time 0 * to do anything besides * go to the doctor *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
109985:14	I can see where that would definitely hinder the problem *T*-1 , E_S
109993:32	I have a dog *ICH*-1 named * Grisly , who *T*-2 's a ten year old , uh , mixed breed between Golden Retriever , Afghan Hound and Chow . E_S
110002:45	I used *-1 to have box turtles , um , well , years ago , when I was growing up *T*-2 E_S
110038:6	And how big do they get *T*-1 . E_S
110049:13	and that 's what we had intended *-1 to get *T*-2 in Houston , E_S
110051:14	and *-3 knowing how they love *-1 to dig and love the water *T*-2 , um , \[ and \+ \] we thought 0 that was kind of a tough climate E_S
110091:6	And how do you spell that breed *T*-1 ? E_S
110096:6	And how do you pronounce that *T*-1 ? E_S
110167:9	And about how much are they *T*-1 ? E_S
110171:50	They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars , I think 0 *T*-2 which I thought 0 *T*-1 was a lot . E_S
110195:12	that 's what we 'd rather have *T*-1 is just a pet , instead of N_S
110199:26	we used *-1 to show Saint Bernards when I was a little girl *T*-2 . E_S
110211:16	Oh , that 's where I live *T*-1 , E_S
110213:16	Oh , that 's where I live *T*-1 , too . E_S
110218:9	Well , how did you like that topic *T*-1 ? E_S
110239:20	but if you 'll remember when the teachers had *-1 to take the T CAT *T*-3 they were talking about *-2 drug testing us E_S
110283:47	and I think 0 it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read *T*-1 , you know , E_S
110302:28	\[ The , \+ the \] job is what *T*-1 provides all of your needs , E_S
110313:14	I can see where you would think , E_S
110331:77	well , but \[ why , \+ if you 're going *-1 to do teachers or professionals , why \] not * do the kids , when we see them *T*-2 and they 're , you know , under the influence *T*-2 . E_S
110344:17	I do n't know how long we 're supposed *-1 to carry on a conversation *T*-2 , do you ? E_S
110347:18	and the clicker comes in when it 's time 0 * to *T*-1 , N_S
110379:36	and there was an incident in my children 's high school , where a teacher stayed drunk *T*-1 , E_S
110390:5	when I think of drug testing *T*-1 , I 'm thinking of the , you know , outside of education . E_S
110405:26	well , did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation *T*-1 . E_S
110433:39	and yet , I know of , you know , one teacher who *T*-1 was an alcoholic in school as well as , you know , I presume out , E_S
110467:37	so we 're going *-1 to talk about , uh , what kind of clothes we wear *T*-2 while we work . E_S
110510:11	That 's how I am *T*-1 too . E_S
110512:71	We go from regular kind of spring clothes regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes , clothes that *T*-1 are in between where you 're not down to regular size yet or you 're on your way up from regular size *T*-2 E_S
110539:26	I know 0 that 's kind of how I am *T*-1 . E_S
110540:17	I said , who ever I talk to *T*-1 is going *-2 to be board , because when it 's summer time *T*-3 , I 'm wearing shorts , E_S
110540:60	I said , who ever I talk to *T*-1 is going *-2 to be board , because when it 's summer time *T*-3 , I 'm wearing shorts , E_S
110541:7	and when it 's cold *T*-1 , I 'm wearing sweat pants , \[ and most of , \+ \] unless I 'm going to something special that my daughter 's doing *T*-2 , or something like that , E_S
110571:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
110606:20	course I 'm always hot when I 'm pregnant , too *T*-1 , E_S
110642:40	\[ if we , \+ if we \] had professional jobs where we go into an office and have *-1 to wear a jacket or something *T*-2 that would make a big difference . E_S
110646:16	I worked part time when my oldest was a baby *T*-1 E_S
110663:32	\[ I , \+ I \] remember that from when I was , N_S
110708:24	and um , I had a friend who *T*-1 used *-2 to take shorts to work , E_S
110724:108	because you can ruin your good clothes *-5 getting so hot in them \[ if you \+ \] especially if it 's something that *T*-1 has *-2 to be dry cleaned *-3 , which I do n't have any of *T*-4 . E_S
110733:5	when you have children *T*-1 , you do n't , E_S
110734:13	um , even when I go to church *T*-3 I have *-1 to have something 0 I can just throw *T*-4 in the washer when I 'm through *T*-2 . E_S
110734:81	um , even when I go to church *T*-3 I have *-1 to have something 0 I can just throw *T*-4 in the washer when I 'm through *T*-2 . E_S
110750:11	that 's how I am *T*-1 , too , E_S
110798:101	but I 'm really having questions \[ if , \+ if \] I can deal with that system \[ and , \+ and \] have a good conscience about , you know , what I do *T*-1 . E_S
110811:17	she 's always worried who *T*-1 's looking over her shoulder E_S
110814:4	What child *T*-1 's going *-2 to say something 0 some parent 's going *-3 to overreact to *T*-4 E_S
110858:7	and when we moved down here *T*-1 , I was just appalled that they were still doing it here , E_S
110902:106	\[ and a lot of their classes , \+ from the time 0 they were about third grade *T*-1 , \[ they , \+ they \] changed classes \] several times during the day , which *T*-2 has its pros and cons , E_S

110958:36	Well , Eric seems *-1 to have quite a few nights where he does n't have any *T*-2 , E_S
110969:8	but , who *T*-1 knows what he 's going *-2 to bring *T*-3 home . E_S
110969:19	but , who *T*-1 knows what he 's going *-2 to bring *T*-3 home . E_S
110979:16	Lawn and garden work and what you enjoy *T*-1 and what kind of work you do *T*-2 . E_S
110979:33	Lawn and garden work and what you enjoy *T*-1 and what kind of work you do *T*-2 . E_S
111013:18	so I do n't know what *T*-1 happened last week E_S
111076:35	I still have caladiums that *T*-1 are pretty , which *T*-2 is a surprise this late in the year . E_S
111111:22	Well , Texas has gotten to where it 's a real problem as far as plants , because our summers are so terribly hot *T*-1 E_S
111120:51	Some of the things that *T*-1 used *-2 to be hardy are getting to where they do n't make it through the two swings *T*-3 . E_S
111135:21	Well , the summers have gotten where they 're a lot hotter *T*-1 E_S
111171:27	Except for the lack of trees , out where we are *T*-1 .
111176:7	and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful *T*-1 *T*-2 , we really miss it . E_S
111176:35	and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful *T*-1 *T*-2 , we really miss it . E_S
111194:9	And , when we got out to the area where we decided 0 we were going *-1 to live and buy a house *T*-2 *T*-3 , there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land E_S

111210:52	I got her for Christmas from my family , \[ and , \+ \] uh , back when we lived in Nebraska *T*-1 . E_S
111236:62	and \[ he 's , \+ I , \] um , got him in Arizona \[ and , \+ \] when I used *-1 to live there *T*-2 , E_S
111243:5	What kind of cat is it *T*-1 ? E_S
111247:100	\[ he was , \+ um , he was \] born *-1 in the wild , like \[ in a , \+ in a \] shed and had never been in a building when I got him *T*-2 . E_S
111268:7	and when he was younger *T*-1 I think 0 *T*-2 he started them , E_S
111334:33	Well , I 'll tell you an interesting story about how I got my dog *T*-1 , E_S
111349:9	so , when I got back home to Carney , Nebraska *T*-1 , I told my wife about it , E_S
111353:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
111378:4	Where do you enjoy *-1 dining out *T*-2 ? E_S
111398:5	What area of the country do you live in *T*-1 ? E_S
111427:51	and it *EXP*-3 's a pain * to have *-1 to stand there and see what it is *T*-2 before you leave E_S
111435:30	So , we try *-1 to hit those places when we can *?* *T*-2 . E_S
111437:5	When we travel *T*-1 we look for Wendy 's because we have kids , E_S
111457:11	That 's what you find *T*-1 , E_S
111477:16	so that might be why I look for inexpensive places *T*-1 just because we 're eating out probably five nights a week maybe . E_S
111490:9	Well , what are some of \[ your , \+ your \] favorite inexpensive places *T*-1 ? E_S
111508:11	that 's where we always go *T*-1 , E_S
111527:4	Where do you go *T*-3 if you like *-1 to have a nice meal *ICH*-2 out , or a big meal ? E_S
111531:4	Where do you go *T*-1 for steaks ? E_S
111533:14	It 's usually when we 're out of town *T*-1 E_S
111548:11	That 's where we go *T*-2 *-1 to get steaks E_S
111553:7	and when we have something 0 * to celebrate *T*-1 *T*-2 , we head to Houston 's . E_S
111567:24	We do n't usually take the kids when we go there *T*-1 , E_S
111595:37	but I think 0 it all began *-1 eating out when we had , uh , the boys \[ \[ in , \+ in \] different , uh , baseball \+ on baseball \] tea- *T*-2 , N_S
111608:96	I 'm not one that *T*-1 's going *-2 to fix , you know , the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they 're there *T*-3 . E_S
111618:41	So \[ that , \+ you know , that \] really snowballed when we got down here *T*-2 , when I started *-1 to sub , make money *T*-3 ,

111642:46	I sometimes have a problem with some of the , especially more famous people who *T*-1 all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork *-2 to say that whatever problems they have *T*-3 , you know , \[ was , \+ was \] because they were \[ abused a- , \+ abused *-4 as \] children . E_S

111701:26	well , she looked like my mother who *T*-1 abused me when I was a child *T*-2 , or something , which I think 0 *T*-3 is , unfortunate for that person and yet should n't be an excuse . E_S

111717:100	but I thought , uh , you know , 0 \[ if these things , \+ if children \] are being abused *-1 , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] wondering how our school system is failing *T*-2 , that they 're not even seeing this , you know , E_S
111718:23	if it was that severe that when they 're later in life adults *T*-1 , that it 's all of a sudden affecting them in this way , that it was n't shown *-2 up at all when they were younger *T*-3 , N_S

111729:20	and I lived in California which I feel like California , you know , N_S
111740:66	and , uh , you know , \[ there was , \+ there was , \] nothing on it , E_S which *T*-1 makes me wonder , you know , if it 's as , uh , prevalent \[ as , \+ as \] some of them claim . E_S

111826:4	What are your favorite places *T*-1 ? E_S
111846:12	but our favorite when you have a little more 0 * to spend *T*-1 *T*-2 , is * to go to Taiwan or May Dragon . E_S
111903:11	That 's what he , N_S
111912:20	you always stand in line when you go *T*-1 E_S
111980:13	and , oh , what is that guy 's name *T*-1 ? E_S
112000:40	My husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go *T*-1 after a theater or after the movie . E_S
112018:21	I think 0 that 's what \[ goes , \+ you know , *T*-1 really goes \] right now \[ in the , \+ in the \] Dallas area . E_S
112050:17	I had a friend who *T*-1 was taken *-2 to Lawry 's downtown for prime rib E_S
112067:17	\[ when , \+ when \] I go out *T*-1 , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] normally * to get , um , some specialty type of food E_S

112109:26	They like *-1 to go pretty much where we like *-2 to go *T*-3 E_S
112151:59	I have one that *T*-1 's a freshman in high school , a daughter . And a son who *T*-2 's a sixth grader in a middle school . E_S
112175:14	it really helped when the , uh , older one was old enough * to get his license and could , uh drive around by himself *T*-1 although that brought in a whole \[ n- , \+ other \] set of problems . E_S
112203:22	and \[ the , \+ \] whatever season it is *T*-1 \[ he 's , \+ he 's \] playing , although football is really his favorite . E_S
112241:25	and my kids wanted *-1 to learn how * to play it *T*-2 E_S
112247:39	And it 's a game that none of their friends know how * to play *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
112311:87	\[ obv- , \+ obviously \] things are different \[ from , \+ *ICH*-2 for \] me *ICH*-1 \[ than , \+ \] and my children than when I was growing up *T*-3 . E_S
112317:10	And then what my father did *T*-1 \[ was , \+ was , \] uh , \[ in- , \+ \] you know , obvious to me E_S
112319:55	But , uh , although I have brought my boys \[ into \+ *-2 to \] see where I work *T*-1 , it 's not that easy , E_S
112329:21	and we still do n't know what he does *T*-1 . E_S
112348:23	He 's been on temporary duties where he 's been gone nine months *T*-1 . E_S
112366:70	so \[ we just , \+ you know . I just \] do the carpooling \[ and , \+ and \] handle whatever *T*-1 needs *-2 to be done *-3 . E_S
112382:29	And hopefully he wo n't have too many surprises when he gets home *T*-1 . E_S
112423:40	But \[ I would , \+ I would \] not really know how * to go about *-1 selecting one nowadays *T*-2 , E_S
112433:25	And one of the key things is how many adults are there *T*-1 in ratio to the children . E_S
112458:5	What we do *T*-3 is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep *T*-2 that *T*-1 are , um , low to the ground E_S

112628:35	Um , I need *-1 to definitely take a vacation where \[ all , \+ all \] 0 I do *T*-2 is * rest *T*-3 . E_S
112726:27	But you know , it seems 0 when your family \[ is , \+ is \] different places *T*-1 , a lot of trips involved * going *-2 to visit . E_S
112733:46	we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and I are both from *T*-1 . E_S
112759:136	Uh , \[ my , \+ my \] idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be 0 * to begin with , uh , money be no object .

113051:19	This interstate seventy-five song . Or whatever *ICH*-2 it was *T*-1 about Central Expressway and * getting it done in nineteen ninety-five and everything . E_S
113058:8	Even when they were losing pitifully *T*-1 , you know , people still support them . E_S
113068:16	\[ What , \+ what \] do you think *T*-1 about them ? E_S
113089:21	I got in trouble *ICH*-2 when I was in the service *T*-1 quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble . E_S
113107:40	\[ I , \+ I \] made a rule *ICH*-3 with myself when I got one *T*-2 that if I could n't pay it in full every month that I 'd have *-1 to rip it up , E_S

113411:16	I do n't know what we 're going *-1 to be able *-2 to do *T*-3 about it E_S
113414:14	so I guess why should the government *?* *T*-1 . E_S
113422:20	it really does bother me when I think about , you know , * leaving our children \[ with , \+ with \] this sort of , uh , a national problem that we ca n't seem *-1 to find \[ an , \+ an \] answer to *T*-2 it *T*-3 , uh , E_S

113533:21	Well , I do n't know what Oklahoma 's laws are *T*-1 E_S
113545:16	Well , that 's what ours did *T*-1 ,

113827:103	Well , I found it *EXP*-2 interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said , well , if there is a problem , what should we do *T*-1 about it ? E_S
113844:33	\[ I was , \+ I was \] wondering what your response would be *T*-1 . E_S

113858:6	so where did your parents come from *T*-1 ? E_S
113885:6	But what do you think *T*-1 , E_S
113901:30	Because we have just , had a Naturalization Act where the Mexicans that *T*-1 were residents in Texas , I 'm from Texas \[ and \+ \] have become citizens now *T*-2 . E_S
113910:4	What do you think *T*-1 about that ? E_S
113925:9	So , when you were giving your answer *T*-2 I was thinking , is this a Texan 0 I 'm talking to *T*-1 ? . E_S
113935:69	Well , a lot of the experience that I have *T*-1 with this problem has * to do with my brother-in-law who *T*-2 's Chinese and immigrated from China . E_S
113950:39	It *EXP*-3 's just very difficult * to get a woman who *T*-1 does n't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily *-2 to visit here . E_S
113968:67	\[ that 's , \+ and I think 0 that 's \] pretty crazy , because I mean those students who *T*-1 were in America when that was happening *T*-2 are almost certainly going *-3 to be in trouble if they go back , E_S

113988:4	What do you think *T*-1 about that ? E_S
114027:17	\[ my , \+ when my \] daughter was in high school *T*-1 , one of the custodians was Vietnamese E_S

114036:41	Just recently I was kind of laughing \[ when I , \+ when I \] heard the switchboard talking about the question *T*-2 because , uh , I had *-1 to have my , uh , radiator flushed *-3 E_S

114104:11	that 's where I was *T*-1 . E_S
114136:7	So when I cross that one *T*-1 I 'll be okay . E_S

114211:48	You got *-1 to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance *T*-2 . E_S
114225:44	Well , I think 0 they get the new Z-bart stuff and everything to where you can , um , N_S
114245:22	just because that way I know what *T*-1 's wrong with my car and what it needs *T*-2 and what it really does n't *T*-3 . E_S

114382:30	I mean if you could legislate something , what would you legislate *T*-1 ? E_S
114398:119	And the people making these calls would be obliged *-6 to \[ c- , \+ compare \] \[ the , \+ their \] lists that they 're going *-1 to call *T*-2 against this list of people who *T*-3 do n't want *T*-4 to be called *-5 . E_S

114418:20	Sort of like an unlisted number where you have n't gone to the trouble of * enlisting yourself *T*-1 . E_S
114443:21	I do n't mind the children when they 're selling things for school *T*-1 . E_S

114472:65	What about these telephone callers . Sometimes they 're door-to-door but usually they 're telephone callers \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire . E_S

114825:37	They 're doing research for a lot of big companies from what I understand *T*-1 on this . E_S
114837:15	and get the computer where it recognizes voices *T*-1 . E_S
114840:14	See that 's why \[ I , \+ it 's \] interesting *T*-1 because \[ you have \+ \[ I , \+ I 'm going *-2 to say 0 you have \] \] an accent . E_S

116855:13	and that 's why we decided *-1 to build *T*-2 . E_S
116860:106	and \[ the garages were always , \+ if the house \[ w- , \+ was \] large , it seemed like the garages were \] small even if they were three car garages which *T*-1 is what we have *T*-2 . E_S

117548:40	My husband is a hunter , fisherman , outdoorsman , Marlboro type person who *T*-1 had *-2 to have a sporting dog . E_S
117575:20	You know , course , when he runs around the yard *T*-1 , he just digs , E_S
117582:73	And the worst part that I had *T*-1 with him , \[ he 's , \+ he 's \] three now was when he was , uh , about eight months old *T*-2 E_S
117586:18	and I did not know what * to expect *T*-1 from a dog *-2 having not had one , E_S
117597:35	And so , he said , well , puppies just chew when they 're nervous *T*-1
117607:34	So the last thing 0 he did *T*-1 was , when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard , \[ and \+ \] he dug them all up and brought them to the porch *T*-2 . E_S
117614:12	and every night when he comes home from work *T*-1 , he hugs it and talks to him E_S

117617:24	and that 's why I laughed when they called with the topic *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
117629:14	I got her when I lived in Hawaii *T*-1 . E_S

117889:23	I try *-1 to *?* , whenever I can *?* *T*-2 . E_S
117893:71	\[ that 's , \+ \] \[ y- , \+ \] * count your blessings because uh , it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves *T*-1 . E_S

117914:32	One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick . Which , after awhile I could , you know , take \[ *T*-2 it \+ \] apart in my sleep if I needed *-1 to *?* . E_S
118023:20	it got to the point where I did n't know what *T*-1 was going on *T*-2 E_S

118040:38	\[ I , \+ I 've \] gotten to the point where I do n't change the oil anymore *T*-1 . Only because , N_S
118088:9	Uh , how do you feel about taxes *T*-1 ? E_S
118117:73	I guess 0 they figure 0 they 're going *-1 to make up for all 0 they did n't get *T*-3 when they should have had a budget *T*-2 . E_S
118143:4	Why * bother *-1 working *T*-2 ? E_S
118148:37	Well , they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make *T*-1 . E_S
118182:28	And , uh , they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate *T*-1 . E_S
118186:46	\[ \[ So , \+ and , \] \+ and \] you withhold no matter what you do *T*-1 , E_S
118187:11	they withhold what they 're supposed *-1 to *?* *T*-2
118191:57	so you ought *-2 to be saving up some every month *-3 to make up for all what they should be taking *T*-1 out . E_S
118194:22	so now , you know , when you sign your \[ W-Four form or whatever , \+ W-Two whatever \] that is *T*-1 *T*-2 , then they always say , do you want a extra amount for state . Which *T*-3 is ridiculous , E_S

118236:10	Well , what I believe 0 *T*-1 is one of the major \[ pro- , \+ uh , things \] that *T*-2 is wrong with our public school system is that , um , we do not have enough discipline E_S
118248:10	Uh , when I went to school *T*-1 , I know 0 *T*-3 I was scared to death about *-4 being disciplined *-2 , E_S
118259:83	You know , \[ \[ you just , \+ you did not see , \] \+ I did not see \] anybody in my classrooms , when I was going to school *T*-1 , act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom *T*-2 . E_S

118272:4	What , uh , grade is your daughter in *T*-1 ? E_S
118279:56	and , um , there 's children in her classroom that *T*-1 just totally disrupt the classroom , where the teacher can not teach *T*-2 E_S
118287:7	and when I went to school *T*-1 that just was n't put up with *-2 . E_S
118320:12	Was n't that what part of the lottery is going *-1 to go for *T*-2 , if we approve it ? E_S
118325:14	supposedly that 's what it 's suppose *-1 to go for *T*-2 , E_S
118364:24	\[ I think , \+ with what they have *-1 to work with *T*-2 , I think \] 0 *T*-3 they 're doing a pretty good job right now . E_S
118372:13	But , then , what do I know *T*-1 , E_S
118426:11	I wonder how long it 's going *-1 to be on for *T*-2 . E_S
118443:11	They say what aspect are you worried about *T*-1 , E_S
118515:25	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] how we going *-1 to bring that back together *T*-2 . E_S
118521:22	I think 0 that 's where it stems from *T*-1 , is that
118550:91	Either that or I do n't know if it happened and it was n't as highly publicized as it is *?* now , or \[ what the , \+ what the , \] N_S
118557:50	My mother , well , she 's like seventy-four now . E_S \[ She , \+ when she \] was a young girl *T*-2 , she had a beautiful , beautiful cousin that *T*-1 lived in California , E_S

118770:16	Well , you know who I 'm talking about *T*-1 . E_S
118776:10	anyway , when he came into power *T*-1 , he basically just took everybody 's property , you know , just assigned it to himself . E_S
118807:9	Well , what do you think *T*-1 of , uh , this , uh , U S free trade agreement 0 we 're working on *T*-2 with Mexico ? E_S
118822:203	Mexico , N_S \[ \[ \[ they 're , \+ I know 0 they 're trying , \] \+ they 're really trying , \] \+ the Mexican government is trying *-2 *RNR*-3 , \] E_S and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying *-1 *RNR*-3 to , oh , make themselves Americanized , I guess 0 *T*-4 \[ and , \+ \] uh , which *T*-5 is great because that 's what they basically need *-6 to do *T*-7 .

E_S
118834:93	and \[ there 's , \+ \] the cultural differences \[ \[ is what *T*-1 's , \+ is what *T*-2 's kind of , \] \+ it 's what *T*-3 's really \] hurting , uh , the Mexican people , because they 've had their way of life , E_S
118840:14	* Tell me what you like *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S

118874:10	and then when you get it completely , you know , the shell finished *T*-1 , uh , you still have a lot of stuff 0 *-2 to do *T*-3 inside , E_S
118967:26	So \[ what do you , \+ what kind of hobbies are you \] in *T*-1 ? E_S
118981:50	but , it *EXP*-2 's real hard * to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband *T*-1 , E_S
118986:29	so I 've been librarian all this week , which *T*-1 has been real interesting , E_S
118998:7	and what else do I do *T*-1 , E_S
118999:23	I do lots of cross stitching when I have time *T*-1 E_S
119040:22	I 've been to Telluride which *T*-1 is on the west side and , uh , Copper , E_S
119091:50	and \[ we 've , \+ we have \] been to Whistler in Canada , which *T*-1 is just a marvelous place , E_S
119126:27	Well , my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death *T*-1 . E_S
119130:5	When they 're skiing *T*-1 they 're fearless , E_S
119141:22	Well , I do n't know how much you can learn *T*-1 . E_S
119151:21	Well , it is fun , what little I do *T*-1 . E_S
119154:21	I told my husband last night when I had called and they had , told me that this was a topic *T*-1 ,
119155:32	I said , well , I can tell them how * to fish with a minnow *T*-1 or how * to fish with a worm *T*-2 . E_S
119155:59	I said , well , I can tell them how * to fish with a minnow *T*-1 or how * to fish with a worm *T*-2 . E_S
119163:33	That 's about the only kind 0 I know how * to do *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
119178:10	And then when I get tired of them outwitting me *T*-1 , I fish for catfish E_S
119182:25	and we use worms and shiners , which *T*-1 is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows , E_S
119190:18	It all depends on what I 'm fishing for *T*-1 , and the time of day . E_S
119196:25	and it 's very convenient on afternoons when I want *-1 to just get away and sit and think *T*-2 . E_S
119201:25	and I have a lot of friends who *T*-1 like *-2 to go *-3 fishing . E_S
119207:17	I have a friend who *T*-1 has a little \[ infla- , \+ inflatable \] raft , E_S
119223:51	but unless you have a boat you ca n't really get into \[ the , \+ where they call the \] good fishing holes *T*-1 , you know . E_S
119358:11	That 's what I do *T*-1 a lot . E_S
119364:5	When they first said the subject *T*-1 , my mind went kind of blank . E_S
119372:42	I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] have a friend who , if she likes something , is n't sure what size somebody might need *T*-1 , *T*-2 will buy it in every color and size and , you know , take everything back again . E_S
119372:73	I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] have a friend who , if she likes something , is n't sure what size somebody might need *T*-1 , *T*-2 will buy it in every color and size and , you know , take everything back again . E_S
119379:31	And so I 'm usually , uh , pretty careful when I shop *T*-1 E_S
119424:16	And you usually get what you pay for *T*-1 . E_S
119446:31	\[ you , \+ you \] pretty well know what you 're getting *T*-1 ahead of time , E_S
119451:96	I mean , \[ we , \+ we \] had a car *ICH*-1 once that we tried *-2 to have *T*-3 declared *-4 a lemon under the lemon law which *T*-5 is extremely difficult 0 * to do *T*-6 . E_S
119479:76	\[ I , \+ at first I \] thought of food , you know , because that 's \[ what , \+ mainly what \] I buy *T*-1 , E_S it seems like *T*-2 , E_S
119481:95	\[ but , \+ But \] \[ I , \+ I \] think , too , 0 a lot of people do n't buy their warranties either because they know that when it 's that old *T*-1 they 're going *-2 to buy a new one , E_S
119506:53	\[ Some , \+ I think 0 they more \] of their parts plastic , which *T*-1 , you know , makes things break easier , N_S
119528:59	and I think 0 that certainly makes a difference \[ from , \+ back from \] the time when somebody handcrafted something *T*-1 and , you know , had some pride in it *T*-1 . E_S
119540:34	So , if we get \[ what we \+ what we \] deserve *T*-1 . E_S
119544:117	\[ and that , \+ and uh , uh , you know , \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] \] a real eye-opener as far as , you know , why people charge what they do *T*-1 *T*-3 *-2 to , you know . E_S
119544:128	\[ and that , \+ and uh , uh , you know , \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] \] a real eye-opener as far as , you know , why people charge what they do *T*-1 *T*-3 *-2 to , you know . E_S
119546:36	Well , * let me just start by *-2 asking what you think *T*-1 of this Middle East affair 0 we 've got *T*-3 going on ? E_S
119548:43	I think that it 's time that we concentrate more on what *T*-1 's going on within our own borders than what *T*-2 's going on in the Middle East *T*-3 . E_S
119548:73	I think that it 's time that we concentrate more on what *T*-1 's going on within our own borders than what *T*-2 's going on in the Middle East *T*-3 . E_S
119551:225	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think that , uh , for once , \[ we should , \+ we should n't \] even be \[ at , \+ at \] these Mid East talks because , with the exception of our hostages , \[ we really do n't have too much of a , uh , real in- , \+ we should n't have too much of a real interest \] in * deciding whose land it is *T*-1 . E_S
119557:20	\[ and , \+ and \] what does it cost these people over there *T*-1 , you know . E_S

120759:62	I caught Wolfe with , uh , uh , \[ one , \+ uh , one \] of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents *T*-1 , E_S
120766:11	It 's what they 've done *T*-1 in the spring or the fall . E_S
120822:136	And I said , You know , you need *-1 to either read Neal Sperry 's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery , because lot of places \[ that *T*-2 would , \+ \] are just trying *-3 to sell whatever *ICH*-5 *T*-4 was pretty out there , E_S
120876:4	What did you grow *T*-1 ? E_S
120883:39	and by the fence I had cucumbers , \[ which , \+ which \] *T*-1 did n't do real well , uh E_S
120901:13	Uh , sometimes when I hear \[ \[ what , \+ what \] they 're , \+ \[ even what , \+ even what \] the politicians are \] making *T*-1 *T*-2 , you know , when they 're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that *T*-3 , uh , I think 0 that 's just a bit too much 0 * to be paying them *T*-4 , uh , E_S
120901:78	Uh , sometimes when I hear \[ \[ what , \+ what \] they 're , \+ \[ even what , \+ even what \] the politicians are \] making *T*-1 *T*-2 , you know , when they 're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that *T*-3 , uh , I think 0 that 's just a bit too much 0 * to be paying them *T*-4 , uh , E_S

120903:5	When you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much *T*-1 , it 's just billions of dollars E_S
120903:20	When you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much *T*-1 , it 's just billions of dollars E_S
120908:10	And then when you read about that *T*-2 they 're spending all the money on , you know , these studies that *T*-1 have no relevance whatsoever ,
120913:72	But , uh , \[ somebody , \+ somebody \] was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we 're paying *T*-1 , it 's not that we mind *-2 paying taxes , it 's that we 're paying too much for a lousy government . E_S
120921:19	I 'm not really into what they 're doing *T*-1 per se , E_S

120957:49	but I think , uh , 0 I do n't know \[ what , \+ what \] kind of input we 're going *-2 to get *T*-1 from the public and how they 're going *-3 to go about * doing it *T*-4 . E_S
120957:97	but I think , uh , 0 I do n't know \[ what , \+ what \] kind of input we 're going *-2 to get *T*-1 from the public and how they 're going *-3 to go about * doing it *T*-4 . E_S
120966:62	Well , they got so many hidden taxes , that it *EXP*-1 's really hard * to figure out how much you are paying *T*-2 , because , * go to a grocery store , something like that , and you 're paying a little tax here E_S
120982:18	and I do n't know what our gas tax is *T*-1 . E_S
121003:54	well , I mean , you could tell \[ just by , \+ just by \] how much money you have *T*-1 left *-2 over , E_S
121012:10	Well , how much do you like lawn and garden work *T*-1 ? E_S
121023:4	What do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
121032:14	mostly snow removal , which we 've had a lot of *T*-1 , E_S
121040:29	\[ I have a , \+ uh , when I have an \] area 0 * to do *T*-1 *T*-2 , \[ I , \+ I \] always had a big garden and enjoy *-3 working on lawns \[ and , \+ and \] everything . E_S
121104:5	When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter *T*-1 , you know , \[ and \+ \] their grass is fairly green . E_S
121130:19	But , you know , when you look at the neighborhoods *T*-1 \[ and \+ \] they 're all brown except the one , you know , E_S it 's sort of like , well , . N_S
121141:38	So . I know 0 I was in , uh , Houston when I was working for a company once *T*-1 , E_S
121154:11	that 's where Plano is *T*-1 , E_S
121173:4	What 's your favorite T V show *T*-1 ? E_S

121254:4	What else do you like *T*-1 ? E_S
121272:33	That 's the only one 0 I watch *T*-1 whenever I , oh , N_S
121283:26	I used *-1 to watch GENERAL HOSPITAL when I was a teenager *T*-2 because I , N_S
121285:23	I quit *-3 watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
121290:53	I used *-3 to watch it , \[ was \+ \] in high school and college when Laura 's mother got killed *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
121345:11	that 's how they left the show *T*-1 , but not in real life . E_S
121356:36	so , I do n't watch it everyday like I did when I had babies *T*-1 . E_S
121365:14	I videotape it when I have *-1 to miss it *T*-2 . E_S
121376:84	Now \[ is n't DESIGNING WOMEN , \+ do n't they \] have a new chick *ICH*-2 on there \[ instead of the , \+ instead of \] what 's her name *T*-1 ? E_S
121394:34	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] just know which one she is *T*-1 . E_S
121441:16	The kids already know who it is *T*-1 , E_S
121442:16	I do n't know who it is *T*-1 , though , E_S
121444:4	Who is it *T*-1 ? E_S

121488:38	If you 're having a dinner party , \[ what , \+ what \] would you serve *T*-1 ? E_S
121497:73	And then \[ I would have , \+ um , * let 's see . I usually have \] like a little theme when I have a dinner party *T*-1 E_S
121515:4	How does that sound *T*-1 ? . E_S
121518:24	\[ well , \+ well , \] when is the party here ? . E_S
121540:14	so , um , when we have friends over *T*-1 I have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs E_S
121545:18	so once in a while when we do something like that *T*-1 it 's kind of fun , E_S
121558:11	that 's what \[ they , \+ they \] are shooting for *T*-1 here . E_S
121622:9	and now where are you *T*-1 in New York ? E_S
121635:10	Is that where \[ you , \+ you \] are originally from *T*-1 around there ? E_S
121647:49	Um , well , \[ I like *-2 to have , \+ um , sometimes when I have a dinner party *T*-1 I 'll have , \] um , everybody bring something , E_S
121666:13	do you know what a fajita is *T*-1 ? E_S
121732:56	I think 0 it needs *-1 to be something , uh , uh , a throwback to where they did a , uh , public execution where it 's visible *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
121732:82	I think 0 it needs *-1 to be something , uh , uh , a throwback to where they did a , uh , public execution where it 's visible *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
121736:57	Uh , something , you know , not gruesome E_S \[ but , \+ but \] something more where people know that \[ it , \+ it \] was a deterrent and it was equal for all people *T*-1 . E_S
121770:95	\[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that 's \] a reward uh , for a heinous crime rather than , uh , * having them pay the penalty which *T*-1 is forfeiture of their life . E_S
121835:131	but , uh , repeat , uh , crimes uh , maybe not \[ the , \+ the \] more mild ones but , you know , \[ a \+ \] more severe ones especially \[ on , \+ on \] armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people , and not just taking the money but beating them half to death *T*-1 . E_S
121873:5	What type of things do you feel 0 *T*-1 would invade your privacy every day ? E_S
121875:35	Um , huh . Well , I do n't like it when , uh , people listen to my phone conversations , like if they 're outside my door while I 'm talking in my room *T*-1 , or when people like look through my things in my bedroom *T*-2 . E_S
121875:114	Um , huh . Well , I do n't like it when , uh , people listen to my phone conversations , like if they 're outside my door while I 'm talking in my room *T*-1 , or when people like look through my things in my bedroom *T*-2 . E_S
121885:39	\[ I , \+ I \] find it *EXP*-2 very annoying when I 've worked all day *T*-1 * to come in and my phone to ring constantly ,
121906:18	but I do n't know what *-1 to do *T*-2 *-3 to stop it . E_S
121942:7	Now what can you do *T*-1 *-2 to stop that ? E_S
122003:21	\[ and , \+ and \] when you 're on a conversation *T*-1 instead of *-2 walking off or just making themselves busy , they 'll stand there and listen to what you say *T*-3 until you hang up . E_S
122003:97	\[ and , \+ and \] when you 're on a conversation *T*-1 instead of *-2 walking off or just making themselves busy , they 'll stand there and listen to what you say *T*-3 until you hang up . E_S
122007:28	this lady does that to me at work when I 'm taking an order or something *T*-1 , E_S
122016:28	But , you know , it gets annoying when they stand right over you *-1 watching everything 0 you do *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
122044:22	and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids 0 *T*-1 to bother me , since mine are all grown up *T*-2 , E_S
122048:9	but . What else would *T*-1 be an annoyance ? E_S
122052:8	Especially when you 're in a hurry *T*-1 . E_S
122084:7	so when I first moved here *T*-1 I probably did consider that an invasion of privacy E_S
122085:71	because \[ it , \+ at \] first you 'd hear a lot of noise , especially at night you know , when you go to bed *T*-1 . E_S
122099:64	because \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] remember *-2 waking up in several years at night when I 'd hear a fire truck go by *T*-1 , you know . E_S
122117:5	What else is an invasion *T*-1 ? E_S
122119:19	I had an old boyfriend who *T*-1 looked through my notes one time . E_S
122158:21	Uh , \[ what , \+ what \] are some of the shows that you have been able *-1 to rent *T*-2 *T*-3 though ? E_S
122162:16	Uh , WHITE PALACE which I thought 0 *T*-1 was \[ over rated , \+ over hyped , \] um , recently . E_S
122164:4	What have you seen *T*-1 recently ? . E_S
122174:4	What did you think *T*-1 of that one ? E_S
122191:13	and that 's when the movie was filmed *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
122195:38	and , uh , \[ we , \+ \[ when , \+ when \] the movie came out *T*-1 , we \] went , N_S
122196:31	uh , my dad lives in the state capital , which *T*-1 is Pierre E_S
122225:74	So , \[ I kind of , \+ I think \] 0 I enjoyed it more *ICH*-4 \[ when I , \+ when I \] watched it on video cassette *T*-1 than I did , uh , in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted *-2 every time 0 they 'd say that *T*-3 . E_S
122226:32	I 'd go \[ now , \+ now \] which one could that be *T*-1 you know , E_S
122327:62	And \[ it was , \+ it *EXP*-2 was \] really good * to see all the movies and how the story developed *T*-1 , E_S
122342:16	I 'm not sure where you 're from *T*-1 . E_S
122356:29	And they 're trying *-1 to spend money where we do n't have it *T*-2 E_S
122393:26	A lot has *-1 to do with how the kids were raised *-2 *T*-3 at home . E_S
122398:10	And then when the kids get to school *T*-1 , they try *-2 to take away a lot of things that they can do *T*-3 *-4 to discipline the kids . E_S
122399:31	I mean , they 've so severely limited E_S what disciplinary action you can do *T*-1 . E_S
122403:30	\[ I , \+ I \] know 0 when I , uh , was going to school *T*-1 it *EXP*-3 was n't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that *T*-2 was misbehaving . E_S
122444:27	And they may not know a lot about what they 're teaching *T*-1 . E_S
122445:4	Where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses *T*-1 E_S
122451:4	Where maybe a physics professor , N_S
122460:85	\[ \[ e- , \+ e- , \] \+ maybe \] they should sit back \[ and , \+ and \] kind of , uh , decide on where the money 's best spent *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
122470:7	So when they rebuilt that school *T*-1 , they had \[ a , \+ a \] top of the line , high tech school there . E_S
122475:10	and then when , uh , the evaluation committees came through *T*-1 , they praised the school that *T*-2 had been rebuilt *-3 while they were down grading all these other ones . Telling them what they needed *-4 to do *T*-6 *-5 to fix up this building E_S
122475:106	and then when , uh , the evaluation committees came through *T*-1 , they praised the school that *T*-2 had been rebuilt *-3 while they were down grading all these other ones . Telling them what they needed *-4 to do *T*-6 *-5 to fix up this building E_S
122480:40	Well \[ I , \+ I \] know , uh , 0 where I came from *T*-1 . We did n't have a very , uh , rich community E_S
122495:13	and that 's how I picked up golf *T*-1 . E_S
122522:4	What is your handicap *T*-1 ? E_S
122562:32	and each shot I say , well , this is what I 'm going *-2 to try *-3 to do *T*-1 E_S
122566:16	and then I see how close *ICH*-1 I can come *T*-2 to that . E_S
122582:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
122583:17	\[ I , \+ when I \] used *-1 to golf out there *T*-2 I 'd putt well
122661:37	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know what *T*-1 changed that pattern . E_S
122678:11	that 's what they do *T*-1 here sometimes . E_S
122679:17	You hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there *T*-1 E_S
122745:28	it *EXP*-2 's hard * to imagine what life was like *T*-1 without it now . E_S
122760:31	\[ Wh- , \+ \[ i- , \+ \] what \] would we do *T*-1 without it ? . E_S
122764:4	What did we do *T*-1 without it back then ? E_S
122783:106	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] often pictured , uh , in my mind , you know , \[ what it *EXP*-2 would be like *T*-1 * to just , \+ what would you find *T*-3 if you just \] \[ kept on * going , \+ kept on *-4 going ? \] E_S
122792:5	when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object *T*-2 , and it 's hard 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] see *T*-1 , you know . E_S
122799:19	I always thought well , what do you do *T*-1
122836:22	I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 made us , uh , progress to the state 0 we are *T*-2 is our curiosity . E_S
122864:35	There 's a better way of * doing it than what we are doing it *T*-1 . E_S
122886:40	You know , somewhere they can sit down and write down what , you know , things that you 've improved upon *T*-1 , E_S
122899:21	Well , I do n't know what * to do *T*-1 about the federal budget . E_S
122901:35	and I sort of wondered \[ what your , \+ what \] thoughts you had *T*-1 on that area . E_S
122903:133	\[ The , \+ the \] first one is 0 we need people *ICH*-2 in there \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 understand , uh , numbers . The numbers that *T*-3 are being thrown *-4 around \[ when , \+ when \] we 're talking in trillions of dollars . Uh , which *T*-5 is an astronomical sum *T*-6 E_S

122907:58	\[ and , \+ and \] the people that *T*-1 are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means *T*-2 . E_S
122918:168	\[ \[ Our , \+ our , \] \+ our \] Senate and Congress \[ and , \+ and \] people \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 deal everyday \[ and , \+ and \] what 's *T*-2 going *-3 to be done *-4 with those monies um , and do n't really understand what that is *T*-5 or how a budget even works *T*-6 . E_S

122928:16	I 'm not sure how you would ach- , N_S
122929:4	how would you achieve that *T*-1 ? E_S
122960:59	They make a decision based on \[ consti- , \+ constituency \] instead of a decision based on what they really believe *T*-1 . E_S
122970:36	\[ So , \+ so \] you would favor a law which *T*-1 said 0 there could not be lobbyists . E_S
122983:110	\[ I , \+ I \] think that any company or anything that *T*-1 wants *-2 to contribute to a fund should be able *-3 to do that , and be registered *-4 with what they ever contribute *T*-5 . E_S
122995:5	When you are talking again , uh , billions and trillions of dollars *T*-1 uh , \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] jeopardizing the future of the country , uh , for today . E_S
123020:11	That 's why we have interest *T*-1 . E_S
123026:18	But \[ wha- , \+ what \] practical steps \[ could on- , \+ could one \] take *T*-1 ?
123033:11	and , and how will you , make that actually happen *T*-1 ? E_S
123075:11	That 's what you pay *T*-1 E_S
123093:9	So , who 's your favorite team *T*-1 ? E_S
123101:30	I used *-1 to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little *T*-2 . E_S
123104:5	when John Stallworth played *T*-1 he was from my hometown in Alabama , E_S
123116:44	\[ I , \+ I \] used *-1 to watch them a lot when they were playing the big \[ iron curtain , \+ or steel curtain *T*-2 . \] E_S
123174:32	I mean , you just really ca n't tell what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen . E_S
123203:40	\[ I 'm not sure , \+ I 'm not sure \] who they play *T*-1 . E_S

123216:4	What do you think *T*-1 about , uh , Houston ? E_S
123224:13	Uh , from what I saw *T*-1 they were playing , N_S
123225:5	when I was at the game *T*-1 we sat right on the front row , right behind the Houston Oilers , E_S
123229:10	and from what I saw *T*-1 the game \[ Houston , \+ Houston \] impressed me a lot . E_S
123234:43	and if that was an off night I 'd hate *-1 to see when he 's on a good night *T*-2 . E_S
123253:16	\[ Who , \+ who \] did they play *T*-1 ? E_S
123317:9	Um , what cities are they looking at *T*-1 ? E_S
123323:32	And \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] where I was *T*-1 when I saw , uh , Houston play *T*-2 . E_S
123323:46	And \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] where I was *T*-1 when I saw , uh , Houston play *T*-2 . E_S
123354:7	and when I went up there *T*-1 they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did . E_S
123363:6	So what do you guys having *T*-1 up there ? E_S
123382:6	So what 's it been like *T*-1 up there ? E_S
123453:69	we 're supposed *-1 to have a chance * to get some rain the next couple of days here , uh , which *T*-2 will be , you know , a little bit more typical , uh , autumn weather .
123460:27	you know , the poor trees , said what , E_S
123493:33	I 'm not sure \[ what that , \+ what that \] means *T*-1 . E_S
123557:10	Um , what I notice *T*-1 mostly is the red maples , that the leaves are just dead ,
123594:4	What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S
123654:17	I do n't know who *T*-1 played when and who *T*-2 does what like some guys are *?* . E_S
123654:33	I do n't know who *T*-1 played when and who *T*-2 does what like some guys are *?* . E_S

123677:9	Leslie , what are you studying *T*-1 ? E_S
123691:9	So , what are you planning *-1 to go into *T*-2 ? E_S
123705:11	That 's what my mom does *T*-1 , labor and delivery . E_S
123724:50	She works \[ the , \+ uh , I guess 0 the \] graveyard 's what you 'd call *T*-1 it . E_S
123729:34	And she 's worked that for , oh , years , when I was small *T*-1 . E_S
123739:91	\[ and , \+ uh , and , \] uh , \[ she 's , \+ uh , she just started \] a new job at a different hospital , closer to where she lives *T*-1 E_S
123888:30	\[ I , \+ that 's the main thing when I \] was shopping for one *T*-1 , E_S
123916:56	So the people that *T*-1 move here seem *-2 to move from all over the country , which we 're from , um , *T*-3 the northeast , E_S
123918:33	So it , um , also gives you a common bond when you do n't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors *T*-1 , E_S
123921:54	Well , we also in this area seem *-1 to have a lot of retirees people who *T*-2 do n't want the heat of Florida but do n't want \[ the heat of the , \+ the cold of the \] northeast E_S
123932:45	Now \[ it 's , \+ um , is it \] very wooded around where you are *T*-1 , E_S
123949:105	\[ and , \+ and , \] um , uh , the landscape is much different *ICH*-1 here in Texas than it is *?* , you know , in the north . Um , or even where you are *T*-2 . E_S
124005:50	\[ I , \+ I \] know that \[ the amount of , \+ or how far your \] dollar goes *T*-1 probably more than anything \[ has , \+ has \] greatly changed . E_S
124013:48	and they compared income at different points in time \[ when the , \+ when the \] father \[ was , \+ you know , was \] a little bit younger and more in his heyday *T*-1 E_S
124018:130	And even though the son was probably more successful , you know , higher up in \[ the , \+ the \] management ladder uh , \[ his , \+ he \] was actually making less money \[ when you co- , \+ when you go \] by costs of living *T*-1 . E_S
124028:19	And it 's depending on where you live *T*-1 , though , too . E_S
124053:16	I do n't know what it 's *T*-1 , uh , by you . E_S
124167:15	I guess 0 when I look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms *T*-1 I say God . E_S
124173:9	Well , what 's your favorite baseball team *T*-1 , Rita ? E_S
124176:10	Is that what I- , N_S
124200:4	How do you expect them to do *T*-1 this year ? E_S
124207:4	What did you think *T*-1 of the World Series ? E_S
124211:49	and , uh , in South Dakota , the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where I was living *T*-1 E_S
124233:96	Oh , uh , and I was routing for the Twins myself because , uh , \[ they , \+ \] a couple of Ranger players that I had watched *T*-1 when we first moved here *T*-2 , uh , went to Minnesota , E_S
124241:4	What do you think 0 *T*-1 going *-2 to happen to the Rangers ? E_S
124248:5	When we moved down *T*-1 , uh , I was able *-2 to go to my first , you know baseball game , and thought , this is great ,
124264:7	But when you go to the ball park *T*-1 , it 's really not all that far you know , E_S
124290:17	he does n't know how many years I mean , * to pitch *T*-1 . E_S
124314:6	when he quits at *-1 being active *T*-2 , he will go into , you know * \[ being a , \+ \] managing and , yeah , you know , being a coach , I 'm sure 0 *T*-3 . E_S
124325:75	You know , you like *-1 to have someone like that 0 you could point to *T*-2 say , * see what a fine man , that , he is *T*-3 . E_S
124328:46	like , uh , Ivan Rodriguez was n't even born *-1 \[ when , \+ when , \] uh , Nolan Ryan started *-2 pitching *T*-3 . E_S
124332:70	And it *EXP*-1 's just incredible * to think that \[ there 's , \+ uh , there are \] players who *T*-2 are the sons of ball players that *T*-3 used *-4 to play against Nolan or with Nolan , you know , E_S
124340:40	\[ were you here , \+ had you moved here \] yet when he did the exhibition at U T with his son *T*-1 . E_S
124368:45	Well , the Rangers really , uh , knocked the socks off of them , which you would expect *T*-1 you know , anyway , E_S
124377:7	So what do you , uh , think 0 *T*-1 is \[ the , \+ uh , the \] worst culprit for air pollution ? E_S
124387:102	\[ It 's hurting , \+ you know , it 's hurting \] Germany *ICH*-1 , for example , too , and some other parts of Europe \[ where they , \+ where they \] have high industry *T*-2 . E_S
124392:43	it *EXP*-1 's hard * to put the finger on , uh , what *T*-2 's worse , \[ you \+ know , \] the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion , um , with , uh , your hydrocarbons , uh causing the damage in which , N_S
124418:29	and , you know , \[ how , \+ how \] we are *T*-1 with our love affair with the auto E_S
124427:21	but they had a new policy where in order * to get \[ your , \+ uh , your \] \[ license , \+ uh , your car license , \] uh , renewed *-1 , you had *-2 to meet the pollution standards *T*-3 E_S
124436:29	\[ and , \+ and \] the computer reads whatever the ionization *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 coming out , E_S
124445:16	and as far as where I live *T*-1 , I do n't have *-2 to do that , E_S
124446:22	but I have an old car which I doubt 0 *T*-1 \[ would , \+ uh , would , \] uh , pass the inspection , a seventy-six , E_S
124471:14	those of us who *T*-1 have , N_S
124552:6	And what did you graduate in *T*-1 ? E_S
124575:6	How long of a program is that *T*-1 ? E_S
124609:7	So what is your advice to * picking a college *T*-1 . E_S
124614:37	if you 're going *-1 to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one *T*-3 , I do n't think 0 you 're going *-2 to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you 're down to the thirty to forty to one . E_S
124617:13	Is that , what was yours more like *T*-1 ? E_S
124631:4	Which *T*-1 is , you know , N_S
124634:5	what I thought 0 *T*-1 was nice is 0 \[ you could al- , \+ there was always \] time 0 * to talk to professor , you know *T*-2 , E_S
124643:97	\[ So , \+ but \] \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I 's , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] put that against , uh , my high school where we had , uh , a biology class of three hundred and fifty students *T*-1 E_S
124701:9	Well , what would *T*-1 be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of * attending college ? E_S
124720:30	You know , you get to the point where \[ it 's , \+ I 'm \] never going *-1 to get done *-2 *T*-3 . E_S
124731:51	Even if you do n't have your major decided on * , * have an idea what you think 0 you might want *T*-1 , you know , E_S
124735:8	So how many , um , credit cards do you have *T*-1 ? E_S
124741:10	Is that why you said 0 I had more experience than you *T*-1 ? E_S
124747:21	Well , \[ how , \+ how \] do you use your credit card *T*-1 ? E_S
124764:16	\[ How , \+ how \] do you use it *T*-1 ? . E_S
124813:32	and I was just starting *-1 to get to where it was getting me in trouble *T*-2 E_S
124870:44	I have like a Diner 's Club \[ through my , um , \+ where I \] work *T*-1 E_S
124922:16	\[ what , \+ what \] can you . N_S
124960:5	What kind of car would you like *-1 to buy *T*-2 next ? E_S
124965:9	Well , why would that be *T*-1 ? E_S
124976:67	If you had , uh , no financial requirements , if you could buy any car in the entire world , no matter what it cost *T*-1 , what would you buy *T*-2 ? E_S
124976:82	If you had , uh , no financial requirements , if you could buy any car in the entire world , no matter what it cost *T*-1 , what would you buy *T*-2 ? E_S
124984:5	Which type of Cadillac , uh , is your favorite *T*-1 ? E_S
125011:42	\[ one year they had , \+ a couple years they had \] where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it *T*-1 . E_S
125085:5	What kind of , uh , General Motors cars have you had *T*-1 in the past ? E_S
125093:11	That 's what we have *T*-1 now , E_S
125138:51	That 's always nice * to get , uh , reliability in a product . Especially when you 're spending , you know , anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars \[ for , \+ for \] a single item *T*-1 . You know , E_S
125156:61	but \[ that 's always been something \+ that 's been a key factor \] in me , is how reliable is this car going *-1 to be *T*-2 you know . E_S
125184:30	You know , it 's American made too which *T*-1 is good . E_S
125224:11	you get what you pay for *T*-1 , E_S
125225:38	if we 're going *-1 to have national health insurance , which *T*-2 seems likely , it 's necessarily going *-3 to involve more taxes . E_S
125232:25	and you wonder , you know , where 's it all going *T*-1 E_S
125234:4	Where 's it all going *T*-1 ? E_S
125239:42	But you kind of always wonder , well \[ where 's , \+ where 's \] the money going *T*-1 ? . E_S
125241:97	Well , \[ \[ one , \+ one , \] \+ one \] of the big tax that *T*-1 has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which *T*-2 in principle is going \[ into , \+ into \] a big trust fund , E_S
125252:60	I think 0 Senator Moynihan 's proposal * \[ to , \+ to \] cut the social security tax which *T*-1 is n't really \[ going * to , \+ going *-2 to \] beef \[ \[ up , \+ up , \] \+ up \] the social security program could make a lot of sense . E_S
125258:111	As far as other countries , \[ I 'm not , \+ um , I do n't \] keep up on it too much as to far \[ as what , \+ you know , as what \] they 're do- . N_S
125289:124	I guess 0 this does n't really have *-1 to do with taxes but just money in general , \[ and , \+ and , \] um , * wondering if you 're going *-2 to have enough *ICH*-5 when you retire *T*-3 0 * to live on *T*-4 . E_S
125333:5	when you place a call *T*-1 topic is given *-2 to you . E_S
125338:15	I thought 0 whoever *T*-1 made the call could choose what topic , E_S because I have n't made any calls yet . E_S
125346:61	because \[ it 's kind of a , \+ it can be a \] rather controversial subject depend on who you 're talking to *T*-1 . E_S
125369:43	I have three children , um , \[ two , \+ two \] who *T*-1 are in regular school , uh , eleven year old , an eight year old , E_S
125380:92	Um , some of the qualifications that I look for *T*-1 was \[ that , \+ \] uh , you know , the cost , and , um , exactly what they did *T*-2 , if it was structured or nonstructured , if they had a little academic , um , uh , in there , and , um , you know , um , you know , what the qualifications of the teachers ' were *T*-3 , and if the place was clean and um , the hours E_S
125380:198	Um , some of the qualifications that I look for *T*-1 was \[ that , \+ \] uh , you know , the cost , and , um , exactly what they did *T*-2 , if it was structured or nonstructured , if they had a little academic , um , uh , in there , and , um , you know , um , you know , what the qualifications of the teachers ' were *T*-3 , and if the place was clean and um , the hours E_S
125401:40	and I do n't know if I 'll be doing that or what we 're going *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
125406:30	and our church has a Mother 's Day Out program which they started *T*-1 last year , E_S
125419:13	and that 's where Shannon had started *T*-1 , in a Mother 's Day Out program E_S
125435:32	Um , you know , \[ what , \+ what \] kind of a structure is it going *-1 to be *T*-2 . E_S
125436:10	Um , when your child 's a little bit older , like a three year old *T*-3 you 'd be more concerned with if there 's a type of care that it *EXP*-2 's torture for them to lay down and take a nap *T*-1 . E_S
125444:5	What they do *T*-1 at Shannon 's school is * have a video tape going , E_S
125452:73	So , she does n't have *-1 to necessary take a nap there you know , \[ which *T*-2 is , \+ which *T*-3 is \] nice . Um . E_S
125466:10	And sometimes when the child 's a lot younger *T*-1 , \[ before they 're really , \+ um , before three years old , \] you know , like the church is a good program E_S
125467:65	and sometimes you even consider , um , you know , *-1 having a private person come to your own home when they 're real little *T*-2 \[ or \+ or \] something like that , E_S
125471:46	and another consideration is \[ how many infants or children are they , \+ \] what 's the ratio \[ of , \+ of \] teachers \[ to \+ to children *T*-1 E_S
125492:25	I 'm sure that , um , whatever you decide *T*-1 , you 'll be happy with *T*-2 . E_S
125510:96	but , um , I figure , you know , 0 I 'd probably start *-2 asking around at church because I know 0 they have a limit as to how old they can be *T*-1 \[ before they , \+ you know , before you \] can bring them in . E_S
125523:17	a friend of mine who *T*-1 's a nurse \[ is , \+ was \] telling about a wonderful new place that *T*-2 opened some place \[ in , \+ on \] Fifteenth Street , E_S
125540:25	\[ When they 're , \+ when they 're \] little *T*-1 it *EXP*-2 's almost easier * to leave them because when they 're three and they 're cry *T*-3 , N_S

125683:4	What year is it *T*-1 ? E_S
125687:6	And why do n't you like the Mustang *T*-1 ? E_S
125698:33	Well , you know the old sayings about Fords , what they stand for *T*-1 . E_S
125723:26	Well , \[ what , \+ uh , what \] things do you consider *T*-1 when you buy a car *T*-2 ? E_S
125723:47	Well , \[ what , \+ uh , what \] things do you consider *T*-1 when you buy a car *T*-2 ? E_S
125735:7	especially when you 're in high traffic areas and have *-1 to mess with that all the time *T*-2 . N_S
125740:19	And , you know , when you work nine to five , or eight to five *T*-1 , and you 're in rush hour traffic to and from work , unfortunately *T*-1 . E_S
125768:54	but we bought it in eighty-eight , you know , right at the end of the year when they were trying *-1 to get rid *-2 of them *T*-3 E_S
125773:15	you know , when they 're trying *-1 to get rid *-2 of those cars at the end of the year like that *T*-3 , they really come down on their prices E_S
125779:16	Well , that 's what I 'm paying *T*-1 on mine now . E_S
125783:4	when I bought , E_S
125793:39	But \[ I got it when , \+ I got it when \] the eighty-eights first came out *T*-1 , E_S
125799:10	Well , when our kids were younger *T*-1 we really wanted a two door . E_S
125802:31	and , uh , it *EXP*-2 just happened that when we looked for \[ our , \+ our \] new car *T*-1 , they had a thing going with Oldsmobile E_S
125856:4	How do you feel *T*-1 about your game ? E_S
125864:5	when I go out and play golf *T*-1 it 's usually like \[ at a , \+ at one of these \] par threes that , you know , you , N_S

128010:19	Now \[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 keeps you doing that . E_S
128054:37	Well , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ whenever I \] do it *T*-1 , I feel \[ good . \+ I mean good \] that I have done , good because \[ it 's , \+ it seems \] right and good because it has good effects . E_S

128373:26	I 'm thinking \[ what , \+ what \] problems my children might have *T*-1 in that , uh , E_S
128397:66	Well , course MUMBLEx \[ it , \+ it \] is a big factor in * having an understanding of how much parents will pay *T*-3 and how much *T*-1 has *-2 to come from other sources and your willingness , one , * \[ to , \+ to \] work during the summer \[ or , \+ or \] part time .

128704:42	I mean , you know , there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day *T*-1 . E_S
128710:4	How did , N_S
128711:17	I 've always wondered how he gets around *T*-1 . E_S
128738:11	that 's what I was thinking *T*-1 . E_S
128741:4	what do you feel 0 *T*-1 are some of the main problems ? E_S
128761:49	We 've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff . In Durham , which *T*-1 is right next to Raleigh . E_S
128799:37	Um . Well , here , uh , I 'm not sure how many Dallas has had *T*-1 . E_S
128828:42	I live \[ in a , \+ in a \] town house , which *T*-1 is , you know , N_S
128837:40	Boy \[ that really , \+ that really \] takes someone who *T*-1 is bold * to do that . E_S
128872:39	\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] in a neighborhood where we try *-1 to keep up with everything *T*-2 . E_S
128902:9	So , how is the weather *T*-1 out there ? E_S
128959:17	And it seems like when the winds blow *T*-1 , \[ it 's really , \+ \] it goes right through you . E_S
128965:16	see , that 's how it is *T*-1 in Texas , too E_S
128966:8	because when it 's cold *T*-1 , it 's really cold . E_S
128972:4	What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S
128978:29	So the humidity is I think 0 *T*-2 what *T*-1 does it . E_S
128983:29	Because \[ I , \+ I \] noticed when I got here *T*-1 , too , E_S
128985:5	when it would snow in Texas *T*-1 uh , \[ I would just , \+ I mean we 'd \] be \[ f- , \+ really cold \] E_S

129001:20	\[ But , \+ so \] how long ago did you graduate *T*-1 ? E_S

129048:8	So , what 's the temperature *T*-1 up today over there ? E_S
129060:7	And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah *T*-1 , I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill . E_S
129073:15	So , that 's what we 're not used to *T*-1 . E_S
129082:28	So , did you used *-1 to ski when you were out here *T*-2 ? E_S
129084:4	What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S
129086:24	Did you used *-1 to ski when you were in Utah *T*-2 ? E_S

129135:4	What 's your major *T*-1 ? E_S
129178:9	That what my sister did *T*-1 . E_S
129198:62	Because they , since , uh , stopped that program . I mean , \[ where you can \+ where you can \] get it double pretty easily *T*-1 . E_S
129207:9	Well , how do you feel *T*-1 about capital punishment ? E_S
129221:4	Which *T*-1 is funny because I got called *-2 last night N_S and the topic was , uh , something about juries . E_S
129227:9	Uh , how do I feel about it *T*-1 ? E_S
129237:18	so I do n't know what *T*-1 was decided *-2 . E_S
129251:36	And , uh , he went on *-1 to tell us how they happened *-2 to catch this guy *T*-3 E_S
129292:45	You know , \[ he , \+ he \] has no concept of what he has done *T*-1 . E_S
129297:15	well , N_S from what I can tell *T*-1 .
129314:54	Well , I guess 0 in cases like \[ that , \+ \] you know , where the guy would , obviously , go out and do it again *T*-1 I mean , you 've got *-2 to do something . E_S
129334:25	But , you know at the time when the guy kept *-1 saying could you ever convict someone E_S and do you think 0 you 'd ever know beyond a doubt *T*-2 E_S
129368:38	I guess 0 cases like that , I do n't see why they would n't bring in the new evidence from the other case *T*-1 . E_S
129405:29	and if you 're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment *T*-1 , then you can look at mitigating circumstances . E_S
129435:6	But what is it worth *T*-1 ? E_S
129440:19	Personally I do n't know which I would pick *T*-1 if I had a choice for myself . E_S
129512:49	Well , now , so if you were going *-1 to have a dinner party , what would you make *T*-2 ? E_S
129525:28	Now \[ what is , \+ uh , what is , \] uh , the steamed shellfish 0 you said *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
129529:6	And what would that be like *T*-1 ,
129540:79	So if you have \[ a , \+ a \] dinner party and you 're going *-1 to serve , uh , seafood for supper , what type of , uh , hors d'oeuvres would you serve *T*-2 prior to the meal ? E_S
129554:100	And \[ would you , \+ uh , would it *EXP*-2 \] be appropriate * to , uh , drink \[ with the , \+ \] uh , \[ prior , \+ \] when you have the hors d'oeuvres *T*-1 ? E_S
129560:10	And then when you serve the meal *T*-1 , what type of wine would you have *T*-2 \[ \[ with , \+ uh , with the , \] \+ with \] seafood ? E_S
129560:31	And then when you serve the meal *T*-1 , what type of wine would you have *T*-2 \[ \[ with , \+ uh , with the , \] \+ with \] seafood ? E_S
129587:8	Usually when we have a dinner party *T*-1 , \[ I always , \+ I \] like *-2 to grill . E_S
129606:28	and then , uh , I do n't know what we usually have *T*-1 for dessert . E_S
129608:21	but , uh , that 's what we would do *T*-1 for a dinner party , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
129612:36	But \[ \[ that 's , \+ I guess 0 when you talk about dinner party *T*-2 , that 's probably not , \] \+ uh , that 's more for like \] when friends come over *T*-1 . E_S
129612:104	But \[ \[ that 's , \+ I guess 0 when you talk about dinner party *T*-2 , that 's probably not , \] \+ uh , that 's more for like \] when friends come over *T*-1 . E_S
129637:55	Oh , well , do you work \[ in a , \+ uh , in a \] setting where you , uh , are in the food business *T*-1 ? E_S
129691:37	I guess 0 we 're supposed *-1 to talk about what *T*-2 's being done *-3 about recycling . E_S
129702:16	\[ what , \+ what \] do you do *T*-1 , now ? E_S
129716:26	like it 's about a fifth of what it used *-1 to be *T*-2 E_S
129720:29	so the Boy Scout troop quit *-1 doing it when the City took it over *T*-2 . E_S
129734:18	and I 'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins *T*-1 . E_S
129746:16	Oh , that 's why I asked you *T*-1 . E_S
129841:25	And , uh , I do n't know what they could do more of *T*-1 exactly around here right now other than , uh , N_S
129842:4	what are some of the things 0 they do n't recycle *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
129851:13	and , yet , what am I going *-1 to do *T*-4 when I have a couple double A batteries 0 * to toss *T*-2 out *T*-3 . E_S

129861:11	that 's what *T*-1 happens E_S
129887:10	Uh , when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving *T*-1 and \[ the , \+ uh , the \] truck came by *T*-1 , well , we all ran out *-2 to watch it because , you know , we 'd never really seen it pick up our stuff E_S
129899:31	so I do n't know \[ why , \+ what \] that was reading it for *T*-1 E_S
129907:47	they must be trying *-1 to keep track of , you know , who *T*-2 is doing it , or what , I guess 0 *T*-3 . E_S
129916:17	Ooh , for those who *T*-1 are really cooperating . E_S
129975:18	but , I mean , what would somebody do *T*-1 with them . E_S
129977:9	So , how do you feel about capital punishment *T*-1 ? E_S
130012:28	and everybody knows exactly \[ what , \+ what \] for *T*-1 . E_S
130028:85	so it 's more of the easy way out than * making them pay \[ for the con- , for \[ the \+ you know , what they 've done *T*-1 . \] \] E_S
130075:4	What state are you in *T*-1 ? E_S
130090:16	\[ Where , \+ where \] are you calling from *T*-1 ? E_S

130459:38	It 's like , you know , N_S everybody freaks out when it sn- , N_S
130465:25	so , uh , well , uh , what kind of vacations do you like *T*-1 ? E_S
130494:17	I was just wondering what it was like *T*-1 . E_S
130515:4	Where is that *T*-1 ? E_S
130523:54	And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to *T*-1 where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country , most of them third world countries . And study the language and then do a little service project *T*-2 . E_S
130533:9	So , what did you do *T*-1 when you were in Europe *T*-2 ? E_S
130533:25	So , what did you do *T*-1 when you were in Europe *T*-2 ? E_S
130535:29	Uh , well , see , I went there when I was in high school *T*-1 , actually E_S
130541:4	What did you do *T*-1 on the farm ? E_S
130559:36	And while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who *T*-1 were , uh , staying for their vacation in France in Nantes , which *T*-2 is on the west coast , like right across from England . E_S
130559:80	And while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who *T*-1 were , uh , staying for their vacation in France in Nantes , which *T*-2 is on the west coast , like right across from England . E_S
130563:20	Uh , so , uh , where in France are you *T*-1 , E_S
130572:18	And , uh , um , how long do you plan *-1 to be going for *T*-2 ? E_S
130597:14	And , uh , what else are you planning *-1 to do *T*-2 , if anything ? E_S
130642:4	Where have you gone *T*-1 first ? E_S
130644:22	Oh , \[ g- , \+ where *ICH*-3 have I gone *T*-1 \] that *T*-2 's anywhere . E_S
130654:14	Uh , see , what do we recycle *T*-1 ? E_S
130660:20	and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and , uh , plastic bottles *T*-1 E_S
130688:14	And , uh , when you do that *T*-1 \[ it , \+ it \] basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot . E_S
130711:10	Well , when you buy like , uh , canned drinks and stuff like that *T*-1 , do they charge you for the deposit ? E_S
130721:7	so when you turn in the cans unsmashed *T*-1 , you 're just , like , reimbursed *-2 . E_S
130735:8	Really what *T*-1 happens is 0 we just get a penny a can back \[ off the , \+ off the \] price , if you want *-2 to think of it that way . E_S
130739:7	So when we get like , uh , uh , a twelve pack *T*-1 , then that 's like twelve cents back . E_S
130762:45	and they 're not reimbursed *-1 by \[ the , \+ the \] people who *T*-2 are over them or something . E_S
130764:18	Well , shoot , maybe what we ought *-1 to do *T*-2 is *-1 start *-3 sending unsmashed , uh , Pepsi cans and whatever up there . E_S
130779:17	\[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 really works , uh , at least down here is , \[ if there is , \+ if there is \] \[ some , e- , \+ even some \] money 0 * basically to take care of the gas 0 * to recycle it *T*-4 *T*-5 , you know what I mean *T*-2 , then people tend *-3 to do it .
130837:7	and what you 're going *-1 to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever , anyways , you can get a little bit of money for *T*-2 . E_S
130857:26	\[ what part of t- , \+ what part of the \] country do you live in *T*-1 ? E_S

130931:16	This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia , Skillman cross *T*-1 . E_S
130979:40	so \[ I do n't \+ I do n't \] even know how high those go *T*-1 , E_S
130989:67	So , \[ it 's , \+ that 's \] the strange thing about , I guess , Dallas because back where I 'm from *T*-1 , you would n't have that sort of a variation at all . E_S
130998:12	but , exactly what you 're describing *T*-1 is what *T*-2 happens all over . E_S
130998:32	but , exactly what you 're describing *T*-1 is what *T*-2 happens all over . E_S
131063:17	\[ I , \+ where I \] live *T*-1 is a house that *T*-2 's seventeen years old when I bought it *T*-3 . E_S

131083:4	What changes do you feel 0 *T*-1 have happened ? E_S
131138:25	and I do n't know , uh , what the status *ICH*-1 is *T*-2 on it , E_S
131162:7	but when I was employed *-1 with the school district *T*-2 , I did n't have maternity leave either E_S
131182:16	and that 's usually how it 's , uh , happened *T*-1 , E_S
131190:4	What do you see , uh , *T*-1 changing in the future ? E_S
131263:36	And , uh , I 'm not capable of *-2 lifting what , uh , a man can lift *T*-1 and you know , \[ that type of , \+ that type of \] thing , E_S
131282:25	\[ Is , \+ is \] that what you 're talking about *T*-1 , women working out of their homes ? E_S

131378:4	How old are your kids *T*-1 ? E_S
131406:4	when the holidays , N_S
131431:11	That 's what my mother said *T*-1 one time . E_S
131435:7	because who *T*-1 says that they just must got *-2 to come over *-3 to see us all the time for the holidays . E_S
131468:4	How did they end up so far away *T*-1 ? E_S
131507:11	that 's where they 've gone *T*-1 *-2 to make their homes . E_S
131547:7	and when you 're saying older *T*-1 , we 're talking fifty up . E_S
131579:26	I mean , I do n't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen *T*-2 *T*-1 . E_S
131579:46	I mean , I do n't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen *T*-2 *T*-1 . E_S
131588:11	we know what we 're wanting *-1 \[ to , \+ to , \] uh , study *T*-2 E_S
131614:11	We know what we can do *T*-1 . E_S
131623:31	And so \[ the second question , \+ * forgot what the second question , \] E_S
131625:4	What was it *T*-1 , uh , E_S
131626:16	\[ h- , \+ what \] do the trends in families E_S

131688:49	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 I played better golf *ICH*-3 when I was fifteen *T*-1 , John , than I play *?* right now . E_S
131711:43	I mean , I was raised *-1 by a man , my stepfather who , with a two handicap , I mean , \[ \[ \[ he , \+ he , \] \+ he , \] \+ *T*-2 he \] could get down on his knees and hit the ball , I mean , further than most people could hit it . E_S

131726:11	That 's what it takes *T*-1 , E_S
131732:17	I have a brother-in-law who *T*-1 is , uh , an ex-college coach and like a pro E_S
131793:7	and when I am doing that *T*-1 , uh , and feeling loose \[ and , \+ \] that I swing better , E_S

131815:5	when I do swing *T*-1 it 's an easier swing E_S

132041:6	And where are they at *T*-1 ? E_S
132043:18	Uh , do you know where , uh , Custer is *T*-1 ? E_S
132062:11	I know where you mean *T*-1 . E_S
132101:5	when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys *T*-1 , I 'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems . E_S
132106:33	So \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know where those guys are at *T*-1 these days . E_S
132135:19	I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed , the three eighty-six *T*-1 . E_S
132147:17	\[ it , \+ when it \] comes on the manufacturing floor *T*-1 it 's about ten bucks . E_S
132156:4	what do you think *T*-1 about , uh , the self insurance business ? E_S
132169:36	Well , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] understand what you 're saying *T*-1 , E_S
132172:10	However , when \[ a , \+ anybody \] ca n't police their own profession *T*-1 , it eventually leads to that , E_S
132185:31	What about , you know , you know how expensive new equipment and technology is *T*-1 . E_S
132186:11	That 's where I think 0 most of the cost is coming *T*-1 . E_S
132190:33	but , uh , my wife this last summer , uh , when we were on vacation *T*-1 tore up her knee , E_S
132196:22	we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened *T*-1 E_S
132205:35	he says , well , I think 0 this is what it is *T*-1 , E_S
132227:16	I do n't know what it is *T*-1 , E_S
132233:31	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't care what anyone says *T*-1 . E_S

132257:21	but there was a , deal where a doctor was going *-1 to be sued *-2 for malpractice on the death on an infant *T*-3 . E_S
132293:66	there is , uh , uh , girl that *T*-1 went through our school district , I teach in Highland Park who , uh , *T*-2 does aerobics at \[ \[ the Y C A \+ and I say Y , \] \+ the Y W C A \] E_S

132421:26	It is really hard with our life style when you work *T*-1 to , E_S
132493:16	and then it got where we were n't beginning *-1 to get out money 's worth *T*-2 . E_S
132511:58	and \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year . Which *T*-1 is bad . E_S
132528:21	And if you have somebody who *T*-1 will do it with you , N_S
132573:127	Well , I think \[ that , \+ uh , that \] the problem with the sales tax , of course , is 0 it 's an unfair tax across the board , uh , as far as ability * to pay , which \[ \[ a- , \+ allegedly , \] \+ allegedly \] taxes are supposed *-1 to be directed *-2 towards *T*-3 . E_S
132575:7	and where people that make , you know , two hundred , three hundred thousand dollars a year *T*-3 , certainly a portion of that , they are n't going *-4 to be paying taxes on *T*-5 , you know . E_S
132587:5	whatever they spent it on *T*-1 , they have *-2 to pay tax on *T*-3 . E_S
132595:16	\[ Wha- , \+ what \] do you think *T*-1 of that new luxury car tax , anything over ten \[ thou- , \+ or thirty thousand \] dollars ? E_S

132628:7	And where you exempt things , like , uh , uh ,
132641:45	So that 's a lot of the games that politicians play *T*-1 on where they want *-2 to go *T*-4 , you know , *-3 tax things that they do n't , you know , to a degree ,
132648:4	What are you guys having *T*-1 for Christmas ? E_S
132650:4	What are we having *T*-1 ? E_S

132917:4	What do you have *T*-1 now ? E_S
132939:7	So what car do you drive *T*-1 ? E_S
132940:4	What is it *T*-1 ? E_S
132968:36	you get a little more control over \[ when \+ when \] it 's doing the things 0 it 's doing *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
132973:21	Uh , \[ what , \+ what \] rental agent did you go to *T*-1 \[ * to actually rent \+ *-2 to rent \] those kind of cars . E_S
133010:27	* Work for T I . Uh-huh , which *T*-1 is how I heard about this *T*-2 . E_S

133110:99	but , you know , if I had *-1 to make the choice again , \[ \[ I , \+ yeah , I , \] \+ I 'm \] perfectly happy with what I decided *T*-2 um , although we did just buy another car , E_S
133178:4	How did it go for you *T*-1 ? E_S
133184:24	I mean , that 's exactly what it is *T*-1 , you know , E_S
133206:16	Well , that 's what my husband thinks *T*-1 about my car now , that he 's had the Legend E_S
133224:7	MUMBLEx How big is Provo *T*-1 ? E_S
133293:18	so I do n't know how they expect them to , uh , pass history *T*-2 when they ca n't read anything , you know , even read a word problem in math *T*-1 . E_S

133301:22	So \[ do you , \+ what *ICH*-2 do you \] think 0 *T*-1 is good about the schools ? E_S
133304:19	well , it depends on where you are *T*-1 . E_S
133311:15	I mean , what they 'd be teaching *T*-1 in an Arlington school they may not be teaching *T*-2 in a Plano school E_S
133326:22	It depends on , uh , what school you 're in *T*-1 and who your teacher is *T*-2 , actually E_S
133326:43	It depends on , uh , what school you 're in *T*-1 and who your teacher is *T*-2 , actually E_S
133330:10	or is how you end up *T*-1 . N_S
133332:26	so I guess 0 we lucked out when we moved here *T*-1 . E_S
133340:24	and , uh , you know , where our kids might be in a great school *T*-1 , we 're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who *T*-2 are on welfare and unemployment because they ca n't read , you know . E_S
133340:88	and , uh , you know , where our kids might be in a great school *T*-1 , we 're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who *T*-2 are on welfare and unemployment because they ca n't read , you know . E_S
133352:63	because sometimes , like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that *T*-1 did n't even learn what , uh , N_S they should *?* *T*-2 *-3 to do the work that she is supposed *-4 to teach *T*-5 , you know . MUMBLEx and according to her plan , E_S

133508:4	What are some of the other questions *T*-1 . E_S
133543:10	but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom *T*-1 , that 's AIDS E_S
133581:44	Um , I 'm not really , uh , sure that I even understand why the administration is proposing , for instance , tax reductions *T*-1 , because it seems to me that \[ \[ if , \+ if , \] \+ if \] they 're talking about * reducing , uh , the tax that *T*-4 needs *-2 to be paid *-5 , or the tax that *T*-3 's currently being paid *-6 , then \[ that ca n't , \+ it seems to me 0 it ca n't \] possibly , you know , help with \[ the , \+ the \] deficit picture . E_S
133598:52	my understanding is 0 \[ what they 're try- , \+ \[ what , \+ what \] supposedly they 're trying \] *-1 to do *T*-3 by *-4 reducing taxes is * to kind of jump start the economy , the idea being that if people have *-2 to pay less money in taxes , they 'll have more money 0 * to spend *T*-5 , uh , E_S

133661:35	Oh , \[ I see , \+ I see \] what you 're saying *T*-1 . E_S
133673:28	\[ but , \+ but \] *-2 taking what you 're saying *T*-1 at face value , then I would have *-2 to agree with completely . E_S
133681:9	Well , how did it go *T*-1 ? E_S
133683:95	Well , it went pretty well , uh , other than the fact that we encountered some , uh , problems that you run across *T*-1 in older homes with plumbing , which one thing led to another *T*-2 , E_S
133684:60	and eventually we ended up *-1 replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain . Which *T*-2 meant 0 you needed *-3 to take the wall out and start all over . E_S
133721:11	That 's what *T*-1 drove me bananas , because , you know , I 'm going to the hardware store *-2 saying * give me plastic pipe \[ and \+ and \] cement 0 * to fit them together *T*-3 E_S
133741:56	\[ Fortunately , \+ I was very fortunate , \] uh , in the fact that , uh , when I made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on *T*-2 nothing leaked , E_S

133881:28	Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats *T*-1 . E_S
133889:52	one of them was just a \[ different color , \+ different color \] pink , is what it ended up *-1 being *T*-2 . E_S
133895:5	When you did your papering *T*-1 did you start in the middle of the wall ? E_S

133968:22	Well , \[ when , \+ when \] I was in school *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ um , I \] was a communications major , E_S

134124:5	why I 'm not sure 0 I want *-1 to buy a Honda *T*-2 , is because I have *-3 to make a kind of \[ a , \+ a \] steady , um , trip down the road about once a month , because I 'm divorced E_S
134148:208	\[ and , \+ uh , so \] * having precious cargo in the car with me , as you can well imagine , it *EXP*-3 's very hard for me to imagine \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , a Honda 's going *-1 to be as safe a car \[ as , \+ as \] the one that I 've got my eye on *T*-2 , which *T*-4 is a Volvo .

134735:28	So you never know \[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 may occur , E_S
134759:7	but when they start *-1 showing the drawings and all that *T*-2 , I 'm sure , you know , 0 when they , N_S

134874:14	but , uh , when my wife and I first moved in *T*-1 , it was just the two of us . E_S
134879:39	Uh , and it 's , uh , I guess 0 *T*-2 what they call *T*-1 a story and a half . E_S Because it 's not a full two story . Where , you know , everything on top is on bottom *T*-1 . E_S

135938:13	In fact , where I grew up *T*-1 we were about an hour 's drive from seven to , uh , twelve different major ski resorts , E_S

138076:7	Then how does he like it *T*-1 ? E_S
138090:4	How big of a school is it *T*-1 ? E_S
138118:21	and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called *T*-1 reach *T*-2 * was still a pull out one day program . E_S
138118:32	and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called *T*-1 reach *T*-2 * was still a pull out one day program . E_S
138123:46	I thought 0 he needed *-1 to be exposed *-2 to a situation where he could push ahead , uh , every day . But yet still be with his peers age wise *T*-3 . E_S
138156:34	We would n't have thought of *-1 crossing a teacher when we were in school *T*-2 . E_S
138191:9	Well , how do you think that that 's happened *T*-1 ? E_S
138218:50	I mean , I remember , uh , well , 0 it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi 's *T*-2 . E_S
138232:7	And when it was skirts *T*-1 , it was like , * get down on the floor E_S
138250:26	They say 0 you kind of act how you 're dressed *-1 *T*-2 a little bit , E_S
138261:31	they do not do uniforms , although one , where he was *T*-1 between like second and eighth grade did . E_S
138272:5	What kind of woodworking do you do *T*-1 ? E_S

138346:23	I guess 0 dado joints is what it 's called *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
138371:7	But what I need *T*-1 next is a good table saw . E_S

138406:22	\[ where , \+ uh , where \] we lived *T*-1 before up north , uh basements \[ were , \+ were \] common E_S

138497:4	How was it *T*-1 ? E_S
138511:37	and , uh , I did n't notice it until this summer when I was working with her *T*-1 that she would bend her wrist all the way , oh , not in a natural \[ sh- , \+ form . \] E_S
138566:124	Well , one thing that *T*-1 's kind of different , too , though , a preschool \[ than , \+ than \] * taking \[ a , \+ a \] infant \[ or \+ \] to at a day-care where they 're taken care of *-2 *T*-3 . N_S

138669:21	I think 0 that 's what the subject is about *T*-1 . E_S
138690:33	So we live in a society *ICH*-2 , though , where everyone if you ask them on polls , will , uh , say that they think that everyone has a right to health care *T*-1 . E_S
138694:42	And yet , I do n't think 0 we 've ever quite decided who *T*-1 's really supposed *-2 to pay for it . E_S

138727:4	How was your care at Parkland *T*-1 ? E_S
138774:79	and I feel very strongly about , uh , children , and , uh , developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year .

138830:8	From what I 've seen *T*-1 on the news , there 's \[ a , \+ a \] pretty good size problem with poor accuracy , poor procedure in , uh , drug testing . E_S
138835:23	Uh , there have been people who *T*-1 have been turned down *-2 for jobs because there was a drug showed * up \[ in their , \+ in their , \] uh , test , E_S
138836:24	but they did n't know for sure what it was *T*-1 , E_S

140107:36	and we have \[ a , \+ a \] cat , which *T*-1 is , uh , I guess about five years old . E_S
140119:5	what kind of birds do you have *T*-1 ? E_S
140199:9	So , when the guy came over *T*-1 , he was infatuated *-2 by that skunk , E_S

140627:19	Well , like , um , how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood *T*-1 ? . E_S

141124:16	I do n't know how , N_S

142097:15	I find that when I ride in a cart *T*-1 , I play better E_S
142125:16	Well , the reason why we play over there *T*-1 is because it 's where , since we are a Garland resident , they gave us a special deal where you can get , uh , ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars *T*-2 , E_S

142345:14	we did it when we were kids *T*-1 E_S
142418:36	But , uh , you know , right now , uh , what we did *T*-1 , my wife and I , is 0 we got a mobile home . One of these twelve by forty-eight 's that *T*-2 got repoed *-3 , And , uh , swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring 0 I would build a house some day , you know . E_S
142440:13	And I said where . E_S
142514:56	And she made a deal *ICH*-3 with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went *-2 dog showing *T*-1 . E_S
142573:125	But \[ I get , \+ I have \] that problem with \[ the \+ the \] ceiling , you know , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] \[ blown , \+ blown , \] ceiling . You know where you get around the edge *T*-1 . E_S
142579:28	Now , I asked Janice , or somebody recently how you do that *T*-6 uh , when you paint the ceilings *T*-5 you know where you have got that textured stuff , that they have special rollers that *T*-1 are real soft and furry that you paint *T*-3 that with *T*-2 *T*-4 . E_S
142579:50	Now , I asked Janice , or somebody recently how you do that *T*-6 uh , when you paint the ceilings *T*-5 you know where you have got that textured stuff , that they have special rollers that *T*-1 are real soft and furry that you paint *T*-3 that with *T*-2 *T*-4 . E_S
142579:77	Now , I asked Janice , or somebody recently how you do that *T*-6 uh , when you paint the ceilings *T*-5 you know where you have got that textured stuff , that they have special rollers that *T*-1 are real soft and furry that you paint *T*-3 that with *T*-2 *T*-4 . E_S
142587:9	Well , how do you get the edge though *T*-1 ? E_S
142589:4	How do you get the edge *T*-1 ? E_S
142635:4	What color did you paint *T*-1 , E_S
142646:4	What color did you paint your house *-2 *T*-1 ? E_S
142665:13	and that is what he , N_S
142695:4	what do you call those things *T*-1 ? E_S
142700:8	those where you built like a rafter thing *T*-1 . E_S
142702:31	Oh , oh , oh , oh , I know what you are talking about *T*-1 .
142735:26	Oh , I think 0 that is what we might have *-1 to do *T*-2 with this chimney , E_S
142743:5	How much did it cost you *T*-1 for the paint for the outside ? E_S
142768:26	And , anyway , \[ he , \+ when he \] checked out *T*-1 and he was using his MUMBLEx charge card too . They only charged him for one gallon of paint .
142791:7	and when he got outside *T*-1 , he noticed 0 his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something . E_S
142841:4	where do you think 0 they 're headed *T*-1 , E_S
142849:4	What are your thinkings on what they can do *T*-1 , what they 'll be able *-2 to do *T*-3 *T*-4 ? E_S
142849:21	What are your thinkings on what they can do *T*-1 , what they 'll be able *-2 to do *T*-3 *T*-4 ? E_S
142849:40	What are your thinkings on what they can do *T*-1 , what they 'll be able *-2 to do *T*-3 *T*-4 ? E_S
142887:40	I think 0 they should , uh , uh , pay him what his salary is going *-1 to be *T*-2 , uh , and let him , N_S
142907:17	but you know , what , he , N_S
142929:9	Well , what do you think *T*-1 of Howse , who *T*-2 is the coach for the pitchers ? E_S
142929:34	Well , what do you think *T*-1 of Howse , who *T*-2 is the coach for the pitchers ? E_S
142944:31	I mean , he seemed *-1 to know what he was doing *T*-2 E_S
143003:10	Well , what kind of vacations do you like *-1 to take *T*-2 ? MUMBLEx . E_S
143016:4	Where have you gone *T*-1 there ? E_S
143033:4	Where have you been *T*-1 ? E_S
143046:24	but , \[ I , \+ once when I \] had a chance *ICH*-1 in France * to go on vacation *T*-3 instead of *-2 travelling around France I went to Germany E_S
143248:4	How did you like Africa *T*-1 ? E_S
143276:57	So I was doing linguistic work actually , travelling around , finding out about languages , and uh , what they call *T*-1 survey work . E_S
143283:14	* Find out where the languages are *T*-1 . E_S
143299:67	\[ \[ I 've , \+ I 've always , \] \+ um , I 've \] talked to people who *T*-1 have been to Africa , E_S
143343:27	and it 's in Richardson , Texas , which *T*-1 is \[ north Texas \+ or north Dallas . \] E_S
143374:41	Are you finding it *EXP*-1 tough * trying * to find what you want *T*-2 E_S
143382:44	and , uh , you know , everybody says , you know , how many houses *T*-1 are on the market and all that kind of thing E_S
143388:51	and you can cut , you know , the listings , uh , in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms *ICH*-1 *T*-2 you know , or five . E_S
143547:10	So . What kind of business are you in *T*-1 ? E_S
143558:16	\[ What , \+ who \] are you with *T*-1 ? E_S
143572:16	\[ How , \+ how \] was the , uh *T*-1 , N_S
143577:4	How did that compare with this area *T*-1 as far as \[ house- , \+ housing \] prices ? E_S
143583:5	When we moved from Louisiana to Denver *T*-1 , it *EXP*-2 was astounding , you know , * to find that prices were , oh , I guess almost two or three times as high as we 'd expected *?* . E_S
143630:127	At any rate , uh , the topic is fascinating because one of the things 0 I 've done *T*-1 for the past few years is , uh , research the problem from the point of view of , uh , uh , what *T*-2 appears *-4 to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically *T*-3 . E_S
143630:156	At any rate , uh , the topic is fascinating because one of the things 0 I 've done *T*-1 for the past few years is , uh , research the problem from the point of view of , uh , uh , what *T*-2 appears *-4 to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically *T*-3 . E_S
143640:26	And , uh , \[ what , \+ what \] it involves *T*-1 , basically , is the use of peer groups E_S
143658:126	and , uh , I think 0 certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research , uh , uh , of the sort that people like me do *T*-3 * looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used *-1 *-1 to improve performance , particularly , uh , accelerate \[ the , \+ the \] pace of learning *T*-2 . E_S
143663:16	I do n't know what form it will ultimately take *T*-1 . E_S
143664:88	Uh , uh , but , I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we 're paying an enormous price for , uh , inferior quality when the people involved really are n't inferior *T*-1 , E_S
143668:11	I see what year saying *T*-1 , E_S
143673:10	but clearly what *T*-1 's happened in this country is 0 the school system 's been asked *-2 to assume a great many responsibilities *ICH*-3 in the past thirty years that *T*-4 were n't existent , uh , E_S
143682:30	I do n't know \[ how hard , \+ how hard \] is it *T*-1 , uh , in the public school system in Iowa City ? E_S
143690:113	and , uh , people there were saying that the way that the schools were going *T*-1 , a lot of people were going away and going to private schools , or else going to home , where they taught their kids at home *T*-3 . Or , you know , anything but the public schools and the ones that *T*-2 did have , you know , the kids , E_S
143700:22	Well , Utah 's a place where you would n't think 0 that problem would be very severe *T*-1 . E_S
143702:58	but a lot of schools had a lot of transient , uh , families and a lot of families who *T*-1 were on the poorer side E_S
143709:26	I mean , like you said , how \[ they were , \+ the schools \] are doing more things for the kids , they thought 0 *T*-2 , than they were *?* thirty years ago *T*-1 . E_S
143729:4	how do you use them *T*-1 ? E_S
143741:55	Uh , but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher \[ when , \+ when \] you start *-1 using more than a few *T*-2 E_S
143755:30	and , uh , I hate *-1 writing checks when you go *-2 shopping *T*-3 . E_S
143801:23	and we keep on top of what we 're spending *T*-1 . E_S
143803:47	Well , the interest rates in credit cards is so high *ICH*-2 now compared to what your savings is bringing *T*-1 . E_S
143811:11	that 's what I feel *T*-1 . E_S
143820:44	I try *-1 to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill 's going *-2 to come *T*-3 , E_S
143846:46	and then I went and looked \[ and , \+ \] *-1 to see what my visa was *T*-2 E_S
143862:19	I 'm not even sure what their interest rate is *T*-1 since I pay it off E_S
143873:25	And there 's no annual service fee , which *T*-1 is good . E_S
143984:111	Well , as far as I 'm concerned \[ and \+ \] it 's probably apt that your call 's at this time because we just got through *-2 watching , uh , REASONABLE DOUBTS . Which *T*-1 had a , you know , capital case in it . E_S
144044:17	so we can do whatever the hell we want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
144081:90	because \[ I , \+ you know , if \] somebody has been convicted *-1 and has been sentenced *-1 *-1 to be put *-2 to death , how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of \[ ex- , \+ execution *T*-3 ? \] E_S
144088:32	\[ Th- , \+ that \] goes back to when , uh , America was \[ a , \+ a \] colony of England *T*-1 . E_S
144130:19	He was too far away when it happened *T*-1 . E_S
144151:4	What do you think *T*-1 about , uh , uh , convicted , uh , N_S
144158:74	Uh , in fact \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the Bulls were ahead \[ when I , \+ uh , when I \] left *T*-1 . E_S
144159:4	Who *T*-1 won the game ? E_S
144204:83	and I think 0 they look like , uh , they 'll repeat , although , uh , here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelson 's done *T*-1 with the Warriors . E_S
144220:53	now , \[ I do n't , \+ uh , I have n't \] kept up with what *T*-1 was going on \[ with , \+ uh , with \] the , N_S
144224:24	One of the two , uh , who , *T*-1 along with , uh , Chris Mullen was , you know , N_S
144239:48	and , uh , I think 0 that will be real interesting * to see what they can do *T*-1 . E_S
144262:98	and , uh , you know , \[ they 're going , \+ \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 they 're going \] for an all time record of how many \[ l- , \+ you know , losses \] in a row \[ \[ they can , \+ they c- , \] \+ they can , \] uh , pull *T*-1 out . E_S
144268:4	How do people in Texas deal with Dallas , Houston and San Antonio *T*-1 . E_S
144356:17	I do n't know who *ICH*-2 *T*-1 would meet them in the west . E_S
144357:21	Uh , I do n't know how good Portland will turn out *-1 to be *T*-2 by the end of the year . E_S
144360:4	Who *T*-1 won that Portland game ? E_S
144371:14	Well , Michael , what do you think *T*-1 about , uh , funding for AIDS research ? E_S
144387:10	Uh , when they asked us \[ did , \+ did \] we want *-7 to , uh , keep it the same or , uh , spend more , spend less *T*-1 , \[ I think \+ uh , I think \] 0 right now what they 're spending *T*-2 is adequate . Uh , \[ my , \+ for my \] personal opinion . Uh , because I think 0 it 's something that *T*-3 's going *-4 to take them a while 0 *-6 to come up with a , uh , vaccine for *T*-5 . E_S
144387:140	Uh , when they asked us \[ did , \+ did \] we want *-7 to , uh , keep it the same or , uh , spend more , spend less *T*-1 , \[ I think \+ uh , I think \] 0 right now what they 're spending *T*-2 is adequate .

144412:36	Well , I guess 0 I 'm not too aware of how much they 're spending *T*-1 right now . You know . E_S
144432:11	you know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
144440:79	Uh , \[ if , \+ if \] we were talking about the money , uh , I 'd just have *-1 to say 0 what they 're spending *T*-2 is probably enough , simply because I do n't know that much about it . You know . E_S
144508:26	And , uh , because you never know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen . E_S
144509:16	You do n't know who you 're going *-1 to come across *T*-2 , you know . E_S
144582:4	what do you think *T*-1 about that ? E_S
144625:39	Uh , course , there 's so many things in the world where , if you solve one problem , you may be creating another *T*-1 , you know . E_S
144629:69	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] I guess 0 you just have *-1 to take the two problems and see which *T*-2 is worse . Which *T*-3 is the most important 0 * to solve *T*-4 at the time E_S
144629:85	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] I guess 0 you just have *-1 to take the two problems and see which *T*-2 is worse . Which *T*-3 is the most important 0 * to solve *T*-4 at the time E_S
144641:41	\[ But , \+ uh , but \] I 've never looked into how much money they 're spending *T*-1 . E_S
144662:18	and , Mostly that 's what I 've heard *T*-1 , E_S
144790:67	Well , I was thinking , 0 if you 've been there that long , you 've seen Plano grow from what *T*-1 was really \[ a , \+ a \] small town to a city . E_S
144833:23	I do n't know , uh , how a few bucks can be worth * shooting somebody *T*-1 E_S
144843:17	But I guess 0 when people do those things *T*-1 , they do n't really give a thought of the consequences at the time . E_S
144859:16	I did n't know what I was doing *T*-1 . E_S
144867:45	and \[ I think 0 people , \+ uh , I think 0 when you \] have haves and have nots *T*-6 , you 're always going *-1 to find people that *T*-2 are too lazy *-3 to figure a way 0 * to earn money *T*-7 and find 0 it *EXP*-8 's easier *ICH*-9 if you can get a gun * to go out and hold something up than it *EXP*-5 is *?* * to figure out a way 0 * to legitimately earn the money *T*-4 . E_S
144882:4	Where do you work *T*-1 ? E_S
144884:18	Uh , do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are *T*-1 ? E_S
144939:60	Well , they 've entered the work force more , uh , you know , since World War Two is when they started *T*-1 . E_S
144946:15	You know , where I 've noticed it more *T*-1 , I think 0 *T*-2 , is , N_S
144957:68	and , you know , \[ it 's a , \+ it 's a \] credit to them as far as how they 're doing things *T*-1 . E_S
144978:68	every once in a while you read in the newspaper *RNR*-3 or you 'll see it on T V or something *RNR*-3 where the discussion comes out that , you know , women are paid *-1 less than men *T*-2 E_S
145042:21	and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel . Uh , can her makeup come off the upholstery *T*-1 . E_S
145081:5	What kind of work do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
145087:31	And I work at Medical Treatment Center , uh , which *T*-1 is at \[ Garl- , \+ uh , Jupiter \] and Arapaho . E_S
145095:27	Well , * trying *-2 to think what else I can say *T*-1 in regards to this subject . E_S
145110:40	You think about this \[ when you come to , \+ when it comes to \] a subject like that *T*-1 E_S
145122:51	and we went through the process of *-1 searching for child care and uh , finding what we consider *T*-2 to be , real good child care at a , uh , pretty reasonable price , we think . E_S
145147:4	Where are a student *T*-1 ? E_S
145166:115	actually spring semester a year from now he 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be in child care \[ f- , \+ uh , five \] days a week more than likely . Uh , depending on how my class schedule runs *T*-3 E_S
145178:15	So , depending on what my class schedule looks like *T*-1 , he may spend \[ four , \+ \[ si- , \+ \] anywhere from four *RNR*-2 \+ \] to eight *RNR*-2 hours a day in child care at that point . E_S
145183:37	You know , E_S once a day this overlap *ICH*-1 happens where we ca n't , one of us be home *T*-2 . E_S
145202:7	and what we found , uh , *T*-1 to be the best guide was our own instincts about , people who *T*-2 were going *-3 to be loving E_S
145202:62	and what we found , uh , *T*-1 to be the best guide was our own instincts about , people who *T*-2 were going *-3 to be loving E_S
145248:20	and , and that 's really what we 've learned *T*-1 about it . E_S
145255:16	I do n't know what it 's like *T*-1 around , uh , Hattiesburg . E_S
145322:20	Because , I think 0 what we 're going *-1 to go to *T*-2 is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market . E_S
145329:10	Primary skills which *T*-1 turn out *-2 to be the most important skills in life . E_S
145334:20	And it *EXP*-2 's amazing how much good things like , uh , Sesame Street will do *T*-1 . E_S
145442:17	and I 'm thinking what *ICH*-3 did I get *T*-1 , that *T*-2 costs so much . E_S
145482:10	How , how old are you *T*-1 ? E_S
145506:26	\[ I , \+ I \] know what you mean *T*-1 about the interest rates .
145556:65	on one of the local talk shows here , they had somebody on \[ and , \+ and \] said , what you can do *T*-1 is , uh , * call , you know , E_S
145557:115	if you 've got a pretty good \[ rating , \+ uh , credit rating \] you can call \[ \[ your in- , \+ you know , \[ your , \+ your \] card , \] \+ wherever you got your card from *T*-1 \] and tell them , hey , * either drop my rates or drop my , you know , uh annual fees

145616:4	what should I say *T*-1 E_S

145623:5	How far away do they come from *T*-1 ? E_S
145643:13	and the people who *T*-1 are down there , like , they 'll assign one person in the Utah area , one person in the Washington area E_S

145745:22	My grandmother 's , uh , sister who *T*-1 would be somewhere \[ in , \+ in \] West Virginia . E_S
145762:4	How you doing *T*-1 ? E_S
145781:4	Where are you calling from *T*-1 E_S

145814:72	I can tell you about my last job or whatever you want *-1 to talk about *T*-2 that or my husband 's or what I think *T*-3 . E_S
145847:18	* go to work when I wanted *-1 to *?* *T*-2 or not E_S

145931:31	Even at a group rate , I could n't believe how much is our , N_S
145966:32	and I would see the G M people come in when \[ they were , \+ they would \] shut down *-1 to retool *T*-2 . E_S
146021:31	But I think 0 there 's a case , where benefits have gotten , N_S
146105:27	But I have all these friends that wherever you go *T*-1 , \[ they , \+ *T*-2 they \] sit down and the next thing 0 you know *T*-3 , *T*-2 they pull out of their , uh , bags \[ some , \+ \] their most recent , uh , needle craft E_S

146193:15	I think 0 when babies , N_S
146219:7	but when I washed them *T*-1 , although I took the precaution of *-2 turning them inside out I really did n't do anything else . And truly , everything *ICH*-3 fell off , or most of it . E_S

146524:59	\[ I , \+ I \] believe , if I , am in a position , uh , like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care *T*-1 *T*-2 that I will be able *-4 to just bring her *ICH*-3 into my home and my father also , \[ and \+ uh , or \] have someone go into their home , you know \[ and \+ uh , and \] look \[ after \+ \] them .

147723:14	You 're asking what my opinion about , whether it *EXP*-1 's possible * to have honesty in government *T*-2 . E_S
147728:54	Uh , I think 0 it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody *T*-1 . E_S
147733:48	But , uh , other than that I think 0 maybe it just depends on how you define honesty *T*-1 . E_S
147739:63	It said that it *EXP*-2 's impossible * to have a completely honest system of government because people who *T*-1 choose government for their positions are power seekers . E_S

149369:33	I think 0 it 's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction *T*-1 E_S
149383:40	I think 0 a lot of people are panicked *-1 , how kids are turning out *T*-4 and how things are going for kids *T*-5 and realizing 0 they 've got *-2 to start *-3 doing something . E_S
149383:62	I think 0 a lot of people are panicked *-1 , how kids are turning out *T*-4 and how things are going for kids *T*-5 and realizing 0 they 've got *-2 to start *-3 doing something . E_S
149405:5	When we tell people how many kids we have *T*-1 *T*-2 they look at us like we did n't have good sense . E_S
149405:20	When we tell people how many kids we have *T*-1 *T*-2 they look at us like we did n't have good sense . E_S
149467:6	And what kind do you have *T*-1 ? E_S
149484:14	Oh . Uh , how 's the disposition of your Siamese cat *T*-1 ? E_S
149587:67	Well , do you live , \[ \[ you , \+ you \] \+ \] in a house , or a place where you , uh , N_S
149592:22	but we 're in a subdivision where we really ca n't allow the dog *T*-1 , E_S
149623:7	especially when they 're young when they bring them in *T*-1 *T*-2 N_S
149623:21	especially when they 're young when they bring them in *T*-1 *T*-2 N_S
149727:84	and especially in this election year , I think that , uh , there ought *-1 to be \[ so- , \+ at least some \] conversation about what we are supposed *-2 to do *T*-3 about this . E_S
149733:90	it kind of seems to me that everyone 's offering , you know , their token little tax cut program , you know , \[ when it 's \+ when it 's \] just such a bad time for it *T*-1 . E_S
149740:11	Uh especially what , for instance , George Bush is offering *T*-1 . E_S
149770:46	Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] have n't really heard much of what the \[ other people , \+ other candidates \] have said *T*-1 that *T*-2 have made a lot of sense to me either , E_S
149789:32	I mean that 's better than George Bush who *T*-1 came out and said , No , E_S
149808:32	Well , I 'd really like *-1 to know where that money is actually going *-2 to go *T*-3 , E_S
149860:4	where do you go *T*-1 ? E_S
149875:89	And one of the things 0 we discussed *T*-1 was , you know , \[ \[ where our , \+ where the budget situate- , \] \+ how the budget situation \] just got so out of hand *T*-2 . E_S
149879:10	And essentially what *T*-1 happened was , N_S
149885:267	and \[ \[ Con- , \+ Congress , \] realizing that they were going *-1 to lose a , \+ the Democratic Congress realized that they were going *-2 to lose a \] propaganda war , you know , \[ bye-bye , \+ you know , bye-bye \] *-4 removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and \[ created , you know , \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that , \] \+ you know , created the \] huge deficit *ICH*-5 that year which *T*-6 moved us into the trillion dollar deficit . E_S
149894:39	\[ You , \+ you \] just have *-1 to wonder what they 're thinking *T*-2 in Washington . E_S
149911:10	um , what *T*-1 really bothers me is 0 it just seems like \[ if , \+ if \] anyone were *-2 to say , you know , well I 'm going *-3 to raise taxes and cut the budget and \[ we 're \+ MUMBLEx , we 're \] going *-4 to have *-5 to do some unpopular things , I mean , he would n't have a chance of * getting elected *-6 . E_S
149916:57	I mean , it 's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing , you know where people just \[ want , \+ want \] *-1 to have , you know , whatever *T*-2 will make them feel good , right now *T*-3 , you know . E_S
149916:108	I mean , it 's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing , you know where people just \[ want , \+ want \] *-1 to have , you know , whatever *T*-2 will make them feel good , right now *T*-3 , you know . E_S
149921:14	and that 's what *T*-1 really is getting me about what George Bush 's stand on the budget is *T*-2 right now is that he is saying , I am going *-3 to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you 'll be happy come November , and you 'll elect me again E_S
149921:37	and that 's what *T*-1 really is getting me about what George Bush 's stand on the budget is *T*-2 right now is that he is saying , I am going *-3 to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you 'll be happy come November , and you 'll elect me again E_S
149947:9	MUMBLEx , how do you feel about crime in the city *T*-1 ? E_S
149970:37	I think 0 it seems that there 's certain areas where , uh , the crime is focused *-1 *T*-2 uh . E_S
149975:7	Well what do you think 0 *T*-1 can be done *-2 about the crime in the city ? E_S
149977:39	Well , I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ \] what *T*-1 's been happening over the last several years it seems 0 they 've been beefing up the police patrols , trying *-2 to \[ put , \+ put \] more guys , more cops , higher visibility , E_S
149990:87	You know , particularly in some of the housing projects , uh , you know , \[ that 's , \+ that \] tends *-1 to be where a lot of that crime is focused *-2 *T*-3 E_S
150031:92	I came to the conclusion *ICH*-1 also that , you know , \[ just , \+ \] if you are walking in a downtown area , you know , where there 's a lot of crime *T*-2 , a lot of that 's going to * \[ just , \+ just \] keeping your senses about you \[ and , \+ and \] trying not * to look like a victim , you know . E_S
150041:95	and , you know , * \[ * do n't , \+ do n't \] be looking around like you 've never been there before and you have no idea where you are *T*-1 . E_S
150060:15	there are times when you ca n't avoid all that *T*-1 E_S
150074:46	but that was in a more of \[ a , \+ a \] setting where there was a number of people around *T*-1 , E_S
150080:91	and kind of a couple of people , they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off , so I did n't know who *T*-1 had it . E_S
150115:37	Oh , \[ where was , \+ \[ where , \+ where \] was \] that *T*-1 ? E_S
150142:24	and \[ when he , \+ when he \] got it back *T*-1 his , um , dashboard was sitting in the front seat . E_S
150179:6	So how do you know this much about , um , * stealing cars *T*-1 ? E_S
150184:9	So . How 's your products been *T*-1 ? E_S
150195:36	unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time , when I bought my new house *T*-1 , E_S
150230:21	and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it 's nontoxic and such *T*-1 , E_S
150231:7	and when you get the product *T*-1 it ends up *-2 being toxic and all these warnings . E_S
150278:34	So . It was a call to the local appliance dealer who *T*-1 came out and fixed them all , E_S
150331:32	after we assemble each part of the inflator or what *T*-1 explodes the bag , we check *-2 to make * sure 0 it 's there after we install it , E_S
150348:19	it *ICH*-3 's incredible how much testing they have *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
150361:9	and so what do you think , next to salary do you rank *T*-1 , is the most important job benefits ? E_S
150377:45	\[ and , \+ uh , so \] it 's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing *T*-1 , E_S
150378:4	where the school district does , um , 0 the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of , uh , costs *T*-1 . E_S
150387:31	or now we 're on a managed care thing , which *T*-1 has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any . E_S
150417:18	and I paid ten dollars when I went *-1 to see him *T*-2 that first day , E_S
150433:4	when I first started *-1 working *T*-2 which , N_S
150434:16	three years ago is when I first got into full time employment *T*-1 E_S
150447:113	but if you , you know , have a family \[ and , \+ and , \] um , everybody 's gone to different doctors , uh , it *EXP*-2 is hard * to give up somebody who you feel 0 *T*-1 knows you and your body and \[ your , \+ \] just has , you know , all the medical history E_S
150493:28	they want everybody educated *-1 , no matter what it costs *T*-2 , E_S
150497:18	and I do n't know who *T*-1 looks forward to it more , the students or the teachers and the staff . E_S
150504:4	What do you do *T*-1 there ? E_S
150508:13	and that 's who I work with *T*-1 . E_S
150512:53	Um , and we 're given *-2 , you know , a good bit of flexibility in what we do *T*-1 . E_S
150555:4	How 's the weather out there in Georgia *T*-1 ? E_S
150650:6	So how is that *T*-1 ? E_S
150657:10	And from when I 've done it *T*-1 , it does give you \[ a good , \+ a real good \] workout . E_S
150685:61	I wear high tops and then also \[ \[ an \+ an- , \] \+ a \] support ankle brace which *T*-1 is very stiff E_S
150702:13	So that 's what he does *T*-1 , E_S
150716:46	and I could play again on it because after a while you just learn how * to rehabilitate yourself to play that way *T*-1 . E_S
150727:37	\[ But , \+ um , so \] \[ how , \+ how \] successful is your exercise video *T*-1 ? E_S
150729:18	It *EXP*-1 is amazing how fast you take off the inches *T*-2 E_S
150738:24	But , it *EXP*-1 is really amazing how fast the inches come off *T*-2 , E_S
150774:7	So how do you get most of your current event information *T*-1 ? E_S
150793:17	you keep up on what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
150806:91	and so um , I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then , um , * talking with people and just hearing what *T*-1 's going on . MUMBLEx . E_S
150831:34	Oh , \[ ch- , \+ see channel , \] where I am *T*-1 channel eight 's , um , like public T V , N_S
150839:60	but , um , it seems that , um , they kind of get *-1 to throw their opinions into how they , you know , report on the news *T*-2 . E_S
150842:37	And I think 0 even in the elections , they choose who they 're going *-2 to follow *T*-1 and who they 're not *?* *T*-3 , E_S
150842:66	And I think 0 even in the elections , they choose who they 're going *-2 to follow *T*-1 and who they 're not *?* *T*-3 , E_S
150852:35	I think 0 you get a very lopsided picture of what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
150856:42	they give each candidate perhaps , you know , ten second blurbs in which * \[ to , \+ you know , to \] say *T*-1 ,
150868:32	but other than that , you really do n't know what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
150874:16	and I do study who *T*-1 's running in our area , E_S
150875:16	and I do study what *T*-1 's going on in the economy . E_S
150881:89	and \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] real good because it gives like a brief summary of *RNR*-4 , or like the updates , like of *RNR*-4 what *T*-1 's going on in science without *-5 getting into a lot of detail that *T*-2 would , you know , bog me down that I would n't know about *T*-3 E_S
150894:30	of course , \[ during the w- , \+ when we were in war *T*-1 , \] I read up on that just a little in the newspaper *-2 to find out what *T*-3 was going on . E_S
150894:98	of course , \[ during the w- , \+ when we were in war *T*-1 , \] I read up on that just a little in the newspaper *-2 to find out what *T*-3 was going on . E_S
150903:65	If they put it out in a video , or on , not a video but a cassette tape or something , where you could just listen to it *T*-1 I would do that while I was doing other things . E_S
150917:69	Well , \[ I , \+ um , they \] even did a story *ICH*-3 on our news here in Texas on what people wanted *-1 to see more of *T*-2 , E_S
150923:25	that we want *-2 to hear what *T*-3 's going on with the economy , what *T*-4 's being done *-1 * to help it , what *T*-5 's going on in other countries , what *T*-6 's , you know , just more information . E_S
150923:52	that we want *-2 to hear what *T*-3 's going on with the economy , what *T*-4 's being done *-1 * to help it , what *T*-5 's going on in other countries , what *T*-6 's , you know , just more information . E_S
150923:87	that we want *-2 to hear what *T*-3 's going on with the economy , what *T*-4 's being done *-1 * to help it , what *T*-5 's going on in other countries , what *T*-6 's , you know , just more information . E_S
150923:114	that we want *-2 to hear what *T*-3 's going on with the economy , what *T*-4 's being done *-1 * to help it , what *T*-5 's going on in other countries , what *T*-6 's , you know , just more information . E_S
150931:54	Well , I guess 0 we 'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the , uh , summer olympics *T*-1 . E_S
150979:125	I think that , uh , one , uh , advantage of * having , uh , the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want *-1 to make * sure that you do n't , uh , convict someone who , uh , *T*-3 really should n't be convicted *-2 . E_S
150984:52	I guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *T*-1 is very unreasonable in some way , that , uh , you , uh , would have a problem , uh , you know , that you would n't convict someone who *T*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4 . E_S
150984:147	I guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *T*-1 is very unreasonable in some way , that , uh , you , uh , would have a problem , uh , you know , that you would n't convict someone who *T*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4 . E_S
150996:10	Uh , what sorts of cases were they *T*-1 ? E_S
150998:34	They were just , you know , small time cases where , uh , trailers and banks were involved *T*-1 , you know . E_S
151008:21	\[ What , uh , \+ what \] was the verdict *T*-1 ? E_S
151036:20	\[ What was , \+ what was \] the other case *T*-1 ? E_S
151058:17	but I declined it which I 'm able *-1 to do *T*-2 because I 'm a student , because it was , uh , a very bad time . E_S
151069:69	I would n't think that it does I mean , \[ \[ from , \+ from \] my , \+ from what \] I experienced *T*-1 in them , E_S
151089:24	someone had *-1 to figure out what *T*-2 was going on ? E_S
151091:14	That 's about what it was *T*-1 . E_S
151114:118	and I wonder \[ \[ if , \+ uh , if there 's really , \] \+ um , if the system \] works adequately \[ in , \+ in \] *-1 educating the jurors about , uh , whatever , um , you know , issue *T*-2 is under discussion . E_S
151116:105	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think that \[ \[ they , \+ they , \] \+ they \] educate them enough * \[ to , \+ to \] really know what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
151122:107	\[ the , \+ the \] bank was suing them \[ for , \+ uh , \] because they went *-1 to get \[ the , \+ the \] trailer \[ that , \+ which \] *T*-2 was , uh , seemingly their property . E_S
151141:10	And then when they came *-1 to get it *T*-2 , well , it was on the landlord 's property E_S
151155:10	and then when they came back *-1 to get it a couple of days later *T*-2 it had rained and got all in it . E_S
151173:66	I was in the Air Force , and served on a court martial , uh , board *ICH*-2 a couple of times , which *T*-1 is very similar to a jury . E_S
151180:21	and I could n't figure out why I had n't been called *-1 yet *T*-2 E_S
151208:24	and then , it was always exciting when we got called *-1 *-4 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] go *T*-2 , because then we thought 0 we might be able *-3 to do something else besides , uh , * just sit in the jury room . E_S
151255:49	although in my case I might have been more , uh , sympathetic with the person who *T*-1 got caught *-2 , E_S
151261:64	So , uh , \[ were , \+ were \] the , uh , sentences that the judge handed *T*-1 out what you thought *T*-2 to be fair , E_S
151268:27	and there was one guy on the jury who *T*-1 announced to everybody that he did n't need *-2 to deliberate , because he 'd already decided that the guy was , uh , not guilty , E_S and he would never vote for guilty . E_S
151302:10	Oh , how many members were *T*-1 on the jury ? E_S
151342:68	and , you know , * being fair to the person , if the government does n't prove its case , no matter how you feel *T*-1 , you have *-2 to go by what *T*-3 's offered *-4 as proof , E_S
151342:103	and , you know , * being fair to the person , if the government does n't prove its case , no matter how you feel *T*-1 , you have *-2 to go by what *T*-3 's offered *-4 as proof , E_S
151400:5	What type of field of work are you in *T*-1 ? E_S
151419:33	see , I work in the automotive air bag industry , where we make the safety bags for the cars *T*-1 , E_S
151438:44	I think that , uh , you know , under certain circumstances , especially when you 're working \[ in , \+ in \] high risk , uh , uh , industries , where you can really hurt other people *T*-1 *T*-2 , \[ that , \+ that \] you need *-3 to have that kind of stuff . E_S
151438:98	I think that , uh , you know , under certain circumstances , especially when you 're working \[ in , \+ in \] high risk , uh , uh , industries , where you can really hurt other people *T*-1 *T*-2 , \[ that , \+ that \] you need *-3 to have that kind of stuff . E_S
151451:11	this is where I start *-1 having my problems with my company *T*-2 . E_S
151469:19	I 'm not really sure what the , N_S
151490:36	But , uh , \[ when you 're not , \+ when you 're \] a private company *T*-1 , the rules do n't always apply . E_S
151516:38	I know one employee , E_S 0 I know , 0 when I was working with *T*-1 *T*-2 , *T*-1 he had alcohol on his breath , E_S
151535:17	That just shows you how much I 've been paying attention *T*-1 , E_S
151559:95	and \[ I , \+ personally , I \] do n't think 0 I would work for somebody if they were going *-2 to reject me on the basis of what *T*-1 's inside my body . E_S
151570:19	There 's too many cases where it can , you know , N_S
151578:42	I would n't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I 'm flying in an airplane *T*-1 . E_S
151588:29	But , have you ever been in a situation where \[ you , \+ you \] were drug tested *-1 *T*-2 E_S
151607:47	I mean \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want *-1 to look at your urine before I 'm going *-2 to talk to you *T*-3 . E_S
151611:52	and I just thought 0 it *ICH*-4 was dumb of the company , at a point where they were trying *-1 to convince me \[ to , \+ to \] want *-2 to work for them *T*-3 * to do this , E_S
151627:24	and then you had a physical , where you were drug tested *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
151630:18	and I know people who *T*-1 have been drug tested *-2 and who *T*-3 have not , you know , been hired *-4 by a corporation which , uh , you know , N_S
151630:42	and I know people who *T*-1 have been drug tested *-2 and who *T*-3 have not , you know , been hired *-4 by a corporation which , uh , you know , N_S
151637:65	just to the fact that I do n't know that it *EXP*-1 is a company 's business * to regulate what its employees are doing *T*-2 when they 're not at work *T*-3 . E_S
151637:84	just to the fact that I do n't know that it *EXP*-1 is a company 's business * to regulate what its employees are doing *T*-2 when they 're not at work *T*-3 . E_S
151638:38	I mean , during the eight hours , during the day , when they 're supposed *-1 to be there *T*-2 , I think 0 they have every right *-3 to say \[ this is , \+ these behaviors \] are acceptable *T*-4
151640:7	but when it enters into what they 're doing *T*-1 when they 're not at work *T*-2 *T*-3 , I find that to be fairly offensive also . E_S
151640:21	but when it enters into what they 're doing *T*-1 when they 're not at work *T*-2 *T*-3 , I find that to be fairly offensive also . E_S
151640:38	but when it enters into what they 're doing *T*-1 when they 're not at work *T*-2 *T*-3 , I find that to be fairly offensive also . E_S
151643:56	well like you say , I mean , if it 's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt *-4 *T*-1 , then really \[ what people ought *-5 to be doing *T*-2 , \+ I mean , \[ the , \+ the \] employer ought *-6 to be judging \] you on how well you do your work *T*-3 rather than on these other factors . E_S
151643:179	well like you say , I mean , if it 's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt *-4 *T*-1 , then really \[ what people ought *-5 to be doing *T*-2 , \+ I mean , \[ the , \+ the \] employer ought *-6 to be judging \] you on how well you do your work *T*-3 rather than on these other factors . E_S
151664:44	Well , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] can see how they can say in the work place 0 \[ we , \+ you \] do n't want them to smoke *T*-1 , E_S
151665:7	but when somebody leaves work *T*-1 , I do n't think that it *EXP*-2 's the employer 's right * to regulate their life style at all . E_S
151670:110	Uh , I really think 0 it should be *?* , except as I 've mentioned twice now , in the specified industries \[ or , \+ or \] jobs , because there are certain things where it *EXP*-1 's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times *T*-3 . E_S
151724:6	And how did you feel 0 it went *T*-1 ? E_S
151728:33	so \[ I , \+ I \] kind of know how * to do these things *T*-1 . E_S
151737:8	Usually when we have kind of our family reunion *T*-1 it 's my grandmother 's birthday , E_S
151761:9	Well , what did you find 0 *T*-1 was most helpful in * planning the birthday get together ? E_S
151763:51	Um , \[ the , \+ probably the \] biggest challenge was * getting a place where everyone , you know , could eat comfortably \[ and , \+ and \] everything *T*-1 , uh . E_S
151806:7	Now how old is she *T*-1 ? E_S
151830:11	That 's what I call her *T*-1 . E_S
151957:10	well , how many , uh , uh , families *T*-1 own a refrigerator , E_S
151960:8	and how many people , especially here in Texas , *T*-2 own cars and trucks with air conditioning . E_S
151969:56	and , uh , the only reason 0 I did n't , uh , get into that more , when I \[ was , \+ had \] my little business *T*-1 *T*-2 , was because , uh , most of your , uh , air conditioning \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ on \] vehicles tend *-3 to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree E_S
151976:20	so , uh , that 's why I \[ stayed in , \+ stayed more \[ towar- , \+ towards , \] \] uh , uh , N_S
151992:52	Well , \[ \[ most , \+ most , \] \+ most \] of the time when you see \[ bus , \+ uh , you know , the busses \] with the diesel *T*-1 \[ that 's , \+ uh , those \] are carbon particles , and carbon dioxide and water vapor , uh , E_S
151996:25	because \[ when you , \+ when diesel \] is burned *-1 *T*-2 it 's it , N_S
152012:11	That 's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios *T*-2 \[ as the , \+ as the \] air is heated *-1 , you know , by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio E_S
152048:4	Where do you find places 0 * to camp *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
152050:48	Well , uh , \[ we , \+ we \] do a lot of canoeing when we go *-1 camping *T*-2 E_S
152072:54	and so we have found that camping with the little ones is n't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves *T*-1 . E_S
152094:22	\[ What , \+ uh , what \] kind of camping do they like *T*-1 best ? E_S
152095:16	Do they like it where they have tents *T*-1 E_S
152121:11	Oh , and what does that consist of *T*-1 ? E_S
152123:83	Uh , it 's just a piece of material \[ that *T*-1 has , \+ uh , that *T*-2 has \] a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent uh , like a , uh *T*-3 , N_S
152131:16	and we use them when we go *-1 backpacking *T*-2 . E_S
152188:13	Do you know what armadillo is *T*-1 ? E_S
152249:44	and for me this is the first job 0 I 've had *T*-1 where they 've covered that much *T*-2 , E_S
152254:9	Um , what 's your situation *T*-1 ? E_S
152283:55	and , uh , \[ we get twenty-four days a year , \+ right from the day one when you start work *T*-1 , you get twenty-four days a year , \] uh , time off . E_S
152309:4	What do you consider *T*-1 most important , you think , in terms \[ of , \+ of \] the different benefits ? E_S
152321:47	and \[ I do n't know that , \+ uh , I do n't know what \] the solution *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 to it . E_S
152366:16	\[ how , \+ how \] does , uh , University of New Hampshire handle it *T*-1 ? E_S
152387:36	The benefits plan is different \[ for operating , \+ for what we call *T*-1 operating \] staff , which *T*-2 are considered *-3 to be , uh , clerical personnel , accountants , things like that as opposed to what they call *T*-4 the P A T staff , which I belong to *T*-5 E_S
152387:62	The benefits plan is different \[ for operating , \+ for what we call *T*-1 operating \] staff , which *T*-2 are considered *-3 to be , uh , clerical personnel , accountants , things like that as opposed to what they call *T*-4 the P A T staff , which I belong to *T*-5 E_S
152387:126	The benefits plan is different \[ for operating , \+ for what we call *T*-1 operating \] staff , which *T*-2 are considered *-3 to be , uh , clerical personnel , accountants , things like that as opposed to what they call *T*-4 the P A T staff , which I belong to *T*-5 E_S
152387:155	The benefits plan is different \[ for operating , \+ for what we call *T*-1 operating \] staff , which *T*-2 are considered *-3 to be , uh , clerical personnel , accountants , things like that as opposed to what they call *T*-4 the P A T staff , which I belong to *T*-5 E_S
152403:71	Uh , for the operating staff it 's \[ on a seniority , \+ it 's , you know , based *-1 on how long they 've worked there *T*-2 . \] E_S
152407:12	That determines how much , uh , vacation time they get *T*-1 . E_S
152410:85	I 'm kind of interested because \[ I 'm \+ actually , that 's the route 0 I 'd \] like *-1 to take *T*-2 when I finally get my degree *T*-3 \[ is * to , \+ uh , is * to \] teach in a university . E_S
152424:63	That 's one of the things 0 I 'd like *-1 to think about *T*-2 is in what kind of benefits \[ they would , \+ uh , they would \] cover *T*-3 and things like that . E_S
152459:10	and that what I hired for *T*-1 and then \[ I , \+ \] just very little variation from that . E_S
152467:27	Uh , so that 's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution *T*-1 , E_S
152498:183	Uh , so \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ there \+ it 's \] probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in , uh , institutions are slower * to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses , we need *-1 to cut back , that 's what we do *T*-2 . E_S
152511:85	and institutionally , like here at the university , oh if there is a cut back , well gee , it 's not \[ where it necessarily \+ where it 's needed *-1 *T*-2 , \] E_S
152512:11	it 's where it 's most expedient *T*-1 which ,
152513:32	Well , in one sense for us , it 's where it makes the least noise *T*-1 which *T*-2 means 0 it 's often the lowest support type roles . E_S
152513:54	Well , in one sense for us , it 's where it makes the least noise *T*-1 which *T*-2 means 0 it 's often the lowest support type roles . E_S
152519:37	\[ where the most dollar , \+ \[ where , \+ where \] \] you know it cuts back the most *T*-1 . E_S
152537:54	and it *EXP*-1 's very easy for them to say , oh this is the best way when they really are n't aware of what all it took *T*-2 * to get the work done *-3 *T*-4 you know . E_S
152537:77	and it *EXP*-1 's very easy for them to say , oh this is the best way when they really are n't aware of what all it took *T*-2 * to get the work done *-3 *T*-4 you know . E_S
152541:16	And then they wonder why it does n't get done *-1 in the same amount of time *T*-2 . E_S
152555:8	so what else do you think 0 *T*-1 is important ? E_S
152605:9	Well , how do you feel *T*-1 about trial by jury ? E_S
152652:31	and , uh , \[ when you , \+ when you are \] selecting a jury and you are doing it partially \[ if , \+ if \] not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have *T*-1 *T*-2 you know that is a matter of concern to me too . E_S
152652:109	and , uh , \[ when you , \+ when you are \] selecting a jury and you are doing it partially \[ if , \+ if \] not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have *T*-1 *T*-2 you know that is a matter of concern to me too . E_S
152672:23	And I guess 0 that 's what I am concerned with *T*-1 . E_S
152678:10	well , what I do n't like *T*-1 about , uh , \[ sentence , \+ the jury doing the sentencing \] in that I think 0 it becomes a lot less , N_S
152696:68	and you do see such uneven sentencing you know , evidence of it in the newspapers and such , I mean where , uh , it would appear 0 the crimes were very similar *T*-1 E_S
152721:11	You know where he says * kill all the lawyers *T*-1 . E_S
152744:29	it 's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument *T*-1 . E_S
152754:52	I have been involved , uh , just \[ sli- , \+ slightly \] in a case where I know 0 the person is guilty *T*-1 E_S
152770:9	Uh , what 's your feeling about that *T*-1 ? E_S
152776:10	uh , where you live *T*-1 do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both ? E_S
152782:51	In New Hampshire we have , uh , uh , \[ no , \+ no , \] what we call *T*-1 broad base taxes . E_S
152789:13	and we have what we call *T*-1 the five B s *ICH*-2 . Uh , \[ th- , \+ \] for our taxes . Booze , uh , butts , cigarettes , beds , uh , hotel room tax bellies , a meal tax and bets , gambling . E_S
152803:45	and I , MUMBLEx think 0 it 's about the time of the year when you just start *-1 getting , N_S
152826:26	Do you think that , uh , for whatever taxes we do pay *T*-1 that , uh , we are getting value for it ? E_S
152836:11	You know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
152848:33	and that is that money tends *-1 to stick where it lands first *T*-2 E_S
152849:7	and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol *T*-1 , uh , a lot of it stays there
152867:16	and I do n't what *T*-1 happens with all the money because if their plans do n't work , N_S you know ,
152893:9	those who *T*-1 made under a certain amount would n't owe any taxes , E_S
152895:86	and you would just pay a flat tax . No exemptions , no deductions or anything else \[ after \+ you know , after \] you figure up who *T*-1 's in your family . E_S
152941:29	\[ What is , \+ do you know what \] your state income tax rate is *T*-1 ? E_S
152955:42	\[ You 're like , \+ you 're like \] my daughter who *T*-1 is in college down in Massachusetts E_S
152968:4	How do you keep up with current events *T*-1 ? E_S
152974:9	what what channel *ICH*-1 do you watch *T*-2 or what station ? E_S
152974:32	what what channel *ICH*-1 do you watch *T*-2 or what station ? E_S
152986:34	so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which *T*-1 \[ is \+ really is n't \] too great sometimes . E_S
152992:133	I usually tend *-1 to just , you know , rely on , you know , T V , uh , again , you know , just through the grapevine \[ just , \+ just \] to know like , you know like what today 's stories are *T*-2 E_S
153007:10	Well , what I really do n't like *T*-1 about T V , especially local news as compared to like national news is just , uh , 0 \[ it seems , \+ it seems \] like everything is very spoon feed E_S
153023:167	\[ Also , \+ also \] I have the observation *ICH*-6 \[ of , \+ uh , with \] the press \[ is \+ \] that , like \[ any \+ any \] stories that I had any first hand knowledge of *T*-1 that I see *T*-2 in the press , you know , which *T*-3 only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for \[ anything of \+ you know \[ or \+ \] anything that \] *T*-4 actually \[ had , \+ had \] more than just a blurb about it . \[ That \+ \] the press has managed *-5 to just mess up some aspect of the story E_S
153043:48	\[ and so \+ \] that \[ then \+ \] like local news is really who *T*-1 grew the biggest tomato E_S
153057:6	or who *T*-1 killed who . E_S
153065:68	Well , \[ in , \+ uh , in \] Dallas , I do n't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby 's *T*-1 E_S
153075:20	and they were taping people who *T*-1 were crying who *T*-2 had everything E_S
153075:34	and they were taping people who *T*-1 were crying who *T*-2 had everything E_S
153130:4	What did you think *T*-1 of the coverage of the war ? E_S
153143:33	They kept *-1 just showing , you know , how great we were doing *T*-2 E_S
153151:64	a lot of times like the news coverage showed all \[ the , \+ you know , the \] guys who *T*-1 did n't get hurt *-2 coming home and all the big parties E_S
153156:30	if they were going *-1 to show that why did n't they show the guys who you know *T*-2 got really hurt *-3 and everything *T*-4 . E_S
153156:51	if they were going *-1 to show that why did n't they show the guys who you know *T*-2 got really hurt *-3 and everything *T*-4 . E_S
153165:5	What kind of pets do you have *T*-1 ? E_S
153193:4	How does he treat the other people *T*-1 ? E_S
153200:13	You know when he is in the house *T*-1 , he will come up
153202:67	but if anybody reaches over *-1 to pet him or whatever , he 'll just kind of look at them like what are doing *T*-2 . E_S
153225:48	Well , \[ we , \+ we \] named it Hooper because that 's where we got it from *T*-1 . E_S
153247:16	so that 's mostly why we got it *T*-1 . *-2 To keep her company while I am away at work . E_S
153273:47	But , I mean , that \[ did , \+ did \] more responsibility . When it 's yours and not your brother 's *T*-1 . E_S
153280:5	when I was growing up *T*-1 \[ I had , \+ we always had \] a dog E_S
153288:11	That 's what we found *T*-1 . E_S
153328:29	and he was just too big for our kids when we got him *T*-1 E_S
153332:19	and \[ we , \+ when we \] moved into our house *T*-1 that was the first thing 0 we wanted *-2 to get *T*-3 \[ was , \+ uh , you know , was \] a pet E_S
153381:4	How do you feel *T*-1 about gun control ? E_S
153391:61	But I do n't really know , I mean , unless they do , uh , just outlaw them , how you can , uh , prevent that *T*-2 . E_S
153404:19	well do you even know what the procedures are *T*-1 now ? E_S
153422:45	So , \[ does , \+ now do \] they want us to say where we feel *T*-1 about it , like in *-2 rating it one to ten . E_S
153427:11	That 's where I would probably be *T*-1 . E_S
153431:62	Well , I mean , I mean I do n't really know \[ what they can , \+ how they can \] really enforce the laws any better *T*-1 E_S
153443:53	if you are looking at like you know country \[ that , \+ uh , where \] they do have a lot more gun control *T*-1 , like England and places like that , you know E_S the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much . E_S
153462:24	Uh , I 'm not really sure how bad it is *T*-1 . E_S
153498:39	I just do n't understand these people , you know , like when \[ they , \+ they \] decide 0 they 're going *-1 to buy a gun 0 *T*-2 to protect themselves *T*-3 . E_S
153499:32	They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which *T*-1 is going *-2 to shoot through you know , N_S
153510:18	Well , Well , now when I first moved to Dallas *T*-1 , I moved up here by myself E_S
153527:76	I do n't want *-1 to be responsible for it because you know if you 're not going *-2 to teach me how * to do it *T*-4 and if I am not going *-3 to , you know , be responsible enough * to go out and learn , I do n't need it . E_S
153559:14	well that 's why I ended up *-1 giving it back to him *T*-2 . E_S
153560:105	I thought well you know . I do n't want it \[ if I do n't know how * to oper- , \+ you know , if I do n't really know how * to use \] it *T*-1 E_S
153578:48	\[ That kind of \+ I mean it \] just makes you wonder how people get guns *T*-1 . E_S
153585:13	So Frank , what , uh , type of , uh , budget do you or your family have *T*-1 ? E_S
153596:41	That 's , uh , sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have *T*-1 . E_S
153621:61	and , uh , I \[ try * to , \+ try *-2 to \] have an idea of what my expenses are *T*-1 E_S
153626:53	and , uh , \[ whenever , uh , I need *-2 to , \+ uh , whenever that changes *T*-3 \] I am pretty well aware of it without * actually having *-1 to maintain a budget for it . E_S
153633:33	and , uh , you know we planned out how much we were going *-1 to spend *T*-2 for food and how much \[ for , \+ for \] this and for that *T*-3 . E_S
153633:71	and , uh , you know we planned out how much we were going *-1 to spend *T*-2 for food and how much \[ for , \+ for \] this and for that *T*-3 . E_S
153634:17	* Kind of anticipate how much things were going *-1 to be *T*-3 . E_S
153645:9	but , what I do *T*-2 on my money market account , my taxes for instance which *T*-1 amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month . I will just take two hundred and twenty out E_S
153645:49	but , what I do *T*-2 on my money market account , my taxes for instance which *T*-1 amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month . I will just take two hundred and twenty out E_S
153652:8	Then when the tax bill comes in *T*-1 I 've got that much set *-2 aside . E_S
153679:24	So , we are on a schedule where I try every , uh , three or four years *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] buy a new one *T*-2 . E_S
153692:144	but \[ you try * to , \+ you try *-1 to \] schedule those things so that , uh , \[ you only , \+ you 're not \] paying for two \[ of \+ \] at the same time I guess 0 *-3 is what I am saying *T*-2 . E_S
153708:43	and I use mine just *-2 to go back and forth to work which *T*-1 is only ten miles away E_S
153752:41	Those things can really upset your budget \[ when they , \+ when they \] come in *T*-1 . E_S
153759:5	What line of work are you in *T*-1 ? E_S
153765:4	What 's your view *T*-1 . E_S
153769:4	What 's your view *T*-1 ? E_S
153811:14	well I know how you feel *T*-1 . E_S
153846:31	and it 's just , 0 you never know who *T*-1 is out there . E_S
153858:4	What do you do *T*-1 , Jeff ? E_S
153872:4	What do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
153894:10	uh , when I was in Colorado *T*-1 we went *-2 deer and elk hunting \[ you , \+ \] you know , quite a bit E_S
153905:15	I guess that what the scale now is *T*-1 , it 's zero \[ for , \+ uh , for \] a complete , N_S
153921:56	I mean , if they can anyway get it , keep criminals from * having guns which they ca n't *?* *T*-1 E_S
153931:108	\[ they , \+ I guess 0 they \] passed a couple of , uh , uh , laws \[ a \+ here while back \] in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go *-1 to buy a hand gun *T*-2 E_S
153937:19	They have a waiting period where you buy one *T*-1 E_S
153958:24	just like I 'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon *T*-1 . E_S
153980:25	You know , it 's like what *ICH*-3 can you do *T*-1 with that , that you ca n't do *T*-2 in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve . E_S
154007:19	Anyway , that 's about where I stand *T*-1 . E_S
154027:4	How is the weather up there *T*-1 ? E_S
154091:21	but it 's DOW JONES , which *T*-1 is , uh , the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire . E_S
154107:34	I do n't know \[ how * to \+ how * to \] describe it *T*-1 E_S
154108:37	so I 'll say a religious newspaper \[ which , \+ which \] *T*-2 talks about issues that *T*-1 are relevant to me in a more broad sense . E_S
154133:29	Uh , after all , \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 writes . E_S
154134:8	People who *T*-1 are journalist who *T*-2 are trained *-3 to write E_S
154134:23	People who *T*-1 are journalist who *T*-2 are trained *-3 to write E_S
154139:46	and , uh , the other thing that I always notice *T*-1 is that whenever they write about something that I 'm an expert in *T*-2 *T*-3 , I find their descriptions to be wrong E_S
154150:42	If I am an expert in it , they usually make mistakes which *T*-1 makes me \[ believe \+ think \] 0 I 'm not expert in it . E_S
154171:18	I know of cases where , uh , we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but , with \[ the \+ the \] attempt * to give you the impression that what they 're talking about *T*-1 is the same thing 0 they are showing you *T*-2 . Which *T*-4 is sort of like a deliberate bias *T*-5 . \[ Which *T*-7 is \+ which *T*-3 is \] rather disturbing *T*-6 . E_S

154196:28	I would be curious *-1 to know what you thought *T*-2 as to how like say C N N T V news compared to the three networks *T*-3 . E_S Uh , you know whether you thought 0 it was more of a biased or whatever E_S
154196:48	I would be curious *-1 to know what you thought *T*-2 as to how like say C N N T V news compared to the three networks *T*-3 . E_S Uh , you know whether you thought 0 it was more of a biased or whatever E_S
154229:14	and , uh , whatever *T*-2 is left *-1 , uh , after that \[ we , \+ you know , we \] sit down and agree on *ICH*-5 kind of \[ what , \+ what \] sort of range we are \[ going * to \+ generally going *-3 to \] shoot for *T*-4 . E_S
154229:108	and , uh , whatever *T*-2 is left *-1 , uh , after that \[ we , \+ you know , we \] sit down and agree on *ICH*-5 kind of \[ what , \+ what \] sort of range we are \[ going * to \+ generally going *-3 to \] shoot for *T*-4 . E_S
154239:7	So what do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
154241:19	Well , that 's basically what we do *T*-1 . E_S
154312:26	Well , it helps you to focus where your money goes *T*-1 E_S
154317:30	but you 're wondering \[ my , \+ \] when you put down all the money that you do bring *T*-1 in *T*-2 N_S
154318:26	and then you 're saying , my word where did all that money go *T*-1 . E_S
154323:4	Where does it go *T*-1 ? E_S
154339:19	and so we could see where every penny went *T*-1 E_S
154340:34	and it *EXP*-2 was really interesting * to see just what you do spend *T*-1 E_S
154383:35	We are just at a point \[ where , \+ where \] we could start *-1 thinking about it *T*-2 E_S
154424:55	And I listen cause on Friday nights \[ they have the , \+ uh , they have what \] they call *T*-1 Saturday Night Alive E_S
154472:5	What kind of N_S
154476:5	What kind of rock music do you listen to *T*-1 ? E_S
154594:22	I do n't even really know who she is *T*-1 , you know . E_S
154646:18	but you know like whenever one of them dies off *T*-1 they get a replacement . E_S
154671:44	I do n't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured *T*-1 , E_S
154702:11	You know what I am saying *T*-1 E_S
154745:19	So , \[ what \+ what \] is the E P A recommending *T*-1 now ? E_S
154752:85	But , he had a lot of , uh , facts 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] give *T*-2 and , uh , things like how many solid waste plants *T*-1 were being shut *-3 down E_S
154754:41	He was talking about , uh , the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print *T*-1 E_S
154760:27	and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling *T*-3 , they 've collected so much news print that they have *-1 to pay *-2 to have it hauled *-4 away . E_S
154766:58	and after a while I just quit *-2 taking the newspaper because I could n't recycle it anymore which *T*-1 is n't good for business on the other end either , I suppose 0 *T*-3 . E_S
154786:21	I mean , that 's why they recycle *T*-1 . E_S
154799:47	but the basic idea , 0 *T*-4 it was presented *-1 to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get *T*-3 back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting *T*-2 into our landfill *T*-5 E_S
154864:78	Well first of all \[ I , \+ I \] \[ ha- , \+ have \] *-1 to ask you \[ how , \+ how \] old you are *T*-2 ? E_S
154878:5	What type of exercise do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
154880:27	Well , I do , uh , jazzercise which *T*-1 is an aerobic , uh , program that , N_S
154917:22	and then you just go in whenever you can *?* *T*-1 . E_S
154956:9	Well , what do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
154961:13	and that 's what I do *T*-1 every day . E_S
154971:4	When my wife lets me *T*-1 . E_S
154973:12	Well , now who do you play with *T*-1 ? E_S
154984:7	but when I graduated *T*-1 I have n't done much . E_S
155000:35	I mean , people are always saying to me , how do you stay thin *T*-1 E_S
155005:16	but I also watch what I eat *T*-1 . You know , E_S
155033:13	so that 's why I 've kept active in that way *T*-1 . E_S
155072:27	I guess 0 there 's a place where you can ski *T*-1 , E_S
155073:22	well is it *ICH*-2 Tahoe ? Where you ski from *T*-1 , E_S
155083:17	I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line *T*-1 . E_S
155110:57	and it sounded like , you know , that they skied really well , \[ and \+ \] when they are actually talking about a place *T*-1 . E_S
155114:11	I know when I went *T*-1 , 0 you can get sore easily E_S
155153:39	but , uh , instead of *-2 just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about *T*-1 , uh , I am starting *-2 to \[ split stu- , \+ split stuff \] up . E_S
155156:4	What are they doing *T*-1 up there ? E_S
155161:20	Uh , there are areas where we could , uh , N_S
155162:48	actually we have a couple of the , uh , handicapped societies , types of places where the uh ,
155168:17	They refund the deposit which *T*-1 is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container E_S
155200:27	actually , the government has placed the deposit which *T*-1 is the inducement * to \[ re- , \+ recycle \] the bottle so that you get your money back E_S
155205:62	You know \[ there 's a , \+ I heard about a \] similar program in New York City where , uh , a thing called * like Homeless Incorporated or something like that , N_S
155206:7	but what they do *T*-1 is * employ , uh , \[ homeless , \+ I think mostly men , but homeless \] people to uh , go out and collect all the recyclable cans E_S
155220:38	but , uh , we do n't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people *T*-1 . E_S
155222:110	Uh , there 's psychological pressure against * employing people to do that kind of thing although , uh , scouts and hockey teams and ball teams , those kinds , uh , regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes *T*-1 . E_S
155229:17	There are several containers where the group called * Cosmopolitan Industries collects *T*-1 E_S
155242:23	I have some friends of mine who *T*-1 use Quicken E_S
155250:77	Um . I 've found 0 it 's the only reliable way 0 * to keep a check book balanced *-2 *T*-3 actually because what *T*-1 will happen is 0 my wife will write a few checks and then , well , uh , uh , not bother *-4 to total it E_S
155266:9	Well , how to you handle that , the long range or medium range planning on finances *T*-1 ? E_S
155269:46	I guess 0 we 've got \[ a , \+ a \] daughter who *T*-1 is eighteen months and another one on the way E_S
155279:17	I have a daughter who *T*-1 's ten E_S
155281:35	but , uh , we 're to the point *ICH*-1 now where our financial income is enough that we can consider *-2 putting some away for college *T*-3 , E_S
155312:40	So , it 's only recently that we 've had the money where we could start *-1 putting away large sums of it for , uh , long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
155328:17	I do n't know how many people *T*-1 are , uh , getting involved in this E_S
155340:11	that is how I got it *T*-1 as well E_S
155351:71	\[ it *EXP*-2 will be interesting * to see what , \+ It *EXP*-1 would be interesting * to see how \] the data base , N_S
155366:8	Well what other long range goals *ICH*-1 do you have *T*-2 besides college ? E_S
155379:31	and , uh , it 's a real shame from what we had *T*-1 before , uh , because we 're , N_S
155384:4	What do you do *T*-1 with your budget ? E_S
155386:4	What do I do *T*-1 , E_S
155390:81	\[ \[ I 'm , \+ I , \] \+ uh , it 's \] called *-1 living within your means . You know , which *T*-2 means at the moment , * paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping 0 the car does n't collapse . E_S
155400:52	Uh , but \[ I have \+ uh , I have \] a rough feel for how much money I can afford *-1 to spend *T*-2 each month E_S
155409:12	so uh , what do yo- , N_S
155415:27	We 're trying *-1 to think of how * to put away some savings and stuff like that *T*-2 E_S
155428:20	But , we do n't know how long it will be a dream *T*-1 . E_S
155433:37	so we 're stepping real careful and trying *-1 to see what *T*-2 's the best way 0 * to save \[ what , \+ the little bit that \] we do get *T*-3 , you know , on top of expenses every month *T*-4 . E_S
155438:9	So , what do you and your husband do *T*-1 ? E_S
155460:9	Overseas , where would you be going *T*-1 ? E_S
155470:4	How long would you be there *T*-1 ? E_S
155488:31	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] know who they are *T*-1 . E_S
155499:47	I was \[ over , \+ over \] four years *-2 doing language surveying which *T*-1 is the first step . E_S
155514:47	So , uh , \[ \[ what , \+ what , \] \+ uh , what \] languages *ICH*-1 do you speak *T*-2 besides English , of course ? E_S
155523:33	So I know the greetings in about ten , and how * to do market stuff *T*-1 , E_S
155537:40	and \[ I knew what I was , \+ I knew what I was \] communicating *T*-1 , E_S
155538:18	but I did n't know what I was saying *T*-1 . E_S
155540:19	and * said something here when I came home and French to somebody *T*-1 E_S
155541:51	and he paled and said , uh , I 'm not going *-2 to tell you what you said *T*-1 . E_S
155550:16	I do n't know what I said *T*-1 to him E_S
155563:14	Uh , so , what do you think *T*-1 , uh , about * putting the elderly in a nursing home ? E_S
155574:68	you may not even have family \[ that *T*-1 is , uh , uh , in , \+ you know , who *T*-2 are around . \] E_S
155599:27	until they get over that hump of whatever *ICH*-3 it is *T*-1 0 they 're dealing with *T*-2 . E_S
155604:56	Because too often the acute hospitals \[ will , \+ are sending \] them out much faster than what they 're really able *-1 to *?* *T*-2 . E_S
155619:56	You know \[ the fam- , \+ well the families \] do not necessarily , uh , know what * to do *T*-1 with them E_S
155621:4	What do you mean *T*-1 ? E_S
155630:4	What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
155633:28	and it depends on \[ how , \+ how \] sick the person is *T*-1 too .
155634:4	What you 're capable of *T*-2 ,
155648:24	I think 0 that 's also where you 're going *-1 to have a lot of people who *T*-2 are going *-3 to *T*-4 , N_S
155648:61	I think 0 that 's also where you 're going *-1 to have a lot of people who *T*-2 are going *-3 to *T*-4 , N_S
155667:17	It just depends on what kind they are *T*-1 . E_S
155676:77	Unfortunately , some elderly \[ have * to go to \+ or have , \] I guess 0 it 's *RNR*-2 Alzheimer 's or where they wonder \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , confused or have some mental problem *T*-1 . E_S
155685:49	You need one that *T*-1 has a unit that *T*-2 's locked *-3 where they are not able *-4 to get out and roam around *T*-5 E_S
155689:17	and you need people who *T*-1 are trained *-2 for that type of problem . E_S
155694:4	Who *T*-1 know what they 're doing *T*-2 with that . E_S
155694:15	Who *T*-1 know what they 're doing *T*-2 with that . E_S
155722:9	and , what I like *T*-1 about it and I think 0 she likes *T*-1 about it is that she knows everybody there now E_S
155730:51	and also they have a lot of , uh , activities going on for the ones who *T*-1 are more active . E_S
155749:55	and , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] hope that I have something like that when I get older *T*-1 . E_S
155752:167	\[ \[ \[ I , \+ I think , \] \+ I think 0 the , \] \+ uh I think that \] the decision that *T*-1 needs *-3 to be made *-4 though on nursing home has *-5 to be a joint one between the , uh , elderly uh , person who *T*-2 's going in and the family that *T*-6 's going *-7 to be , uh , \[ effec- , \+ effected *-8 \] by it E_S
155780:67	If you do n't want *-2 to , you know , uh , talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it *T*-1 . E_S
155840:19	and \[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 is happening is that they 're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it *T*-2 , okay . E_S
155840:58	and \[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 is happening is that they 're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it *T*-2 , okay . E_S
155842:8	Well what *T*-1 happens is that if people start *-2 \[ becoming \+ having \] chronic illness \[ and , \+ and \] things like that , N_S
155843:5	what *T*-1 happened and where they really have *-2 to spend out a lot of money *T*-3 for one particular , N_S
155843:18	what *T*-1 happened and where they really have *-2 to spend out a lot of money *T*-3 for one particular , N_S
155848:31	\[ well what *T*-1 will , \+ well what *T*-2 happens \] then is that they cancel , because they just ca n't cancel an individual . E_S
155854:8	So what they do *T*-1 is \[ that , \+ that \] they cancel the insurance E_S
155873:40	and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants *T*-1 E_S
155874:31	and he can give me access and tell me what * to do *T*-1 and just turn me *-2 loose E_S
155888:23	\[ What kind of , \+ what kind of \] jobs have you done *T*-1 ? E_S
155896:10	Uh , what I really like *T*-1 is , I like *-2 being , N_S
155900:24	a really important thing to me is when \[ they , \+ uh , they \] pay for continuing education *T*-1 . E_S
155907:11	You have what you might call *T*-1 knowledge power E_S
155911:25	you know , \[ when \+ when \] you work at a company *T*-1 whether you know it or not , is that you 're categorized *-2 . E_S
155912:75	Some people *ICH*-3 can be let *-2 go and replaced *-2 like , uh , say , uh , a typist , uh , somebody who *T*-1 does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist . E_S
155918:16	so . That 's where \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I 'm \] like , N_S
155921:5	When you have the knowledge *T*-1 , \[ you 're \+ you 're \] not going *-2 to , uh , you know , be let *-3 go , E_S
155926:8	So what I , N_S
155940:11	you know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
155967:63	you know , \[ they , \+ they \] get paid *T*-1 a hundred and twenty-five grand a year . Which *T*-2 is more than twice my salary by quite a bit E_S
155971:62	and , you know , I 'm going , like , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't understand how they 're supposed *-1 to be my servants and yet they 're paid *-3 more than I am *?* *T*-4 E_S
155981:112	Uh , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 \[ there really is a , \+ there 's a \] lot 0 they need *-1 to learn *T*-3 , you know , when you get there *T*-2 . E_S
156011:229	Uh , \[ the other , \+ the other \] thing that , uh , *T*-1 bothers me about our system is just that , uh , \[ \[ \[ \[ \[ in , \+ for , \] \+ for , \] \+ in , \] \+ in , \] \+ in \] Congress the amount of power 0 \[ any , \+ any \] particular Congress critter has *T*-2 is based *-4 on their seniority and how long they 've been there *T*-3 E_S
156024:37	Uh , the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which *T*-1 is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency . E_S
156057:16	I do n't see why it makes a big difference the C I A *T*-1 because , you know , officially \[ they do n't do , \+ they do n't have \] any operations within the United States other than administrative . E_S
156071:71	I mean , I heard on the radio back \[ a , \+ a \] few weeks ago , uh , during the incidents where \[ they were , \+ you know , like they are n't \] paying \[ their , \+ their \] restaurant bills E_S and they 're bouncing checks all over the place *T*-1 E_S
156080:9	So , how you like New Jersey *T*-1 ? E_S
156091:5	when you get further east towards New York City *T*-1 it gets very industrial E_S
156135:28	Oh , \[ e- , \+ even \] where you do have the inspections *T*-1 , you know , the inspection is once a year . E_S
156148:16	I guess , from what I hear *T*-1 , though , uh , 0 next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars . E_S
156161:69	Uh , I was reading \[ a , \+ an \] article in TIME *ICH*-1 the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that 's going *T*-2 E_S
156171:76	I mean , the , uh , car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of , uh , the , uh , freon . Which *T*-1 is one of the major \[ \[ flor- , \+ chlorofar- , \] \+ fluorocarbons . \] E_S
156180:40	I guess right now 0 \[ what they 're , \+ what they 're \] primarily worried about *T*-1 is third world countries because I guess 0 United States \[ and , \+ and \] Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of * eliminating C F C production , E_S
156195:56	The U S used , you know , all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies *-1 to get where it is today *T*-2 . E_S
156201:88	\[ Or , \+ or \] they want the right * to make the same mistakes themselves * to bootstrap them up to \[ the way , \+ \] where we got to *T*-1 . E_S
156210:49	Uh , \[ what they do n't realize *T*-1 , \+ those third world countries , what they do n't realize *T*-2 \] is how quickly the ozone is depleting *T*-3 . E_S
156210:74	Uh , \[ what they do n't realize *T*-1 , \+ those third world countries , what they do n't realize *T*-2 \] is how quickly the ozone is depleting *T*-3 . E_S
156223:52	Well , you also have the very close related thing of the , uh , rain forest destruction which *T*-1 is the main source of what *T*-2 's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants . E_S
156223:74	Well , you also have the very close related thing of the , uh , rain forest destruction which *T*-1 is the main source of what *T*-2 's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants . E_S
156247:145	Well , \[ not , \+ not \] as hard as some places out west because you do n't get the , uh , major pollution sources as you do out in Denver *ICH*-2 with the inversion and Los Angeles and \[ a- , \+ \] rest of California which *T*-1 is just terrible it sounds . E_S
156287:12	Jimmy , so how do you get most of your news *T*-1 ? E_S
156295:10	So , when you say the morning news , or evening news or national news *T*-1 is when ? E_S
156325:43	and that 's one of the reasons \[ where I , \+ why I \] try and get as many sources as possible *T*-1 , E_S
156326:76	because if you hear the same story from three different sources , then you get a much clearer picture \[ of , \+ of \] what *T*-1 is going on . You would hope 0 *T*-2 , E_S
156327:39	but still , you know , hard * to say that what you 've heard *T*-1 is what *T*-2 really is . E_S
156327:59	but still , you know , hard * to say that what you 've heard *T*-1 is what *T*-2 really is . E_S
156332:16	\[ What , \+ what , \] uh , newspapers do you read *T*-1 ? E_S
156350:26	\[ but , \+ uh , and \] when you read a lot of this stuff *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ the \] quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so , E_S
156372:5	when I get a chance *ICH*-1 *T*-3 , when I 'm in the car a long enough time *ICH*-1 *T*-2 * \[ to , \+ to \] listen to it ,
156372:29	when I get a chance *ICH*-1 *T*-3 , when I 'm in the car a long enough time *ICH*-1 *T*-2 * \[ to , \+ to \] listen to it ,
156379:40	instead of *-3 being , as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb *T*-2 , they go really in depth on topics which I think 0 *T*-1 is good . E_S
156379:101	instead of *-3 being , as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb *T*-2 , they go really in depth on topics which I think 0 *T*-1 is good . E_S
156399:19	* Had that invasion or whatever it is *T*-1 . E_S
156413:45	but then you also have things \[ where you , \+ uh , where they \] broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them *T*-2 which I thought 0 *T*-1 was \[ r- , \+ really \] good . E_S
156413:89	but then you also have things \[ where you , \+ uh , where they \] broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them *T*-2 which I thought 0 *T*-1 was \[ r- , \+ really \] good . E_S
156424:31	Uh , and I guess 0 that 's good when it 's live *T*-1 , \[ if you , \+ if you 'll \] really want that , E_S
156431:112	Well , \[ but the \+ but the \] \[ \[ ne- , \+ news , \] \+ news \] that you would get *T*-1 from any other source is being generated *-2 from that event , which *T*-3 is something that *T*-4 's good *ICH*-5 also about C Span which \[ I , \+ I \] tune into *T*-6 every once in a while . E_S
156431:156	Well , \[ but the \+ but the \] \[ \[ ne- , \+ news , \] \+ news \] that you would get *T*-1 from any other source is being generated *-2 from that event , which *T*-3 is something that *T*-4 's good *ICH*-5 also about C Span which \[ I , \+ I \] tune into *T*-6 every once in a while . E_S
156442:13	and that 's what \[ you 're supposed , \+ you 're supposed \] *-1 to , N_S
156443:90	if you watch the news , \[ you 're going , \+ your opinion is going \] *-1 to be formed *-2 \[ about , \+ \] on what somebody else thought *T*-3 about it as opposed to * actually watching it yourself and forming your own \[ pinion , \+ opinion , \] which I \[ have n't , \+ would \] be much more in favor of *T*-4 * forming my own opinion as opposed to * following someone else 's .

E_S
156450:55	But , one of the ways that I get information *T*-1 is , uh , every day when I log in on the computer *T*-2 I subscribe to \[ this , \+ this \] thing , E_S
156453:44	\[ and , \+ and \] they basically , uh , type out abstracts which *T*-1 are really literally , N_S
156467:147	\[ All 0 we , \+ all 0 I \] do *T*-1 is , uh , * keep a list of things like debts that *T*-2 are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent *T*-3 that month , E_S
156489:45	mine is really simple , because I got all our bills paid *-2 off when , uh , he was a Marine *T*-1 , E_S
156507:37	just real careful with the money *ICH*-2 , you know . What little we have *T*-1 , E_S
156511:16	so , that 's what I do *T*-1 . E_S
156531:29	and you pay twice as much for it when you get done *T*-1 . You know E_S
156585:35	I just keep it in a notebook and write down what I 've made *T*-1 and , uh , you know , what it 's going *-2 to have *-3 to go for *T*-4 that month E_S
156585:71	I just keep it in a notebook and write down what I 've made *T*-1 and , uh , you know , what it 's going *-2 to have *-3 to go for *T*-4 that month E_S
156603:37	It seems like it 's absurd the number of people who *T*-1 end up *-2 having *-3 to pay somebody *-4 to do it . E_S
156632:174	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't trust myself with *-1 using a calculator or computer , \[ y- , \+ \] too much stuff like that because I want *-2 to make * sure \[ that , \+ that \[ I , \+ I \] \] keep on top of the numbers and understand what *T*-3 's going on . E_S
156637:20	I know too many people who *T*-1 use a calculator E_S
156650:26	and I will , uh , check off what checks *T*-1 have cleared E_S
156663:103	And I always check them off and , you know , check my balance and my book \[ and , \+ \] you know , because I always want *-1 to know exactly what I have *T*-2 , you know . E_S
156673:26	so , \[ what are , \+ what are \] your views on capital punishment *T*-1 ? E_S
156707:71	Well , I think 0 capital punishment is supposed *-1 to be primarily a deterrent to other people . You know , who *T*-2 would see it . E_S
156716:18	but I 'm not sure how successful that is *T*-1 . E_S

156815:63	Anyway , I dealt with two or three kids *ICH*-5 today that *T*-1 are going *-2 to end up where somebody \[ has , \+ \] making a decision what * to do *T*-3 with them *T*-4 . E_S

156862:5	What kind of crimes would you \[ d- , \+ use \] it for *T*-1 ? E_S
156889:13	So , Julie , how do you feel *T*-1 about AIDS research ? E_S
156912:7	but what they do *T*-1 is , uh , if , you know , you apply \[ \[ for , \+ for \] \+ *-2 to \] get \[ a , \+ a \] insurance policy they 'll , uh , check *-3 to see if you 're H I V positive E_S
156921:42	Um , well , \[ that 's , \+ but that 's \] why they should have \[ s- , \+ started \] *-1 doing stuff before *T*-2 . E_S
156922:136	I mean , still , you know , since it 's dormant for such a long time , there 's still probably a lot of people , you know , before the tests ever really came out \[ who *T*-1 are , \+ who *T*-2 are \] draining a lot of money right now . You know , E_S
156969:25	I mean , \[ most of what *T*-1 gets raised *-2 , \+ I mean , it 's not really federal movement ,
156970:12	most of what *T*-1 \[ gets raised *-2 , \+ gets raised *-3 \] \] by , uh , uh , you know , conscious , yeah , communities and things like that , you know . E_S
156985:126	and , uh , I think 0 there needs *-1 to be more of that sort of on a federal level , you know , rather than just in the places \[ where it 's , \+ you know , where it 's \] predominated so far *T*-3 , because \[ it 's , \+ you know it 's \] bound *-2 to spread . E_S
156996:46	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't know what the likelihood of that is *T*-1 , E_S
157028:116	and , uh , I think 0 that would be the most effective support 0 they could get *T*-1 is for other people \[ to understand , \+ you know , try *-2 to understand \] what they 're going through *T*-3 and everything and try *-2 to understand that \[ \[ they 're not , \+ you know , they do n't , \] \+ they do n't \] have *-4 to be just completely cut *-5 off \[ from , \+ from \] the community E_S

157097:103	\[ \[ the , \+ the \] question is , \+ you know , the other \[ qu- , \+ problem \] with capital punishment 0 you run into *T*-1 is , \] what are you going *-2 to do *T*-5 about people who *T*-3 are later *-6 to have been found *-4 innocent , you know ? E_S

157114:61	the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is , uh , based *-2 on the , uh , person who *T*-1 is accused *-3 . E_S
157119:9	well , where are we going *-2 to impose d- , you know , N_S
157154:21	but if you look at who *T*-1 gets accused *-2 and who *T*-3 are the ones who *T*-4 actually get executed *-5 , it 's very racially related and ethnically related , E_S

157271:14	you can buy whatever you want *T*-1 . E_S
157293:5	what kind of track is that *T*-1 ? E_S
157318:9	Uh , what are you thinking about *-2 buying *T*-1 ? E_S
157354:73	I mean , \[ they , \+ they \] kind of even brainwash themselves into *-1 thinking 0 they 're better , which *T*-3 is kind of hard 0 * to take *T*-2 . E_S
157372:46	and , uh , \[ it was , \+ it *EXP*-3 was \] amazing how they were completely opposed *T*-2 . E_S
157394:4	which do I like better *T*-1 , E_S
157411:5	What kind of driving just like commuting you 'd want *-1 to \[ do it , \+ use it \] for *T*-2 ? E_S
157424:14	That 's mainly what I 'm looking for *T*-1 . E_S
157464:11	You spend what you have *T*-1 E_S
157474:27	you 're not going *-1 to payoff what you owe *T*-2 , E_S
157475:114	\[ but , \+ so , \] I guess 0 \[ the , \+ the \] question was more like , uh , do you \[ get what you pay f- , \+ you know , get what you pay for *T*-1 . \] E_S
157486:90	So , I think 0 \[ \[ for , \+ for , \] \+ for \] many years , uh , we 've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who *T*-1 are , uh , to a great extent , public servants uh ,
157487:22	we have not paid them really what they 're worth *T*-2 in what they contribute *T*-3 to society . E_S
157487:42	we have not paid them really what they 're worth *T*-2 in what they contribute *T*-3 to society . E_S
157499:96	and , so , \[ I , \+ I \] kind of do n't pay a proportionate amount of taxes \[ to , \+ \] I guess , uh , compared to what I get *T*-1 , because \[ I , \+ \] you know , all \[ my , \+ my \] education is state sponsored . E_S
157528:7	and what I mean *T*-1 by that , the more income 0 you make *T*-2 , the more tax you pay *T*-3 . E_S
157538:15	Uh , last year when they passed the tax laws for the , uh , nineteen ninety , ninety-one , whatever , nineteen ninety-one *T*-1 uh , I added up all the taxes that we were going *-2 to pay *T*-3 on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else , E_S
157557:129	But , you know , \[ there 's f- , \+ there 's \] a lot of taxes 0 you pay *T*-1 that you 're not even aware of *T*-2 that you 're paying *T*-3 , uh , E_S like when you buy a tire *T*-1 , you pay a federal excise tax . E_S
157577:4	which *T*-1 can- , N_S
157583:22	and \[ the , \+ \] what people need *-1 to understand *T*-2 in my opinion , now this is just my opinion , okay , uh , is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes . E_S
157599:15	Based on that , who do you think 0 you 're talking to *T*-1 , E_S
157616:136	I do n't know if it *EXP*-1 's even true that it 's always unanimous because I thought 0 there were cases \[ where , \+ uh , I do n't know if it 's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors , but where \] it *EXP*-2 was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve *T*-3 . E_S
157620:13	and that 's why I phrased it that way *T*-1 . E_S
157627:18	but I do n't know what \[ the , \+ the \] laws , N_S
157630:28	Well , I 'd be curious as to what the , uh , requirement for \[ a , \+ an \] acquittal is *T*-1 . E_S
157636:48	It was also allow the , uh , idea that if you had one person who *T*-1 was , uh , very disagreeable that
157662:30	Well , the people 0 I know *T*-1 who *T*-2 have served have said that usually what *T*-3 ends up *-4 happening is that , you know , after initially * finding out where people stand *T*-5 , that the whole deliberation usually results , if there is \[ a , \+ you know , something like a \] nine , three \[ or , \+ or \] more severe \[ and , \+ and \] the people in the majority trying *-6 to convince the minority that they 're right E_S

157668:134	Well , \[ the , \+ the \] one thing that I know 0 *T*-1 does seem *-2 to happen from people 0 I 've talked to *T*-3 on this , is that in the situation 0 you just said *T*-4 where it 's nine to three , or some such number *T*-5 , \[ that there 's , an effect 0 *T*-7 starts *-8 being \+ that there 's starts *-6 being \] a lot of peer pressure going on E_S
157683:37	Some of them did say that , you know , when they were the only one left * opposing the verdict *T*-1 , uh , you know , everyone was getting on them \[ so , \+ so \] heavily that eventually they just gave in *-4 knowing that nothing 0 they could do *T*-2 could stop it from * either being the verdict 0 everyone else was trying for *T*-3 or a hung jury because the one vote does n't mean anything except the ability * to not have a verdict . E_S
157732:56	but \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] went through that , too , when I was in school *T*-1 , E_S
157748:14	and , uh , what we try and do *T*-1 * \[ to , \+ to \] stick to our monthly budget is 0 we pretty much have , you know , the house payment , E_S
157753:63	and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know 0 we 're going *-1 to spend *T*-2 and set that money aside , E_S
157763:38	and we find out that , you know , no matter what kind of budget you stick on *T*-1 , there 's always going *-2 to be an unexpected car repair or something happen * with the house , that you have *-3 to have money *ICH*-6 for *T*-4 and , uh , not enough * to go and to take a loan out , but , uh , you have *-5 to have money for *T*-4 . E_S
157771:5	whatever *T*-1 's left over is \[ disposable in- , \+ \[ \[ disposable , \+ dis- , \] \+ yeah , discretionary \] income , \] that we use *T*-2 for the rest of the month , E_S
157831:14	But , uh , when we had the divorce *T*-1 , she just did n't get much money out of it and had *-2 to spend it all on *-3 getting another house . E_S
157848:9	well , what year are you in *T*-1 in college ? E_S
157866:27	\[ I , \+ I \] know how much my dad is going *-1 to give me *T*-2 every two weeks E_S
157896:11	That 's why I 'm in college *T*-1 . E_S
157910:20	\[ Who 's , \+ who 's *T*-1 \] not very well educated ? E_S
157924:13	So that 's why I 'm planning \[ and , \+ and \] preparing for the , uh , education of my children , also try and set that money aside *T*-1 . E_S
157929:4	What did you major in *T*-1 ? E_S
157944:5	How many kids do you have *T*-1 ? . E_S
157947:19	We , have three children who *T*-1 are eleven , nine , and eight . E_S
158051:13	So that 's how we spent most of the time with him *T*-1 . E_S
158103:42	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 working mothers or mothers who *T*-1 choose *-2 to work outside the home , um , need very early *-3 to come to grips with any guilt , that they feel *T*-4 and decide what *T*-5 's best for them and their family . E_S
158103:133	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 working mothers or mothers who *T*-1 choose *-2 to work outside the home , um , need very early *-3 to come to grips with any guilt , that they feel *T*-4 and decide what *T*-5 's best for them and their family . E_S
158110:17	And I feel 0 when my children were very young *T*-2 , I had jobs that *T*-1 helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing . E_S
158143:14	I was twenty-nine when I had my first child *T*-1 E_S
158157:46	and \[ I , \+ you \] can do that despite working very easily which *T*-1 is one of the things 0 I preach *T*-2 all the time \[ to , \+ to \] mothers . E_S
158202:69	Do you ever think that there 's a crime that *T*-1 's just so heinous and so bad that the person who *T*-2 commits this crime just does n't deserve *-3 to live anymore ? E_S
158205:49	Uh , \[ there would be a point , \+ there was a point \] where I would have said , no , that no one would deserve *-1 to die \[ for , \+ for \] a crime that he committed *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
158211:29	And , uh , * try and figure out what *T*-1 would be a suitable punishment . E_S
158220:135	\[ but , \+ but , \] \[ even , \+ even \] \[ in that circumstan- , \+ in that , uh , uh , situation \] \[ he would b- , \+ he would hope \] that there would be people around him who *T*-1 would , uh , keep him from *-2 \[ doing the , \+ doing the \] things . E_S
158227:76	Uh , \[ a- , \+ and \] that was the thing that , uh , *T*-1 killed Dukakis back , uh , four years ago when someone asked him a similar question *T*-2 E_S
158228:54	and \[ he , \+ he \] thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when , uh , people wanted *-1 to see if he was going *-2 to go for \[ an emotion \+ uh , a gut level \] reaction *T*-3 . E_S
158232:23	And I think that the people who *T*-1 are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level . E_S Uh , you know , whether it be a biblical force , uh , you know , the eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a life for a \[ knife , \+ life \] type logic or just , uh , uh , some sort of anger at * \[ putting peop- , \+ putting , uh , murderers \] up in federal pens for the rest of their life , uh , while we foot the bill . E_S
158239:16	Are they reformatories , where we 're trying *-1 to take people who *T*-2 ca n't survive \[ or , \+ or \] \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-3 are n't conforming enough to society so \[ that , \+ that \] we work well together *T*-4 . E_S

158243:60	Um , the death penalty surely fits in well \[ with , \+ uh , in \] a penal situation where you 're trying *-1 to punishment *T*-2 . E_S
158257:24	I do n't think 0 anyone who *T*-1 would commit \[ a , \+ uh , a \] crime that *T*-2 would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say , well , I was about *-3 to kill and dismember this person E_S
158285:4	What is your name *T*-1 by the way ? E_S
158292:142	\[ lot of , \+ lot of \] interesting procedural things 0 I think 0 *T*-2 would \[ be a good , \+ be a good \] change if we 're going *-1 to be talking about the subject \[ t- , \+ tonight \] which in some I guess criminal courts the , N_S

158343:85	It 's like they 're saying well on the one hand \[ they 're not , \+ he 's not \] getting a jury of his peers which *T*-1 is in some ways I think 0 *T*-2 true . E_S
158348:49	Uh , you know , they 're not going *-1 to do their job . Which *T*-2 is N_S
158360:7	So what 's the prevailing thought *T*-1 within the community ? E_S
158364:21	I mean you know , what the news media is going *-2 to make *T*-1 of it , E_S
158368:31	well , N_S I guess 0 it depends on who you talk to *T*-1 . E_S
158401:17	What about the judge who *T*-1 's hearing the case ? E_S
158425:35	\[ and , \+ and \] the judge gave the woman who *T*-1 \[ shot her , \+ shot the girl \] \[ a , \+ uh , uh , practically a \] suspended sentence . E_S
158439:14	That 's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences *T*-1 . E_S
158452:40	\[ you would know , \+ the whole world would know \] what you were facing *T*-1 . E_S
158463:46	and this is supposed *-1 to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who *T*-2 had two or three , um , centers , all over , you know , the , um , city E_S
158467:29	and they would , um , be one way when the parents were there *T*-1 and be another way when the parents left *T*-2 . E_S
158467:58	and they would , um , be one way when the parents were there *T*-1 and be another way when the parents left *T*-2 . E_S
158471:158	So , um , I think 0 \[ you need *-1 to make , \+ you know , if you \[ do , \+ do \] day care centers , you know you should make \] frequent checks \[ and , \+ \] um , *-2 to check in on them when they 're not expecting it *T*-3 . E_S
158475:34	Because they \[ do , \+ do \] things differently when you 're not around *T*-1 , E_S
158480:73	the things that we kind of looked at *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] 0 you want *-2 to see how many teachers you have *T*-3 . \[ And , \+ and \] how many kids they have *T*-4 and how they break it up *T*-5 . E_S
158480:110	the things that we kind of looked at *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] 0 you want *-2 to see how many teachers you have *T*-3 . \[ And , \+ and \] how many kids they have *T*-4 and how they break it up *T*-5 . E_S

158516:27	one time I picked up this little boy who *T*-1 was crying E_S
158529:4	what is your problem *T*-1 . E_S
158594:47	they 're just there . You know . *-1 Going through this routine , which *T*-2 is lousy . E_S
158639:36	you probably heard \[ where , \+ you know , where \] you stand in front of the clock and get your power back *-1 to control yourself *T*-2 . E_S
158647:21	Uh , I ca n't remember what they call it *T*-1 actually E_S

158661:4	What do you think *T*-1 , Mark ? E_S

158732:7	Well what do y- , N_S
158737:40	I pretty much question \[ or \+ \] \[ what , \+ what \] the U S -s motives *ICH*-2 were *T*-1 \[ \[ in , uh , \+ in , \] \+ in \] actually the original involvement . E_S
158762:4	Where a lot w- , N_S
158764:100	Well , do you think that , uh , we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and , uh , you know , move on into Kuwait and see what *T*-1 happens ? E_S
158793:84	Um , you know , \[ \[ over , \+ over \] the , \+ uh , \[ over , \+ over \] \[ what , \+ what \] \] *T*-1 probably wo n't \[ accomplish him , \+ accomplish much for him \] politically . E_S

159220:51	\[ I have , \+ so I have \] *-1 to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid *-5 *T*-2 real *T*-3 , you know , because if I was working somewhere else I 'd have *-4 to , you know , pay an extra five percent , or so . E_S

159226:51	and they 've just raised the , um , income caps on Social Security to the point where \[ you have *-1 to be pretty , \+ you have *-2 to be pretty \] well off before you stop *-4 \[ paying \+ paying \] that as well *T*-3 . E_S
159259:19	So , uh , Mike , what are your opinions on , uh , trial by jury *T*-1 ? E_S
159271:33	but * leave it up to the more experienced person who *T*-1 knows how it fits *T*-2 into the , uh , kind of the rate for different MUMBLEx . N_S
159271:44	but * leave it up to the more experienced person who *T*-1 knows how it fits *T*-2 into the , uh , kind of the rate for different MUMBLEx . N_S
159274:32	Each individual jury really does n't have any perception of what , um , \[ the going , \+ you know , if you will *?* the going , \] uh , award should be *T*-1 for a certain type of case , you know , within some kind of range . E_S
159278:4	When you get one way out like that *T*-1 N_S
159280:5	Who it really penalizes *T*-1 is their insurance company which *T*-2 then translates into higher rates for all of us . If they get some of those mega awards against them . E_S

159296:9	Well , how do you feel *T*-2 about * setting , like , well , for example , \[ a car type accident where , \+ uh , or some incident \] where someone loses a limb *T*-1 . E_S
159296:94	Well , how do you feel *T*-2 about * setting , like , well , for example , \[ a car type accident where , \+ uh , or some incident \] where someone loses a limb *T*-1 . E_S
159307:87	I think 0 maybe you look at , uh , the age of the person and their station in life \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , how much longer *ICH*-2 they have *T*-1 of work years that they would have *-3 to put up , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] that *T*-4 . E_S
159313:16	And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing *T*-2 because they can be schooled *-1 in that kind of thing , E_S
159334:50	Unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which *T*-1 is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages *T*-2 , E_S

159392:50	I was talking about only losses that *T*-1 are judged *-2 for a punitive damage which *T*-3 is another category of ,
159393:45	the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person 's actual injuries and what they are due *T*-2 . E_S
159394:44	And then they are awarding a second amount *ICH*-2 as punishment to the company which *T*-1 is \[ a l- , \+ usually a lot \] less . E_S
159449:51	So , uh , \[ she , \+ she 's \] real interested in , uh , what Ann Richards has been doing *T*-1 . E_S
159458:31	and she 's really cracking down on restrictions and what *T*-1 goes on in nursing homes . E_S

159521:18	you get one person who *T*-1 's a little bit dishonest working in there E_S
159539:19	They did n't care about what *T*-1 went on . E_S
159572:111	the elderly are very , you know , complaining because they remember the way that things used *-3 to be *T*-1 . And remember *-4 being able *-5 to do things *ICH*-6 for themselves which , you know , they no longer can *?* *T*-2 . E_S
159602:4	How 's he handling that *T*-1 ? E_S
159620:9	Well , what were you saying *T*-1 ? E_S

159673:16	\[ Wh- , \+ what 's \] the old country music like *T*-1 ? E_S

159779:9	Well , how old are you *T*-1 ? E_S
159795:4	How old are you *T*-1 ? E_S

159835:13	So that 's what he grew up *-2 listening to *T*-1 . E_S
159841:44	so he grew up like in the late fifties E_S and you know , when they had \[ that , \+ the \] Elvis Presley music and stuff like that . And that kind of rock and roll *T*-1 E_S
159863:68	But , uh , \[ I could see why you went , \+ uh , you know , I could see why you were \] kind of sheltered *-1 I guess \[ from , \+ from \] music *T*-2 . E_S
159887:42	\[ what kind of music \[ is , \+ does \] \+ what songs does \] he play *T*-1 ? E_S

159998:18	and then the rest is whatever you want *-1 to put *T*-2 in . If you put more than that or something like that . E_S
160004:9	Now , how long does it take *T*-1 for your contribution to vest ? E_S
160017:25	Huh , well , I guess 0 what we have *T*-1 is \[ like a f- , \+ what they call *T*-2 a flex \] benefits plan where \[ you , \+ you \] get like a certain amount of dollars E_S and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need *T*-1 *T*-3 . E_S

160028:19	well , it depends on which company you work for *T*-1 . E_S

160040:169	and , uh I \[ had , \+ wound up *-2 having \] *-3 to pay for , you know , a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because \[ of , \+ \] you know , \[ no , \+ no \] insurance policy happened *-1 to cover it , which *T*-4 is , N_S
160064:21	my place you get two weeks when you start *T*-1 E_S
160090:21	it 's the Bell Corps , which *T*-1 is , uh , N_S
160120:48	\[ there 's always , \+ they 're always \] laying people off , which *T*-2 is another benefit that you can have *T*-1 other than salary is trade that off for security . E_S

160153:75	And , uh , I guess , uh , 0 first and foremost , \[ it , \+ really it 's \] a question of what *ICH*-3 the student wants *-1 to have *T*-2 in the way of a career and then , uh , uh , which colleges or universities *T*-4 can best offer that program , E_S

160203:98	Uh , you know , I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities *ICH*-3 , particularly as they get *-1 to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is , uh , is right on campus as well *T*-2 E_S
160213:35	\[ I , \+ I \] go to Georgia Tech which *T*-1 is , you know , primarily an engineering school E_S

160310:34	\[ I , \+ I \] really do n't know what the details are *T*-1 . E_S

160583:4	What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
160625:26	I get a NEWSWEEK *ICH*-2 every week which \[ I , \+ I \] pretty much read *T*-1 that cover to cover E_S

160638:26	the news is n't , like , immediate what you 'd generally think of *T*-1 as news , E_S
160655:4	where they 're just trying *-1 to fill in *T*-2 . E_S
160662:41	Uh , I get kind of bored *-2 watching T V actually , when I watch the news on T V *T*-1 because it goes so slow E_S
160674:29	\[ that , \+ that 's \] about what it ends up *-1 being *T*-2 . E_S

160687:72	I mean \[ what do you , \+ \[ what , \+ what \] do you \] find *T*-1 interesting versus what do you find *T*-2 boring ? E_S
160689:39	Well right now trying *-1 to keep abreast of , uh , what *T*-2 's going on in Europe , you know , with all the , U S S R 's satellites breaking off , trying *-3 to become independent and , you know , European community coming together . E_S
160725:91	and , uh , I know of at least one company that *T*-1 specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it came time *T*-2 . E_S
160738:10	because , when they first start off *T*-1 , they 're going *-2 to be highly protectionist E_S
160752:45	and \[ they 're , \+ they 've \] all got their own reasons which *T*-1 have *-2 to be resolved *-3 yet . E_S
160775:9	Uh , what is the , uh , N_S
160828:4	Which *T*-1 is probably pretty nice , E_S
160837:5	what there is *T*-1 , is very high property taxes because that 's how they fund schools and everything *T*-2 . E_S
160837:44	what there is *T*-1 , is very high property taxes because that 's how they fund schools and everything *T*-2 . E_S
160880:107	Oh , \[ \[ I , \+ I mean , I , \] \+ I 'd \] consider twenty percent lucky because \[ just on , \+ I mean , you know , when you figure out just on \] feds *T*-1 , you know , I actually hit the thirty-one bracket this year , which *T*-2 was no fun . E_S

160906:4	which *T*-1 is just outrageous E_S
160911:110	well , \[ \[ I , \+ I mean , \] \+ I think \] 0 \[ there 's some people , \+ there , \[ y- , \+ \] certainly are some things \] where you need infrastructure *T*-1 E_S
160948:31	and , you know , then you look at how well they 're managed *-2 *T*-1 , you know , E_S
160956:43	and our taxes just are going *-1 to keep *-2 rising no matter what *T*-3 happens E_S
160957:10	and especially when you 've got the Bush administration who *T*-1 has increased government expenditures , uh , beyond what any other President since World War Two has done *T*-2 *T*-3 E_S
160957:32	and especially when you 've got the Bush administration who *T*-1 has increased government expenditures , uh , beyond what any other President since World War Two has done *T*-2 *T*-3 E_S

160971:117	I mean , I just read something that , two thirds or three quarters , I 'm not exactly sure of our national debt \[ are , \+ was \] created *-1 during the Reagan Bush *ICH*-3 era who *T*-2 are \[ suppo- , \+ supposedly \] fiscally conservative . E_S
161001:82	So , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] very hard * to say , you know , this is what we should cut *T*-2 . E_S
161014:4	Who *T*-1 are n't contributing . E_S
161025:32	I 'm glad 0 I 'm not the one who *T*-1 has *-2 to come up with these policies . E_S
161030:9	But , what *T*-1 's very funny is 0 in our town meeting they were v- , N_S
161031:88	\[ \[ th- , \+ this , \] \+ this \] guy \[ had , \+ both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had \] this proposal which , unfortunately *T*-1 violates New Hampshire constitution \[ d- , \+ \] for our local town to \[ do it to , \+ \] uh , \[ have you , \+ have people \] line item their taxes . E_S
161075:66	Well , the Schnauzer \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] watching for one of , uh , the managers where I work *T*-1 E_S
161081:43	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] I had just got the kitten when he asked me that *T*-1 E_S
161114:4	what was the other dog 0 you had *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
161173:53	\[ \[ I , \+ I 'd , \] \+ I \] really do n't know what the best pet is *T*-1 . E_S
161177:35	I guess 0 it 's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal *T*-1 . E_S
161205:9	Well , how do they become s- , N_S
161207:4	how did they get their reputation *T*-1 , then ? E_S
161341:28	the , uh , subject is child care and how * to determine child care *T*-1 , E_S
161354:38	and , uh , it 's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities *T*-1 . E_S
161374:69	I think 0 it 's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff , is qualification of people who *T*-1 work there ,
161375:21	and in * hiring people who *T*-2 would work at \[ the , uh , day care , \+ the child care \] facility * was very difficult * to find qualified people , uh , in terms of , not \[ just , \+ just \] N_S
161381:96	As a matter of fact , I believe that the safety \[ and , \+ and \] health , uh , issues , uh , depend in a very direct way on the people who *T*-1 are working with the children . E_S
161394:35	and I did n't want *-1 to run an institution where that was the case *T*-2 , where all 0 we were doing *T*-3 were warehousing *T*-4 because the first four , five years or so important E_S
161394:56	and I did n't want *-1 to run an institution where that was the case *T*-2 , where all 0 we were doing *T*-3 were warehousing *T*-4 because the first four , five years or so important E_S
161396:44	and \[ that , \+ that \] includes , uh , an atmosphere in which the child is safe \[ and , \+ and \] he 's watched *-1 and his physical needs are cared for *-2 *T*-3 , E_S
161400:5	when a couple has a child *T*-2 , then \[ they should both take , \+ you say 0 the first four or five years are the most important , and I think 0 I would agree with that , they both take \] four or five years off and devote to parenting . E_S
161423:10	and so what that means *T*-1 is 0 you do n't have *-2 to be physically powerful *-3 to work . E_S
161438:10	So , what kind of music you into *T*-1 ? E_S
161458:64	but , uh , \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , basic point of heavy metal \[ w- , \+ which \] *T*-1 seems *-2 to be music 0 *T*-3 to annoy you , \[ is , \+ uh , gets \] a little annoying . E_S
161544:7	and what *T*-1 gets me even more is the attitude of people who *T*-2 are really into classical music , and feel that \[ if , \+ if \] it 's not seventy five years old , it has n't stood the test of time . E_S
161544:42	and what *T*-1 gets me even more is the attitude of people who *T*-2 are really into classical music , and feel that \[ if , \+ if \] it 's not seventy five years old , it has n't stood the test of time . E_S

161690:44	\[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it \] was heavy when we were there *T*-1 though . E_S

161734:16	\[ what , \+ what \] major city *T*-1 is nearby ? E_S

161808:39	Well , actually , \[ I , \+ I 've \] known how * to sail *T*-1 pretty much my whole life . E_S

161819:37	\[ it , \+ it 's \] kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while , you know , uh , just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works *T*-1 \[ and , \+ and \] the physics behind it *T*-2 . E_S

161826:32	but some people are more motorboaters , you know which *T*-1 is fine . E_S

161866:22	\[ What kind of , \+ what lake \] do you all use *T*-1 ? E_S

161982:52	\[ I wonder , \+ I mean , I wonder \] \[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 really is the answer . E_S

162118:29	We 've got methadone programs where people who *T*-1 desperately want *-2 to get off drugs ca n't get onto the program *T*-3 . E_S
162129:7	and what he , N_S
162133:10	Well , what he wants *-1 to do *T*-2 is * take all the money that , uh , he gets *T*-3 for drug enforcement and use it for , uh , drug education . E_S
162141:59	* Stop *-1 trying *-3 to attack supply \[ because , \+ \] \[ which , \+ which \] to some extent *T*-2 makes sense and to some extent *T*-2 does n't . E_S
162143:31	and , you know , they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park *T*-1 E_S
162155:42	Uh , so I 'm looking at , uh , something larger than what we have *T*-1 . E_S
162160:4	which *T*-1 are both kind of small . E_S
162199:7	but when I bought the car that I bought *T*-1 now *T*-2 , I did that also E_S
162233:64	actually \[ the , \+ the \] car that I really like *T*-1 right now is an Eagle Talon , which *T*-2 is an American car . E_S
162241:52	Uh , because I have \[ a , \+ an \] economy car *ICH*-2 right now , which *T*-1 is okay , E_S
162260:5	when I bought the car that I bought *T*-1 *T*-2 , I was looking for mileage , E_S
162273:43	but it , you know depends on \[ what you , \+ what you \] pay *T*-1 initially . E_S
162316:32	and that was , I think 0 *-2 , what *T*-1 really prejudiced me against American cars \[ was \+ \] because I did not feel that it was a very quality , uh , car . E_S
162338:4	Which *T*-1 is a good deal . E_S
162347:16	fourteen to sixteen is what they go for *T*-1 on the lot , E_S
162357:108	\[ \[ \[ I do n't know what kind of , \+ I do n't know what G M corporate , \] \+ kind of hit the , \] \+ I do n't know what kind of hit \] they take *T*-1 on it , E_S
162378:19	Uh , so , uh , what are your benefits like *T*-1 at your job , E_S
162379:6	and how do you feel *T*-1 about them ? E_S
162387:134	and \[ I 'm actually making just about as much as , \+ you know , I 'm \[ m- , \+ making \] actually \[ over average , \+ over the average \] \] for my career , my experience and all that stuff which *T*-1 kind of surprised me . E_S
162395:5	What kind of a degree have you got *T*-1 ? E_S
162408:84	\[ that , \+ that 's \] pretty generous , although you have *-1 to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which *T*-2 is , kind of \[ a , \+ a \] pain , E_S
162421:4	How long have you been with them *T*-1 ? E_S
162528:5	What we have *-1 to do *T*-2 is , we have *-3 to pay , uh , about twenty percent of \[ our , \+ uh , uh , our \] costs E_S
162534:77	\[ and , \+ uh , but , \] you know \[ the- , \+ there \] are other things that you get *T*-1 when you work for the government *T*-2 \[ \[ i- , \+ uh , in , \] \+ in \] terms of , uh , more relaxed atmosphere . E_S
162538:103	It *EXP*-3 's really nice \[ * to be , \+ for me , anyway , * to be \] able *-4 to work in , uh , a research atmosphere , uh , where I do n't have *-1 to , uh , uh , you know , worry about , uh , academics or anything like that *T*-2 , E_S
162564:20	because I have a cousin whose husband *T*-1 works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area . E_S
162594:25	In fact , I know a guy who *T*-1 works at Andover \[ who *T*-2 used * to work , \+ who I used *-4 to work \] with *T*-5 out here E_S
162594:72	In fact , I know a guy who *T*-1 works at Andover \[ who *T*-2 used * to work , \+ who I used *-4 to work \] with *T*-5 out here E_S
162604:7	So how serious is the , subject of crime *T*-1 in your area ? E_S
162617:69	and they 're starting *-2 to , uh , get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school *T*-1 , of all things . E_S
162639:12	That 's how \[ they , \+ uh , they \] bind themselves together in groups *T*-2 , I guess 0 *T*-1 E_S
162663:46	They just wait for you to show up after they 've picked out which one they want *T*-1 . E_S
162698:56	And we 've just come from twenty years in the military \[ and , \+ \] uh , which *T*-1 is an entirely different environment , E_S
162708:18	And it 's pretty bad when they 're using metal detectors in school *T*-1 E_S
162713:4	what do you do *T*-2 * \[ to , \+ to \] reduce crime \[ in a , \+ in a \] major city like D C where it 's a way of life for everybody *T*-1 . E_S
162713:85	what do you do *T*-2 * \[ to , \+ to \] reduce crime \[ in a , \+ in a \] major city like D C where it 's a way of life for everybody *T*-1 . E_S
162715:28	I do n't know \[ what , \+ what \] the solution is *T*-1 . E_S
162717:13	and that 's what *T*-1 's causing all the killing . E_S
162722:45	uh , most of them are fairly , uh , radical in terms of what you 'd have *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
162747:63	and , uh , I think , uh , 0 to a large extent , they do n't understand the concept that what they 're doing *T*-3 is actually illegal because this is the way 0 they were raised *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
162816:16	I do n't know what they saw *T*-1 in me , E_S
162821:49	at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted , especially in cases in which there 's no smoking gun *T*-1 . E_S
162822:35	But , there , too , there are also cases in which I feel 0 a majority rule might be acceptable *T*-1 , particularly , I think in civil cases . E_S
162826:41	Well , uh , could you give me an example of a case where you think that *T*-1 ? E_S
162828:33	Well , in a criminal case , say one in which , you know , there is , like , say assault or some such *T*-1 . I think 0 there ought *-2 to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this . E_S
162845:60	Uh , as it stands , \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] many ways and means by which a person can be set *-1 up *T*-2 , both , uh , in a \[ civil , \+ uh , civil \] and criminal case . E_S
162852:17	A , uh , fellow when he was much younger *T*-2 , uh , was tried *-1 and convicted *-1 and sentenced *-1 to death . E_S
162854:77	\[ and , \+ uh , so \] he served out \[ his , \+ his \] sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who *T*-1 was making a documentary called * the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded *-2 through the judicial system . E_S
162858:52	Well , I mean , I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served *-2 *T*-1 . E_S
162865:44	and I also think , just like you were talking about *ICH*-1 before , why you were chosen *-3 to be on a jury *T*-2 that , uh , \[ \[ the , \+ just , \] \+ the \] process of * picking jurors is not always objective . E_S
162869:52	And , you know , they like *-1 to think that they 're getting someone who *T*-2 's objective in all this , E_S
162870:26	but they 're really looking for someone who *T*-1 will pretty much fulfill the lawyers ' desires . E_S
162875:41	and then \[ you , \+ you 're \] either challenged *-2 which *T*-1 is , N_S you know ,
162880:43	and then you have *-1 to give a reason *ICH*-2 to the court why you ca n't serve *T*-3 . E_S
162887:10	So , What kind of experience *ICH*-2 \[ do you , \+ do you \] have *T*-1 , then with child care ? E_S
162922:38	and she was worrying about *-1 going back to work and what she was going *-2 to do *T*-3 with him and the different , N_S
162939:37	but I used *-2 to work \[ and , \+ \] when I had two children *T*-1 . E_S
162944:22	but I do n't envy anybody who *T*-1 's in that situation 0 * to find day care *T*-2 . E_S
162954:17	He had a boss who , uh , *T*-1 moved into a larger office E_S
162988:26	so there are a lot of people who *T*-1 babysit in their homes that , you know , N_S
162989:26	you either know them or know somebody who *T*-1 knows them , 0 *T*-4 to get *-2 to , N_S
163007:66	and , course , there 's a lot of different types of day care available *ICH*-2 , too , you know , where they teach them academic things *T*-1 . E_S
163027:4	when he starts *-1 toddling around and stuff *T*-2 . E_S
163033:42	\[ \[ When , \+ when he 's not , \] \+ when she ca n't \] keep control of him *T*-1 E_S
163058:10	Well , when you have kids *T*-1 , will you work ? E_S
163073:10	Is that what you do *T*-1 ? E_S
163081:9	oh , what 's that called *-2 *T*-1 , E_S
163124:5	What they do *T*-1 is they have , uh , three judges , basically . E_S
163133:15	I think 0 what they need *-2 to do *T*-1 is , they need *-3 to somehow take the money out of it . E_S
163146:8	And what they 've done *T*-1 is they 've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they 've done *T*-2 , E_S
163146:57	And what they 've done *T*-1 is they 've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they 've done *T*-2 , E_S
163153:12	they know what *T*-1 's good and what *T*-2 is n't *?* , E_S
163153:28	they know what *T*-1 's good and what *T*-2 is n't *?* , E_S
163156:48	and , you know , you would n't have this , uh , uh , theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it \[ to the , \+ to the \] jury *T*-1 E_S
163186:6	So where do you think 0 they target their efforts *T*-1 ? E_S
163193:9	Well , How would you go about *-2 changing it *T*-1 ? E_S
163206:45	I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to leave those details like , what would you do *T*-3 about , N_S
163216:50	Well , you know , uh , * talking about the lawyers , you know what *T*-1 might very well \[ do , \+ uh , cause \] \[ a , \+ uh , a \] drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is * to set the fees for cases . E_S
163232:8	because when you get the most heinous of crimes *T*-1 , have you ever noticed 0 you always get the most renowned defense attorney ? E_S
163244:4	Who *T*-1 's paying for that ? E_S
163256:21	\[ and , \+ and \] when you stop and look at it *T*-1 , I mean , the judges , \[ th- , \+ they 're \] all former lawyers . E_S
163289:54	I think 0 at each Wal-Mart , they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that , which *T*-1 now , N_S
163325:66	I just know that , uh , my in-laws \[ up in , \+ up in \] Oklahoma , that 's how \[ they do , \+ you know , they pick \] it up *T*-1 , E_S
163341:103	You know , all kinds of bottles \[ \[ they , \+ they , \] \+ they \] really charge people \[ * to , \+ \] I guess 0 *T*-3 when you purchase them *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and then \] when you turn them back in *T*-1 . E_S
163341:139	You know , all kinds of bottles \[ \[ they , \+ they , \] \+ they \] really charge people \[ * to , \+ \] I guess 0 *T*-3 when you purchase them *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and then \] when you turn them back in *T*-1 . E_S
163345:46	\[ I n- , \+ I \] remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel *T*-1 . E_S
163362:21	I was like , God , how much were those bottles *T*-1 you know ? E_S
163379:33	It 's pretty dangerous out there , you know , when they fall over *T*-1 , E_S
163430:9	Well , who *T*-1 wants *-2 to clean their junk before they throw it away . E_S
163445:17	I have no idea how long this is supposed *-1 to last *T*-2 or anything . E_S
163489:48	Actually , uh , they just recently started a policy of * testing drugs , which *T*-1 was kind of interesting , E_S
163490:20	because \[ w- , \+ when \] I went *-1 to work for them *T*-2 , uh , they did n't do that , E_S
163532:4	What is the nature of your company 's business *T*-1 ? E_S
163538:15	we have engineers who , uh , *T*-1 go out \[ to the oil well , \+ \[ to the , \+ to the \] client 's oil well , \] \[ and , \+ and \] work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff , E_S
163539:42	so the clients are very concerned that , you know , the engineers who *T*-1 go out there are adhering to their drug policy , because they 're on \[ their , \+ their , \] you know , territory and everything , E_S
163551:27	In our case , it 's like , when you hire on *T*-1 , they 'll test you , E_S
163558:43	Particularly , like , uh , we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol *T*-1 , E_S
163570:13	my brother lives where I work *T*-1 , E_S
163589:18	Uh , particularly , like where we are *T*-1 , you know . E_S
163591:43	there was a story of a woman last year \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 actually did slip on the ice \[ and , \+ and \] like sprained her ankle E_S
163603:29	but , uh , I had an experience *ICH*-2 when I was interviewing for a job *T*-1 \[ that , \+ \] where I had *-4 to , uh , uh , do a drug test *T*-3 E_S
163603:69	but , uh , I had an experience *ICH*-2 when I was interviewing for a job *T*-1 \[ that , \+ \] where I had *-4 to , uh , uh , do a drug test *T*-3 E_S
163605:45	but \[ it was , \+ it was \] just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through *T*-1 , E_S
163615:21	\[ and , \+ and \] when I got in there *T*-1 , \[ I did n't , \+ I was n't , \] like , able *-2 to give a full sample , E_S
163629:34	\[ \[ or , \+ or , \] \+ or \] what do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
163649:56	\[ and , \+ and \] supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn 0 * to retire *T*-1 *T*-2 , the money will be there for us . E_S
163655:22	\[ when I , \+ when I \] see that money taken * out of my paycheck \[ \[ each , \+ each \] week , I , \+ or \[ each , \+ every \] other week *T*-3 , \[ I , \+ I \] \] really think 0 that money 's history E_S
163673:26	I 'm not sure if we know what * to do *T*-2 in terms of * curing some who *T*-1 has already gotten polio . E_S
163673:64	I 'm not sure if we know what * to do *T*-2 in terms of * curing some who *T*-1 has already gotten polio . E_S
163685:134	\[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] funny because , uh , it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard *-1 to get ahold of *T*-2 is the line item veto where , uh , you know , Congress is able *-3 to attach all kinds of , uh , funny amendments for individual , uh , \[ c- , \+ congressional \] districts \[ to the , \+ to the \] main budget proposals *T*-4 E_S
163701:7	And whenever there 's that kind of subjective judgment *T*-2 , there 's always going *-3 to be a dispute as to , uh , \[ where the exa- , \+ where the boundary \] between waste \[ and , \+ and \] necessity is *T*-1 . E_S
163701:97	And whenever there 's that kind of subjective judgment *T*-2 , there 's always going *-3 to be a dispute as to , uh , \[ where the exa- , \+ where the boundary \] between waste \[ and , \+ and \] necessity is *T*-1 . E_S
163720:14	and , uh , when Dukakis vetoed certain things *T*-1 , there was a big uproar and was n't necessarily so popular . E_S
163723:24	but Massachusetts \[ was n't , \+ when Dukakis was there , anyway *T*-1 , was n't \] in that great shape financially . E_S
163753:29	Uh , well , I do n't know exactly what *T*-1 's hot down in Texas . E_S
163754:11	I know what *T*-1 's hot down here with me , E_S
163757:16	and that 's usually what *T*-1 's hot around here E_S
163758:25	\[ so , \+ So , \] what kind of music do you like *T*-1 ? E_S
163785:27	so uh , classic rock for me is what I have *T*-1 , which *T*-2 is like , uh , Doors , Eagles , Jimmy Hendrix . E_S
163785:43	so uh , classic rock for me is what I have *T*-1 , which *T*-2 is like , uh , Doors , Eagles , Jimmy Hendrix . E_S
163834:54	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't care for it at all , that Texas twang or whatever you want *-1 to call it *T*-2 . E_S
163866:46	But they 're not in it *-1 to say anything or give a message which *T*-2 is what they were do- , N_S
163866:57	But they 're not in it *-1 to say anything or give a message which *T*-2 is what they were do- , N_S

163908:60	so \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it *EXP*-2 's \] really backwards how things are working now *T*-1 E_S

163927:51	I know for myself that , uh , for the most part , I do n't know which artist *T*-1 is which , E_S
163934:45	and then if I really like the song , eventually I 'll figure out who it was *T*-1 . E_S
163938:14	that 's about how I am *T*-1 on popular music . E_S
163940:35	uh , everything 0 I listen to *T*-1 is what I buy *T*-2 , not whatever they play *T*-3 on the radio E_S

163943:29	Well , you have *-1 to figure out what * to buy *T*-2 , E_S
163995:26	Uh , well , I 'm not sure how it is in Georgia *T*-1 , E_S
164001:28	Uh , I guess 0 nineteen ninety is when it start *-2 to drop off *T*-1 , E_S
164002:26	and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher *T*-1 . E_S
164009:10	Uh , what kind of crime problem do you usually run into *T*-1 ? E_S
164012:39	Well , uh , the least , \[ what , \+ from what *T*-2 's \] on the news , uh , there are very few , like actual robberies reported * , uh , uh , \[ of , \+ of \] residences . E_S
164013:5	What *T*-1 's more likely *-2 to occur is , uh , \[ robbery of , \+ uh , you know , * knocking over \] \[ a , \+ a \] small store or a car theft , you know , \[ it , \+ \] things of that nature . E_S
164029:17	There were one case where , uh , this one guy , uh , was taking women from the teller \[ and , \+ and , \] you know , making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time , raping them all *T*-1 , E_S
164061:74	but \[ I , \+ I \] do n't really think 0 those things happen too often because , like I said , from what *T*-1 's reported *-2 in the news , at least , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] not all that common . E_S
164086:127	But , even so , \[ \[ it , \+ I mean , it 's , \] \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates \[ to , \+ to \] like lock the doors when they go out *T*-2 , you know , and things like that . E_S
164093:36	Uh , it *EXP*-3 would be so easy for someone who *T*-1 is motivated *-4 to do so to just , you know , sit out back , take a look at when people are here *T*-2 and when they 're not *?* *T*-5 just come in , you know , E_S
164093:104	Uh , it *EXP*-3 would be so easy for someone who *T*-1 is motivated *-4 to do so to just , you know , sit out back , take a look at when people are here *T*-2 and when they 're not *?* *T*-5 just come in , you know , E_S

164106:25	but you 'd be surprised *ICH*-1 also how , much people *ICH*-3 watch you *T*-2 that *T*-4 even not , uh , participating in any type crime . E_S
164148:42	\[ What do you think 0 you 'll , \+ uh , what kind of a car do you think 0 you 'll \] buy *T*-1 next ? E_S
164154:125	but , uh , realistically with , uh , the need * to take the kids to school , * probably have *-1 to have something that , uh , *T*-2 would n't wined up *-3 putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat *T*-4 . E_S
164168:14	and , uh , whatever I get *T*-1 , I want *-2 to have , uh , air bags , uh , both driver 's and passenger side and four door because it 's much more convenient *ICH*-4 if you 're carrying anybody \[ to , \+ \] you know , rather than * have them stoop down *-3 to get over , E_S
164198:22	but there 's so many occasions when I 've had *-1 to move some members of the family or do this or that *T*-2 , E_S
164220:10	A case where there was a , sort of freak ice storm *T*-1 E_S
164229:22	\[ What kind of , \+ what make \] is the mini van *T*-1 ? E_S

164353:16	\[ What , \+ what \] do you think 0 *T*-1 \[ is , \+ uh , is \] an appropriate , uh , punishment for \[ some of the various , \+ \] you know , \[ such as , \+ things such as \] rape \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , murder or something like that . E_S

165416:7	and what I was surprised at *T*-1 is that on my little Nissan
165423:40	You know , they 've gotten to the point that \[ where \+ \] they do n't weigh very much *T*-1 E_S
165478:10	So , when I changed those over *T*-1 , I put on \[ these , \+ these \] pressed aluminum things E_S

165760:36	\[ and , \+ uh , but \] I think 0 when we were back at your age *T*-1 , we did n't have much of a budget E_S
165769:28	Uh , \[ but \+ uh , but \] what do you do *T*-1 ? E_S

165821:38	And , uh , supposedly , they 've got great customer satisfaction from what things I 've heard *T*-1 . E_S
165837:19	but that 's the person who *T*-1 's working on it , E_S
165858:7	And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that *T*-1 , I just say I will never do that with the modern cars . E_S
165905:47	I 've driven some , uh , Tauruses *ICH*-2 over the last couple of years when I 've been on business trips *T*-1 . Uh , as rental cars . E_S
165914:35	and this is out in California \[ where , \+ where \] they do n't make a car that *T*-1 's got reasonable performance anymore *T*-2 . E_S
165945:4	What do you call it *T*-1 ? E_S
165968:23	\[ What do you , \+ what do you \] looking for *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] those ? E_S

166006:4	What is your , uh , community , uh , currently doing *T*-1 with regard to recycling ? E_S
166023:21	So a lot of the people who *T*-1 live up front do n't bother *-2 to recycle because , you know , it *EXP*-3 's too far * to carry the stuff to the other bins . E_S
166032:5	Where people are n't really , you know , eco conscious *T*-3 . It 's just the fact that it 's something 0 they have *-2 to do *T*-1 . E_S
166058:148	I think 0 here \[ if they , \+ uh , instead of * just , you know , requiring that you \[ put , \+ put \] out the trash and stuff , if they *ICH*-2 \] could get some kind of rebate , those people who *T*-1 do put the stuff out , uh , you know , and separate it , have lower collection fee or something * may encourage people to separate . E_S
166074:40	I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] what they need *-1 to do *T*-2 . * Be more proactive like that . E_S
166085:7	and what they 'll do *T*-1 is they 'll recycle it . E_S
166106:9	uh , what do you think 0 *T*-2 was different *ICH*-1 ten years ago from now ? E_S
166119:9	Uh , what do you think *T*-1 about that ? E_S
166151:21	Well , \[ how , \+ how \] old are you *T*-1 ? E_S
166168:22	It 's just a matter where priorities are , \[ at \+ \] placed *-1 *T*-2 . And that , uh , usually as far as families are concerned , there used *-3 to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home . E_S
166206:138	And then there , \[ th- , \+ \] \[ is , \+ is \] that other group that *T*-1 is working *-2 to maintain a standard of living that , uh , they think 0 *T*-4 \[ is , \+ is \] surviving which *T*-3 is really more luxuries . E_S
166222:4	which group are you saying 0 *T*-1 is the one trying ? E_S
166224:86	I 'm saying that \[ the , \+ uh , the \] group that *T*-1 is just trying *-2 to survive from day to day , where both parents are working *T*-4 is more of the majority \[ than the , \+ than the \] people that *T*-3 have the higher standard of living . E_S
166228:43	Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who *T*-1 has the money and who *T*-2 the decreasing , uh , middle class in this country I think that that 's , in my opinion , the case . E_S
166228:61	Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who *T*-1 has the money and who *T*-2 the decreasing , uh , middle class in this country I think that that 's , in my opinion , the case . E_S
166258:46	I seem *-1 to be younger than most people \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-2 talk on this thing . E_S
166277:11	You know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
166286:17	and I certainly see how much *ICH*-2 I pay *T*-1 in real estate taxes every year . E_S
166302:96	But , uh , \[ \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't understand the , \] \+ uh , I do n't understand , \] I guess 0 *T*-1 , why the schools \[ don- , \+ \] seem *-2 to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities *T*-3 . E_S
166306:29	But then , again , I 'm not quite sure where the blame ought *-1 to be put *-1 *T*-2 . Uh , because \[ the , \+ the \] dropout rate is , in those areas , w- , N_S
166307:23	it 's high in those areas where also there 's poverty \[ and , \+ and \] crime *T*-1 . E_S
166309:80	And it seems like if you could eliminate one \[ of , \+ of \] the parts of that circle , \[ whether , \+ where \] you have the dropout rate and crime and , you know , general poverty kind of conditions *T*-1 , that things ought *-2 to get better . E_S
166312:85	but it 's just like , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't expect them to know \[ \[ which , \+ which , \] \+ which \] part *T*-1 is best 0 * to fix *T*-2 just like I do n't know . E_S
166320:24	Well , that 's I meant when I said the school *T*-2 . E_S
166370:9	But , when you 're \[ \[ talk- , \+ w- , \] \+ w- , \] N_S
166378:16	\[ Wh- , \+ what 's \] your , uh , N_S

166465:93	more , you know , players are apt *-1 to act a little bit different \[ \[ when they , \+ when their jobs and their , \] \+ when it 's a job \] and not just , you know N_S
166471:5	when you 're getting paid *-1 millions * to do it *T*-2 , \[ you ac- , \+ \] I think 0 they take it to another level . E_S
166482:16	\[ Who- , \+ who 's \] that *T*-1 ? E_S
166504:44	Well , \[ I can see , \+ I can see \] definitely how you get into that *T*-1 . E_S
166536:13	So , uh , what 's d- , N_S
166582:36	Uh , I guess 0 we 're the only ones , who *T*-1 take it that far . E_S
166606:4	whatever you want *-1 to call it *T*-2 there . E_S
166621:11	That 's why it 's \[ a go- , \+ a \] big college thing *T*-1 . E_S
166659:16	I do n't know how my Eagles are going *-1 to do this year *T*-2 . E_S
166671:13	Do you know where that is *T*-1 ? E_S
166704:70	Well , you know , \[ I \+ . I \] mean , \[ \[ who , \+ who \] \+ who \] the heck *T*-1 is going *-2 to root for Tampa Bay , right ? E_S
166731:84	Well , uh , one of the things \[ that , \+ uh , that \] I found *T*-1 to be , uh , an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card *T*-2 and they ask me *-3 to put my telephone number \[ on the , \+ on the , \] uh , credit card bill *T*-2 . E_S
166750:13	and I say what are you going *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
166778:18	but it 's another thing where it 's required *-1 by law *T*-2 E_S
166799:24	But it really makes you wonder what other lists *ICH*-5 *ICH*-6 you 're own *T*-1 that *T*-2 have been made *-3 , uh , public that you , do n't know about *T*-4 . E_S
166804:4	Whenever you donate money to someone *T*-1 ? E_S
166837:30	Uh , and that 's also happened to me where I 've given money to my old Alma Mater in college *T*-1 . E_S
166849:30	and they actually happen *-1 to be people who *T*-2 \[ are , \+ graduated \] in your class or something like that . E_S
166855:4	How do you know that *T*-1 ? E_S
166857:16	\[ Who , \+ how \] do you know that *T*-1 ? E_S
166858:16	\[ Why , \+ why \] you even telling me this *T*-1 ? E_S
166864:24	There 's no need for someone who *T*-1 is soliciting should know at all . E_S

166912:38	But , uh , my great-grandfather was put *-1 in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three *T*-2 . E_S
166926:57	And so \[ I , \+ you know , I \] guess 0 most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home *T*-1 , it 's more a case of where they are not able *-2 to look after their day-to-day needs *T*-3 . E_S
166926:111	And so \[ I , \+ you know , I \] guess 0 most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home *T*-1 , it 's more a case of where they are not able *-2 to look after their day-to-day needs *T*-3 . E_S
166939:24	I guess , N_S uh , 0 when I think nursing home *T*-1 I do think of people that *T*-2 are not able *-3 to \[ do , \+ take \] care of themselves physically . Uh , E_S
166944:18	Because I think 0 what they often get used *-1 as *T*-2 is , uh , almost like a very high level or long-term care \[ for , \+ \] uh , similar to a hospital . E_S
166950:103	Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer 's Disease \[ \[ or those \+ or , \] \+ or \] physical and mental handicaps . Uh , you know , where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind . Even though it may be minimal *T*-1 . E_S
166961:52	\[ I th- , \+ and I think \] 0 it happens more in areas where it 's , uh , I guess , uh , a broad social medical system where , uh , you know , there 's government medical care and that kind of thing *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
166961:97	\[ I th- , \+ and I think \] 0 it happens more in areas where it 's , uh , I guess , uh , a broad social medical system where , uh , you know , there 's government medical care and that kind of thing *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
166962:20	If it 's the lot where it 's funded *-1 by the individuals *T*-2 N_S
166993:42	it seems to me 0 I 'm always challenged *-2 peremptorily also when I go to these things *T*-1 . E_S

167026:15	So , that 's why the defense is there *-1 picking through them *T*-4 , whereas at the same time , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] prosecutor sitting there *-3 picking through them because he wants somebody who *T*-2 will give him , uh , a guilty verdict if the facts warrant . E_S

167043:78	but I think that it *EXP*-2 should be up to the judge and the , uh , lawyers * to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be *T*-1 . E_S
167047:31	Maybe just the judge because they 're the people who *T*-1 know what the system is *T*-2 and what it 's all about *T*-3 and believe in the system . E_S
167047:44	Maybe just the judge because they 're the people who *T*-1 know what the system is *T*-2 and what it 's all about *T*-3 and believe in the system . E_S
167047:62	Maybe just the judge because they 're the people who *T*-1 know what the system is *T*-2 and what it 's all about *T*-3 and believe in the system . E_S
167067:7	But when it comes to , uh , sentencing for punishment *T*-1 , of course , if the person 's never done anything bad before , according to the judicial system , then they 're going *-2 to lean towards a slightly more lenient side , E_S
167068:42	and the jury 's supposed *-1 to be notified *-2 of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury *T*-3 . E_S
167080:7	But when it comes to what kind of sentence you 're going *-1 to lay *T*-2 down *T*-3 , I think \[ that , \+ uh , that \] they should *?* . E_S
167080:22	But when it comes to what kind of sentence you 're going *-1 to lay *T*-2 down *T*-3 , I think \[ that , \+ uh , that \] they should *?* . E_S
167088:21	So , \[ you , \+ what you 're \] saying *T*-1 is this , if there is the second offense , then you execute them . E_S
167095:5	When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing *T*-2 , I 'm all for that for , uh , small crimes , infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that *T*-1 have gone to warrant , E_S
167112:25	You get a guy down the street who *T*-1 comes up , uh , *-2 carrying a kni- , N_S
167114:66	So , * let 's talk about the , uh , wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order *T*-1 E_S
167116:4	What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
167131:59	Uh , but \[ \[ \[ th- , \+ th- , \] \+ th- , \] \+ then \] why * not \[ pay , \+ pay \] the sales tax *T*-1 MUMBLEx . E_S
167133:4	why should an individual \[ just because it 's , \+ just because the state \] ca n't really find out about it , be able *-1 to avoid *-2 paying sales tax *T*-3 ? E_S
167135:60	Well , I mean , it seems to me that , generally , at least in my own experience , when I purchase something mail order *T*-2 , it 's not * to circumvent *-1 paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania . E_S
167142:56	And I think that it *EXP*-3 's not my responsibility * to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe 0 they are owed *-1 *T*-2 even though , you know , the revenue stream went to another state . E_S
167149:50	\[ \[ W- , \+ w- , \] \+ \[ fr- , \+ from \] what \] I understand *T*-3 from \[ \[ v- , \+ v- , \] \+ various \] net readings , \[ \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ it , \] \+ the Federal government \] is going *-1 to try *-2 to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes , uh , \[ in , \+ into \] place in the next few years . E_S
167158:4	Which *T*-1 is exactly what businesses do *T*-2 at the present . E_S
167158:18	Which *T*-1 is exactly what businesses do *T*-2 at the present . E_S
167174:61	But the accounting department will , uh , suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have *-1 to pay *T*-2 . E_S
167250:112	Well , one of the things 0 I was thinking about *T*-1 is , 0 uh , you know , from society 's point of view , if you put a value on each person , what you want *-2 to do *T*-3 is *-4 to maximize the end game value . E_S
167272:84	Another way 0 you could do it *T*-1 is * weight this value by , uh , the value to society of the people . Uh , which *T*-2 is pretty delicate thing 0 * to do *T*-3 . E_S
167274:41	So if this guy does n't make a great deal of money , which *T*-1 is often times the case , \[ then \+ then \] he 's obviously not worth very much E_S
167282:217	Of course , one of the things that *T*-1 happens if you use that algorithm , is 0 you find that \[ it 's more easy , \+ it *EXP*-4 's easier * \[ to , \+ uh , to , \] \] uh , terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going *-2 to be less . Which *T*-3 means ,
167301:32	uh , I know 0 I have a friend whose , uh , son *T*-1 was murdered *-2 , uh , on the night before his sixteenth birthday . E_S
167315:13	Did they find who *T*-1 killed him ? E_S
167330:30	That appeals process , I mean , it 's what , you know , *T*-1 really , you know , just drags out and out and out . E_S
167372:38	And this was \[ a , \+ a \] Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions *T*-1 E_S
167410:5	what *T*-1 happened was that \[ some of \[ the , \+ the \] wa- , \+ a lot of water \] settled on the top E_S
167456:22	So , uh , I mean what was it for *T*-1 ? E_S
167484:19	So \[ what , \+ why \] is it *EXP*-2 that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot *T*-1 . E_S
167488:5	Where you live *T*-1 it gets very hot ? E_S
167493:13	And that 's why you , N_S
167494:44	\[ an- , \+ and \] the windows \[ have you , \+ \] what type of windows are you putting *T*-1 in ? E_S
167503:16	\[ what , \+ what , \] are you putting *T*-1 in
167579:8	So , what is your , uh , family , N_S
167580:4	what do you usually do *T*-1 as far as budgeting ? E_S
167592:19	and we budget them into what we call *T*-1 \[ our , \+ our \] needs and wants list . E_S
167602:62	\[ And , \+ uh , and \] we 're continually putting into those , you know , each month how much we 're going *-1 to need *T*-2 E_S
167655:40	Well , a lot of that , uh , I do n't know how safe it is *T*-1 . E_S
167702:97	Because \[ \[ you 're , \+ you 've , \] \+ you 've \] sat down with a piece of paper and said well * let 's see what are we going *-1 to , N_S
167703:7	so what *T*-1 goes into \[ that , \+ that \] particular thing ? E_S
167709:20	we just averaged out how much *ICH*-3 last year we used *T*-1 per month on medical and how much we used *T*-2 on dental E_S
167709:59	we just averaged out how much *ICH*-3 last year we used *T*-1 per month on medical and how much we used *T*-2 on dental E_S
167721:19	And \[ when , \+ when \] we see something on sale *T*-1 , uh , instead of * just looking in our checking account and saying well we 've got enough and getting it , and then when something comes up *T*-2 , you know , kind of scrimping * to pay for a medical bill .

167721:115	And \[ when , \+ when \] we see something on sale *T*-1 , uh , instead of * just looking in our checking account and saying well we 've got enough and getting it , and then when something comes up *T*-2 , you know , kind of scrimping * to pay for a medical bill .

167731:24	Well , you know , uh , what do you do *T*-1 as far as , N_S
167740:18	And \[ how , \+ what 's \] that *T*-1 ? E_S
167746:18	\[ or \+ or \] how do you work that *T*-1 ? E_S
167762:89	Uh , you know , there are certain months of the year that you 'll spend more *ICH*-1 on food than other months *T*-3 . And certain times when that will be left *-2 over *T*-4 . E_S
167766:25	But that 's completely up to me how I do that *T*-1 . E_S
167777:39	and I also get my own money 0 * to do what I want *-2 to *?* *T*-1 . Go to lunches , you know , and do that kind of thing *T*-3 . E_S
167781:70	We have a clothing , uh , envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure 0 we need *T*-1 each month on clothing *T*-2 . E_S
167804:13	and we know which month we 'll enough *ICH*-1 saved * * to go *-2 buy those . E_S
167833:17	I got a friend who *T*-1 goes there , by the way . E_S
167859:4	What d- , N_S
167872:42	I mean , \[ in the , \+ in those \] places where , uh , like the economy is really bad *T*-1 , they might , you know , be more tempted *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the , you know , money *-3 to put food on the table and stuff like that .

167877:133	\[ But \+ , but , \] uh , I think , I mean 0 even more than that , even , I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able *-1 to read , you know ? Which \[ it \+ MUMBLEx , I mean *T*-2 it \] sounds like , uh , N_S
167894:60	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] mean I just ca n't even picture how that could happen . You know , except maybe to someone who *T*-1 's , you know , really badly learning , uh , disabled or something *T*-2 . E_S

167903:8	well when I went to elementary school *T*-1 \[ it , \+ it \] was n't in a great area E_S
167904:84	but \[ \[ I still , \+ I mean , I learned * to read , \] \+ started *-1 learning *-2 to read \] when I was in kindergarten *T*-3 , you know . E_S
167908:50	So I guess 0 \[ I ca n't really \+ I ca n't \] say what it *EXP*-2 would be like *T*-1 * to , uh , grow up in a really oppressed region . E_S
167929:201	I think 0 it *EXP*-2 'd be interesting * \[ to , \+ you know , to \] spend a couple of days * just looking around an inner city school . Uh , you know , \[ sort , \+ sort \] of maybe from elementary through , uh , high school . You know , just sort of * to get a feel for what it 's like *T*-1 . E_S
167996:42	and it 's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in *T*-1 E_S
168002:29	And , uh , Seattle is on Puget Sound which *T*-1 is a inland waterway between two mountains . E_S
168012:73	Here in Utah up along the Wasatch MUMBLEx along the western side \[ of the , \+ of these \] Rocky Mountains here , where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo *T*-1 E_S and Logan 's up in the valley a little bit further north , E_S we get a lot of pollution E_S
168017:38	And , uh , it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion *T*-1 . E_S And when we \[ get , \+ get \] cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above *T*-2 E_S
168017:63	And , uh , it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion *T*-1 . E_S And when we \[ get , \+ get \] cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above *T*-2 E_S
168021:48	and we 're starting *-2 to hit pollution levels *ICH*-3 now on the Wasatch front which *T*-1 match that of L A a few years ago . E_S
168026:8	Because when I grew up here *T*-1 , it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys E_S
168042:24	well they 've already passed laws where you have *-1 to get your cars checked *-3 for pollution if you 're in certain counties *T*-2 , E_S
168067:47	They 're also talking very seriously about the thing called * a dirt gun . Where they 're , uh , looking at the emissions from the car *-2 using basically a spectrometer and looking at \[ the , \+ \] basically how much of what *T*-1 is coming out of the exhaust *T*-3 . E_S
168067:128	They 're also talking very seriously about the thing called * a dirt gun . Where they 're , uh , looking at the emissions from the car *-2 using basically a spectrometer and looking at \[ the , \+ \] basically how much of what *T*-1 is coming out of the exhaust *T*-3 . E_S
168079:5	what they do *T*-1 , E_S they do several different types of things . E_S
168089:7	Now where does the source light go *T*-1 ? E_S
168113:83	and I can drive to work \[ in , \+ \] uh *ICH*-2 , and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor . Which *T*-1 goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges . E_S
168122:88	\[ So \+ so \] \[ \[ it \+ it 's , \] \+ it *EXP*-3 's \] not hard * to see \[ why , \+ why \] I keep *-1 driving *T*-2 . E_S
168130:22	Basically , \[ what , \+ what \] your personal opinion *ICH*-3 is *T*-2 on it . E_S
168140:40	they started first in Sarasota City . Uh , you know , which *T*-1 makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually . E_S
168157:7	And what they 've done *T*-1 is they 've broken everything down into garbage . Uh , yard trash . Plastic , \[ cr- , \+ cans \] and glass . And then , uh , paper . E_S
168167:4	Which , in the paper , *T*-3 it 's just , uh , newspaper and corrugated cardboard . Is the only thing 0 you 're supposed *-1 to put *T*-2 in there . E_S
168185:7	But when I lived in Orlando *T*-1 , it 's like you could put almost anything in there E_S
168202:4	what is the name of that company *T*-1 . E_S
168217:40	\[ \[ And she , \+ \[ and , \+ and \] what she \] said *T*-2 \[ that , \+ that \] generally , the problems that people have *T*-1 with * being environmentally conscious is number one , they do n't want it to change their lifestyle \[ and , \+ and \] like , you know , especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything . E_S
168221:43	\[ Which \+ \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] \] what recycling at home sorting does *T*-1 , you know . E_S
168229:80	And , uh , it can actually turn out *-1 to be a lot of extra work because \[ what they do *T*-2 , \+ what they do *T*-3 \] here in Sarasota county is 0 they 've got , N_S
168333:6	So where exactly are you *T*-1 in terms \[ of , \+ of , \] like , Sarasota ? E_S
168394:128	Uh , and \[ really , \+ \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ we \] were really \] forced *-2 into *-3 keeping a budget because \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] paid once a month which *T*-1 \[ sort of , \+ sort of \] forces some , uh , uh , restrictions E_S
168402:65	We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem *-1 to have any money problems which I guess 0 *T*-2 is a comfortable thing . E_S
168420:77	Uh , housing prices are , you know , like from four to ten times more expensive than , uh , uh , they were *?* where I came from *T*-1 in , uh , Dallas . E_S
168450:5	When I , uh , was in , uh , undergraduate school a long , long time ago *T*-1 , I , uh , noted that the \[ monthly salary , \+ starting average monthly \[ salary \+ salary \] \] for engineers \[ that , \+ \] you know , in my discipline , was like oh , six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that . E_S
168454:71	And , uh , I noted at that point that \[ I was , \+ you know , if that 's \] what my salary *ICH*-3 was *T*-2 that I drew *T*-1 then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made *?* during his best year ever . E_S
168475:94	\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] kind of a strange topic \[ * \[ to , \+ to try *-3 to , \] \+ for two people who *T*-1 do n't really have a budget to \] talk about budgeting and how they manage their money *T*-2 . E_S

168481:4	How big is your family *T*-2 ? E_S
168518:70	And , uh , he has a teller card so he can , uh , \[ do what he wi- , \+ do what he wishes *T*-2 \] with the money that I put *T*-1 in the bank . E_S
168542:5	When I was younger *T*-1 I thought 0 it was , uh , a sign of a civilized society if you did n't have , uh , capital punishment E_S
168564:81	but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] punish *T*-1 , especially criminals who *T*-2 seem *-3 to have absolutely no remorse for what they 've done *T*-4 . E_S

168569:43	Like in our state right now , there 's a fourteen year old boy who *T*-1 raped and then killed a seven year old girl E_S
168574:4	What 's he going *-1 to be doing *T*-2 when he turns into an adult *T*-3 . E_S
168574:33	What 's he going *-1 to be doing *T*-2 when he turns into an adult *T*-3 . E_S
168613:7	But when I 've got *-1 to work *-2 to pay my dues and your dues *T*-3 then I do n't like you very much anymore . E_S
168621:55	but \[ it 's , \+ but I think 0 it 's \] relatively unimportant compared to what 's the most effective way of , * dealing with crime *T*-1 E_S
168640:15	I guess 0 what *T*-1 worries me about capital punishment is , uh , 0 when I see people enthusiastic about it and , uh , uh , sort of bloodthirsty *T*-2 . I think 0 it brings out the worst \[ in the , \+ in the \] people who *T*-3 do the punishing E_S

168660:52	On the one hand \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I admire the person who *T*-1 has the guts *-2 to do it because \[ I could n't \+ I could n't \] stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing E_S
168668:30	the other thing that *T*-1 bothers me is when it becomes a political issue *T*-2 because \[ I do n't really think 0 it , \+ uh , I do n't really think 0 it 's \] a very important aspect of * fighting crime or law and order or anything else . E_S
168687:14	\[ What \+ what 's *T*-1 \] making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of * punishing ? E_S
168701:72	and , uh , I 've also never been a victim although \[ I have some , \+ I have two \] friends whose wives *T*-1 were murdered *-2 E_S
168723:11	That 's what I 've heard *T*-1 too .
168777:19	and , you know , whenever you 're with your kids *T*-2 , you want *-1 to interact with them rather than just ignore them . E_S
168794:14	and , uh , when our son started *-2 playing violin *T*-1 , I took up violin E_S
168795:7	and when our daughter started *-2 playing cello *T*-1 , I took up cello . E_S
168818:55	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] took great pleasure in * reading to my kids when they were little *T*-1 E_S

168879:16	\[ Ho- , \+ how \] old are your kids *T*-1 again ? E_S

168896:4	What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
168902:182	I \[ was ju- , \+ started \] *-1 to think about all the big , you know , data bases 0 they have *T*-2 with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those , you know , demographics studies that they do *T*-4 that , *T*-5 um , you know , have , who *T*-6 knows , how much , you know , stuff about all the purchases that you 've made *T*-7 and everything *T*-3 kept tract *-8 somewhere E_S

168908:41	I do n't know \[ how much the stuff actually , \+ what they actually have *T*-1 \] in there E_S
168926:49	And , uh , they instituted a \[ drug policy there . \+ Drug testing policy \] where they randomly would test , uh , employees *T*-1 E_S
168933:47	But there were some things *ICH*-3 that people brought *T*-1 up like well what *T*-2 happens if \[ they , \+ they \] get a false positive , you know , what recourse do you have *T*-4 . E_S

168942:7	So what that means *T*-1 is , to me , that really it 's the government that *T*-2 's requiring this , E_S
168948:173	and \[ if they 're , \+ you know , if they 're \] on some kind of , you know , \[ contol- , \+ controlled \] substance then , you know , it kinds of takes away from the job of , you know , the supervisor or manager type person , you know , who *T*-1 is able *-2 to evaluate them . E_S
168951:38	Well , what about this , uh , AIDS epidemic now ? E_S Where you find that , uh , uh , you know , certain people \[ are \+ actually \[ are , \+ are \] \] criminal in their disregard for \[ it- , \+ others *T*-1 . \] E_S
168972:54	Wel- , I guess 0 it kind of borders on \[ where , \+ I mean what \] do you value *T*-1 more . The invasion of , uh , the person 's privacy or the possible danger to , you know , other people . E_S
169004:22	uh , I do n't know how exactly I feel about that *T*-1 . E_S
169025:43	and you have *-1 to do a public service project . Uh , in which leadership is the key element *T*-2 . E_S
169056:16	that probably is not what *T*-1 was comprehended *-2 . E_S
169057:32	There are other things such as civil service uh , which many people , uh , are lifelong employees of *T*-1 E_S
169067:25	but I suspect 0 that was not what they had *T*-1 in mind either . E_S
169081:79	Uh , kind of in lieu of the draft \[ for , \+ for \] people \[ who *T*-2 do n't , \+ uh , who , you know , *T*-1 are \] conscientious objectors or do n't otherwise want \[ \[ e- , \+ e- , \] \+ *-3 to be \] in the military , you know . E_S

169124:63	I mean , \[ you , \+ you \] look at the last \[ mis- , \+ military \] action which *T*-1 was in the Persian Gulf and was n't anywhere near the United States E_S
169128:55	\[ my , \+ my \] point was that \[ there is , \+ for people who *T*-1 do n't want *-2 to do the military service , \[ there , \+ it would be neat if there \] were \] an alternative that *T*-4 could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and , uh , sense of community that the Boy Scouts , N_S
169130:14	So , um , how do you feel about the crime in your city *T*-1 ? E_S
169144:24	But , actually , you know , when you look \[ at , \+ at \] Minneapolis as compared to where I used *-1 to live *T*-2 *T*-3 , it 's really quite a bit better . Uh , because I came from Florida E_S
169144:66	But , actually , you know , when you look \[ at , \+ at \] Minneapolis as compared to where I used *-1 to live *T*-2 *T*-3 , it 's really quite a bit better . Uh , because I came from Florida E_S
169153:5	What part of California are you from *T*-1 ? E_S
169184:19	That 's really a shame when it has *-1 to constrain your activities like *T*-2 , N_S
169187:71	We have a neighborhood watch program in \[ the house , \+ uh , the development \] that we live in *T*-2 , which I think 0 *T*-1 is a great way 0 * to reduce , uh , home theft , burglary , and things of that sort *T*-3 . E_S
169191:16	Do you have that where you live *T*-1 E_S
169210:24	it 's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work *T*-1 , you know , E_S
169237:14	They know exactly what they 're going for *T*-1 . E_S
169256:56	unfortunately it 's starting *-1 to really , you know , look at people 's habits and where they are *T*-2 at particular points of the day . E_S
169263:44	Like one of the guys 0 I work with *T*-1 really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis *T*-2 because he 's from Detroit E_S
169287:10	is that what \[ you , \+ you \] did *T*-1 in your program ? Where you have a list of license plates *T*-2 ? E_S
169287:49	is that what \[ you , \+ you \] did *T*-1 in your program ? Where you have a list of license plates *T*-2 ? E_S
169299:16	I 'm not sure where we went *T*-1 from there , E_S
169309:67	\[ that , \+ that \] whole thing of * being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings , noticing people who *T*-1 look suspicious uh , activities like that ,
169324:23	uh , you can do that which *T*-3 is what I choose *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
169324:34	uh , you can do that which *T*-3 is what I choose *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
169337:5	when I was getting robbed *-1 down in Florida *T*-2 , I was really considering *-3 electrifying doors um , things like that like E_S
169355:50	\[ There was a , \+ there was a \] case about two years ago where a guy knew 0 he was going *-1 to get robbed *-2 *T*-3 E_S
169359:10	and essentially what he had done *T*-1 is * set \[ \[ a , \+ a \] elec- , \+ a electrocution \] trap for the burglar in his own home . E_S
169409:4	what am I trying *-1 to say *T*-2 . Uh , N_S
169425:40	and anything 0 I participated in *T*-1 or know about *T*-1 when I read about it in the paper *T*-2 is always \[ so , \+ \] uh , covered *-3 from such a funny and superficial perspective that I do n't have much confidence in it . E_S
169429:75	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] like *-1 to refer to this as sort of CONSUMER REPORT phenomenon .

169441:75	And the view that I would rather take *T*-1 is that there 's a different amount of information 0 you need *T*-2 when you 're particularly interested in a topic or , uh , particularly interested in *-7 buying something \[ as a , \+ you know as a \] hobbyist *T*-5 versus when you want *-3 to go out and buy a blender because you need *-4 to mix things *T*-6 .

169452:40	If you want *-1 to just have an idea as to what *T*-2 's going on , most papers , \[ a- , \+ and \] especially the better papers , \[ the , \+ the \] TIMES , the WALL STREET JOURNAL , the WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea . E_S
169459:45	If you were deeply involved in it , then you immediately realize that what they print *T*-1 is stuff that you probably knew *T*-5 already and the stuff that you want *T*-2 they 're not printing *T*-4 because the average person does n't need or want *-3 to know that much . E_S
169478:13	By the way when you say 0 most people think 0 it is *?* *T*-1 , E_S I think 0 it 's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine *ICH*-2 think 0 it is *?* , percent . E_S
169484:24	I know a lot of people who *T*-1 may watch the T V news in the evening but do n't spend the time *-2 to actually read a newspaper . E_S
169493:30	and for awhile I did n't read a newspaper when I came out here *T*-2 because I did n't find one that I liked *T*-1 . E_S
169519:7	and when I arrived at her house *T*-1 , she was engrossed in that . E_S
169521:46	And I thought 0 that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what *T*-1 was going on . E_S
169530:79	I had , I guess , five years ago now , wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings . And afterwards , decided that what I had gotten *T*-1 out of it just was n't worth the time 0 I put *T*-2 in . And that these things are just very slow in * seeing information come out . E_S
169557:38	Uh , so , uh , \[ how do you , \+ how do you \] feel *T*-1 ? E_S
169571:31	Uh , at least , my understanding of the law which *T*-1 is n't very good . E_S
169578:73	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that 's probably all right in that they , you know , maybe know what \[ the , \+ the \] norm *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 for a particular thing . E_S
169583:21	And , I guess , also what the system will absorb *T*-1 . E_S
169628:25	You know , it 's someone who *T*-1 had , uh , killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact . E_S
169668:32	But I guess 0 there have been several cases where people have been executed *-1 by mistake *T*-2 E_S
169677:77	The other thing 0 they asked about *T*-1 was whether uh , uh , the verdict should be required *-2 to be unanimous . Which , again , I think 0 *T*-3 is the way 0 it is *T*-5 now . That \[ all the , \+ all \] verdicts , N_S
169736:70	\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] been so long 0 I 've \[ prac- , \+ practically \] forgot who Noriega was *T*-1 , you know . E_S
169788:28	Uh , I do n't know of anyone who *T*-1 ever has been picked *-2 out and been tested *-2 . E_S
169805:6	So what do you think *T*-1 about that ? E_S
169825:7	But what it was *T*-1 , was 0 \[ she had been u- , \+ she had been , \] uh , in the jungle E_S
169844:26	\[ How , \+ do you know how \] wrong they are *T*-1 ? E_S
169865:96	and if they would just say oh , this person 's drug test is positive we wo n't hire them you know . Then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything *T*-1 . E_S
169893:18	I 'm not real sure how I feel *T*-1 about it because I can see it from two ways . E_S

170027:104	I was thinking also that \[ there 'd be , \+ there could be \] a fair burn out factor um , in * just having *-2 to respond to people 's needs where the needs are sometimes , depending on the person , not going *-3 to be what we would perceive of *T*-1 as rational need *T*-4 . E_S

170036:24	and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were *T*-1 E_S

170061:37	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 part of what you 're saying *T*-1 matches what I \[ h- , \+ have \] read *T*-2 . E_S

170062:36	I used *-1 to initially think that the only people who *T*-2 went into such residences were people who , uh , *T*-3 were adequately deficient in their abilities , uh physical or mental , that they could n't take care of themselves . E_S

170066:28	But I also know a couple of people whose parents *T*-1 have gone into such things because I think they provide , um , a lot of social activities . E_S
170072:25	and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation *T*-1 . E_S
170091:4	How are you *T*-1 ? E_S

170143:7	and when the envelope was empty *T*-1 , then you did n't have any more money 0 * to spend *T*-2 in that area . E_S
170147:56	And that worked out real well cause we did n't have *-1 to keep *-2 writing down what we 'd spent *T*-3 . E_S
170151:18	It was just that when that was empty *T*-1 , you knew 0 you were out of money . E_S
170174:7	but when you 're only earning half the salary *T*-1 . Even though I was n't spending much money , \[ I sometimes \+ I sometimes \] would just , N_S
170176:15	Uh , and sometimes what I would do *T*-1 is * keep a piece of paper in my wallet E_S
170177:122	and every time 0 \[ I , \+ uh , I \] spent money , I mean cash mostly *T*-1 , I would , uh , write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent *T*-2 on food so I could do better planning . E_S

170320:29	\[ What are your , \+ uh , what sorts of things \] would you consider *T*-1 important ? E_S

170913:22	you ca n't always get in when you want *-1 too *?* *T*-2 E_S
170917:6	When you need it *T*-1 , you need it I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
170922:29	And the money *ICH*-3 is also another issue . How you 're going *-1 to pay for it *T*-2 . E_S
170944:54	And , with medicine being the way 0 it is *T*-1 , you 're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down *T*-2 E_S
170948:58	Well maybe that 's the purpose of the nursing home is * to have them go someplace where they can see that it 's not worth * continuing *T*-1 . E_S
170969:74	but , uh , I guess 0 I would say 0 it *EXP*-1 's not easy * to find \[ wha- , \+ what \] most parents would want *T*-2 . E_S

171135:4	What do you think *T*-1 ? . E_S
171137:34	Well , uh , I ca n't be terribly authoritative on what life was like *T*-1 thirty years ago , uh , because I 'm not that old yet . E_S

171230:19	I mean our kids , where would they be *T*-1 without Nintendo and , you know , their T V shows N_S
171239:24	You know , I 'm wondering what this is going *-1 to do *T*-2 in ten and twenty years . E_S
171242:67	and there 's the fact that , you know , nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding *-1 to have kids which *T*-2 generally tends *-3 to happen . E_S
171262:4	When is this good or not good *T*-1 . E_S
171279:43	and I do n't think that America is currently the type of environment where * struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered *-1 to be good *T*-2 . E_S

E_S
171312:7	And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence *T*-1 is beyond me . E_S
171319:55	You know , \[ I , \+ I \] attended a trial in , uh , Germany when I was a student *T*-1 E_S

171616:79	Uh , and I only update that , oh I do n't know , maybe once every quarter or so . Every three months . Just , basically when the statements come in *T*-1 .

171717:16	I do n't know what a shoe company 's doing *T*-1 *-2 running a computer company . E_S
171763:27	And , it 's like , okay , what *ICH*-1 do we have *T*-3 left , what do we have *-2 to pay *T*-4 , what have we paid *T*-5 this month . What *T*-6 has n't come in yet , you know . E_S
171763:51	And , it 's like , okay , what *ICH*-1 do we have *T*-3 left , what do we have *-2 to pay *T*-4 , what have we paid *T*-5 this month . What *T*-6 has n't come in yet , you know . E_S

171806:53	Well it *EXP*-2 will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what *T*-1 happens now 0 you , N_S
171821:20	Well , it depends on where *ICH*-2 you 're from *T*-1 in Texas . E_S
171830:11	That 's how it is *T*-1 . E_S
171946:23	but , uh , now they have what *T*-1 's called *-2 the World Football League E_S
171969:21	So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff *T*-2 . E_S
171973:31	and \[ I , \+ I \] can see what you 're saying *T*-1 about the male bonding E_S
172001:25	Well see , now see that 's what you got *-1 to do *T*-2 , see . E_S
172074:32	maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who *T*-1 come back again and again . E_S
172098:39	Uh , one thing 0 I heard *T*-1 was this , where \[ they have , \+ instead of *-2 going to the regular court , they have \] \[ a , \+ a \] mock court *T*-3 . E_S
172116:29	there would be some types of crimes for which you 're not guaranteed *-1 a jury trial *T*-2 ? E_S
172123:35	\[ th- , \+ there 's \] a point on which we do n't agree *T*-1 . E_S
172135:40	So I 'm not out for * streamlining things to the point where we , uh , take that , you know , N_S
172153:22	But I meant for some , when both parties agreed that yes , we 're going *-1 to have a judge here *T*-2 . E_S
172207:26	and I think 0 that may be where jury use is overdone *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
172210:23	I mean there are cases where they could be settled *-1 , maybe out of court a little more efficiently *T*-2 . E_S
172245:23	well I was called *-1 once when I was nineteen *T*-2 E_S
172310:84	so \[ I , \+ I 've \] had an I B M clone *ICH*-2 , I guess 0 *T*-3 , for a couple of years now , which I 've been trying , continually upgrading *T*-1 I guess . E_S
172323:4	Where you going to school *T*-1 ? E_S
172344:30	I have some games *ICH*-2 , of course , which I play *T*-1 on there E_S
172345:31	and , uh , uh , I have a program which *T*-1 allows me to access a , uh , weather data bank E_S
172346:49	so I can , like , check up on the weather around the country or whatever which *T*-1 is a hobby . E_S
172379:93	so I can log into \[ the sys- , \+ the , uh , network \] at Georgia Tech and access my account through there , \[ which is , \+ which \] *T*-2 can be useful . E_S
172389:125	actually I do n't think 0 I 've ever used a typewriter \[ in , \+ in \] my life *-1 \[ to do \[ a , \+ a \] \+ to do a \] report . Because my family , when I was growing up *T*-2 , we got a basic computer . T R S Eighty when they first came out *T*-3 . E_S

172414:19	I just ca n't imagine how people did it before *T*-1 . E_S
172433:22	Uh , \[ I , \+ when I \] come home from work *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] like *-2 to stay far away from computers and electronic things . E_S

172478:18	* Tell you 0 what we can do *T*-1 is , uh , 0 I can punch the , uh , one , E_S

172496:73	Uh , I just finished *-1 fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted *-2 from the federal form *T*-3 E_S
172530:37	But I guess 0 \[ when I hear , \+ when I see \] the comparison between the United States and , uh , any other western country *T*-1 , uh , \[ their , \+ their \] rates are like , uh , forty-one , forty-two and ours are like thirty-six , thirty-seven , you know , E_S
172534:89	Well and I still think that , * having lived in Europe for awhile , you know , difference in living conditions are certainly well worth , uh , what we pay *T*-1 for it . E_S
172540:45	\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] not sure 0 I understand what you mean *T*-1 . E_S

173390:24	you would like *-1 to know what they 're doing *T*-2 right . E_S
173411:17	but uh , not to where she feels different *T*-1 , E_S
173417:34	It *EXP*-2 's hard * to explain to them why you ca n't *?* *T*-1 . E_S

173450:4	How are they coping with it *T*-1 ? E_S
173500:25	I think 0 we should do what Europe does *T*-1 and include cultural activities in our school system . E_S

173702:79	\[ it 's , \+ it *ICH*-5 's \] hard \[ * to , \+ I guess , for me to \] justify what *T*-1 \[ so- , \+ seems \] like , you know , basically a breach of the \[ First Amen- , \+ you know , freedom from , uh , search and seizure , \] you know , uh , on something that *T*-2 may *RNR*-3 or may not stand as a law , you know , fifty years *ICH*-4 from now or even twenty or ten , E_S
173703:4	who *T*-1 knows . E_S
173741:14	well that 's why there 's , you know , people dealing it because there 's money in it *T*-1 , you know . E_S
173775:43	It goes back to , you know , \[ what right , \+ what can society impose *T*-1 \] on people . E_S

173801:4	What is it *T*-1 that you are , you know , particularly upset about *T*-2 ? E_S
173804:38	and , uh , I 'm not sure 0 they know exactly what , uh , uh , public education supposed *-1 to be for *T*-2 anymore . E_S
173812:5	What *ICH*-2 do you feel that your kids are getting *T*-1 in the parochial schools that they would n't get *T*-3 in \[ a , \+ the \] public school system ? E_S
173818:86	\[ Which , \+ \] uh , I mean if you 're , uh , sending two thousand dollars that way every year , you , uh , watch what *T*-1 goes on
173822:26	So you 're saying that the taxpayer who *T*-1 also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of , uh , real estate or other taxes E_S
173833:65	And , I guess 0 my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California , for example , where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school *T*-1 E_S
173835:60	Uh , people are , uh , reluctant *-1 to pass , uh , school tax levies even , uh , when the money is needed *-3 or would be well spent *T*-2 because \[ it 's , \+ \] uh , they do n't have kids in the schools . E_S
173858:69	You know , \[ I , \+ I \] believe that the original idea of public education in the United States , which I guess 0 *T*-1 was controversial at the time of the constitution . E_S Uh , you know , it barely made it . E_S
173871:19	Well , that 's exactly what I was going *-1 to say *T*-2 . E_S
173882:11	That 's what I used *-1 to think 0 education was all about *T*-2 when I was a college professor *T*-3 E_S
173882:50	That 's what I used *-1 to think 0 education was all about *T*-2 when I was a college professor *T*-3 E_S
173885:49	And , uh , I 'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is *T*-1 . E_S
173889:20	And , uh , that 's why I guess I 'm sort of , reluctantly , uh , in favor of these , uh , choice programs *T*-1 . E_S
173894:73	and the sense that I get *T*-1 from public school teachers that I know *T*-2 is that they are very conscious of what they feel 0 they should be doing *T*-3 E_S
173896:57	But they find that they are also being asked *-1 to do a bunch of other stuff which they think 0 *T*-2 is only tangentially related E_S
173933:10	Well , when mine were growing up *T*-1 , I did some traveling \[ and \+ but \] not that extensively E_S
173944:4	What was the age difference *ICH*-2 *T*-1 between the youngest and the oldest ? E_S
173956:20	We look back and wonder how we did it *T*-1 . E_S
174018:14	things like that where they 're not really missing the presence , you know *T*-1 . E_S
174074:6	And what would you do *T*-1 , E_S
174089:19	So they would just pick whatever issue *T*-1 kind of was at a head that week E_S
174112:35	See I was raised *-1 in that type of family where , you know , you do n't disobey me , you mind me *T*-2 E_S
174113:27	but if you have a problem with what we did *T*-1 or how we did it *T*-2 , you can always come back and talk to me about it . E_S
174113:43	but if you have a problem with what we did *T*-1 or how we did it *T*-2 , you can always come back and talk to me about it . E_S
174125:6	so why * make fun of mine *T*-1 ? E_S
174146:5	Whatever *T*-1 was voted on *-2 , huh . E_S
174165:37	I can remember times 0 my parents would say well what do you think 0 *T*-1 would be a fair punishment *T*-2 . E_S
174169:47	And we would always come up with something that *T*-1 was harder than what they would have done *T*-2 you know . E_S
174178:9	Oh , why is that *T*-1 ? E_S
174186:4	How you doing *T*-1 ? E_S
174191:42	Uh , I guess 0 the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that *T*-2 or how we would change it *T*-1 . E_S
174191:64	Uh , I guess 0 the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that *T*-2 or how we would change it *T*-1 . E_S
174195:19	Uh , I 'm ready whenever you are *?* *T*-1 . E_S
174199:33	So , uh , \[ what are your , \+ what are your \] thoughts on the subject *T*-1 there ? E_S
174242:47	\[ I , \+ I \] know of a couple of people at least who *T*-1 would be arguing with that . Or arguing against that pretty vehemently . E_S
174253:78	but I mean even now \[ we 've got , \+ I know 0 we 've got \] plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted *-1 and things like that *T*-2 E_S
174254:13	and that 's what the trial by jury . N_S
174259:54	\[ if , \+ if \] the judge was doing it himself , without any checks and balances who *T*-1 's *-2 to say . E_S
174272:72	But \[ I \+ . I \] tend *-1 to follow it *-3 \[ just to , \+ just to \] know what *T*-2 's going on . E_S
174294:56	I know a little more about civil cases \[ when , \+ than \] criminal cases . Which *T*-1 is , N_S
174298:18	it 's more in how you present it *T*-1 versus , you know , who *T*-2 's right . E_S
174298:50	it 's more in how you present it *T*-1 versus , you know , who *T*-2 's right . E_S
174301:93	Because a lot of those things , \[ \[ it 's all , \+ it 's in , \] \+ it 's \] largely a matter of viewpoint . And who *T*-1 can argue their case better . E_S
174309:58	\[ you \+ I \] always think about *-1 watching the PEOPLE 'S COURT or something . And how weird those cases get *T*-2 . E_S
174317:4	When I was , a couple of years ago , involved in some pretrial stuff *T*-1 and N_S
174336:32	And then you get people \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 bring in cases just because they want *-2 to bring them up just because . E_S
174375:42	\[ I wonder , \+ I wonder \] \[ how , \+ how \] the civil system or the court system must differ between there and * say *RNR*-3 where I am *T*-1 in Minneapolis *T*-2 .
174375:94	\[ I wonder , \+ I wonder \] \[ how , \+ how \] the civil system or the court system must differ between there and * say *RNR*-3 where I am *T*-1 in Minneapolis *T*-2 .
174380:8	From what I understand *T*-1 , it 's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana *T*-2 . E_S
174380:43	From what I understand *T*-1 , it 's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana *T*-2 . E_S
174401:16	So we 'll see what *T*-1 happens . E_S
174405:19	I 'm not really sure how we could change the legal system *-1 to make it better *T*-2 .
174437:18	I 'm not real sure what the , N_S
174466:4	What do you do now *T*-1 ? E_S
174482:41	I used *-1 to think \[ when I was , \+ when I was \] younger *T*-2 that , uh , by this time we 'd have lots more \[ in \+ \] stuff in space than we do now . E_S
174491:16	I do n't know what you think *T*-1 about all that . E_S
174524:23	It 's just a matter of how big you build it *-2 *T*-1 . E_S
174529:28	So the side effects of * doing that which I think 0 *T*-1 would be good , you know , very , very good \[ for al- , \+ for everyone \] in the long run \[ is , \+ uh , is \] \[ it , \+ 0 some \] of the other things 0 I 'd like *-2 to see *T*-3 happen would happen also , E_S
174561:95	the only commitments that they 're interested in *-1 making *T*-2 or even talking about *T*-2 are ones for flash value like , uh , the trip to Mars . Which *T*-3 \[ \[ is , \+ would , \] \+ would \] produce some useful scientific research and so forth , E_S
174582:27	And , uh , unfortunately , that 's not what I thinks 0 *T*-1 happened . E_S
174603:11	That 's what *T*-1 happened with Apollo . E_S
174614:4	What do you think *T*-1 about capital punishment ? E_S
174619:4	Which crimes do you feel that *T*-1 ? N_S
174685:11	That 's what *T*-1 's happening here . E_S
174705:77	I wish 0 if they were going *-1 to do it , they would be a little more consistent in *-3 dealing with who *T*-2 gets lethal injection and who *T*-4 does n't . E_S
174705:95	I wish 0 if they were going *-1 to do it , they would be a little more consistent in *-3 dealing with who *T*-2 gets lethal injection and who *T*-4 does n't . E_S
174717:15	up in Minnesota where I am *T*-1 now , they do n't have the death penalty . E_S
174752:4	What do you do *T*-1 Georgeanne ? E_S
174758:4	What program you in *T*-1 ? E_S
174767:4	What do you do *T*-1 ? E_S
174827:17	you have these people who *T*-1 are serial killers that *T*-2 did n't even get the death sentence back when ever you know . E_S
174836:27	\[ what *T*-1 is it , \+ what *T*-2 's \] the policy *ICH*-3 now with treason ? E_S
174853:7	So how do you feel *T*-1 about it ? E_S
174870:4	Where do you work *T*-1 ? E_S
174908:48	Like if you 're on a prescription drug of some kind , you know , what are they going *-1 to do *T*-2 about that . E_S
174912:40	You know , I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested *-1 for Honeywell *T*-2 E_S
174922:16	\[ What , \+ what \] program are you in *T*-1 over at Carnegie Mellon ? E_S
174949:33	So , uh , it was one of those things where you go through \[ the , \+ the \] general battery of all their tests *T*-1 E_S
174968:16	\[ Wh- , \+ what \] *T*-1 happens if you were *-2 to fail ? E_S
174973:15	I believe from what *ICH*-2 I remember *T*-1 of the literature 0 they gave , uh , if you fail I believe they give you one more chance . E_S
174979:28	so there 's undoubtedly a proportion of people who *T*-1 do fail , you know . E_S
175007:22	So , one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process *T*-1 . E_S
175026:48	and while I do n't do any drugs myself , I 've seen some people who *T*-1 work there , uh , you know , smoking a joint or whatever . E_S
175042:4	How do you feel about public schools *T*-1 ? E_S
175048:21	Uh , I 'm not sure where *ICH*-2 Georgia ranks *T*-1 in the nation E_S
175067:17	I have a sister who *T*-1 used *-2 to live in Kennesaw , Georgia . E_S
175071:56	And , uh , she has a young boy . Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there *T*-1 . E_S
175133:4	What do you think 0 *T*-1 's wrong * to cause that ? E_S
175156:7	And when you have two kids in that class that *T*-2 constantly keeps \[ ca- , \+ the class \] in an uproar and you 're not at liberty *-1 to do something about it , other than * give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal 's office *T*-3 . \[ \[ \[ It \+ it , \] \+ you know , it can , \] \+ it can \] really be bad . E_S
175204:69	\[ Teachers , \+ you have *-1 to admit that teachers \] have *-2 to slow things down for people who *T*-3 do n't understand , especially if there 's not a very well developed special education program at the school . E_S
175269:95	Uh , one of the things 0 they talked about *T*-1 was , uh , \[ \[ \[ did we , \+ d- , \] \+ wh- , \] \+ what do we \] think *T*-2 about a judge making the decision ? E_S
175279:26	\[ Yo- , \+ you \] know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
175296:13	and that 's why jury selection is often very difficult *T*-1 . Uh . E_S
175299:31	they were saying , uh , you know , what new ways \[ could y- , \+ could it , \] \[ you , \+ you \] know , change the system *T*-1 . E_S
175326:23	I think 0 the only people who *T*-1 benefit from that are the lawyers . E_S
175346:14	That 's MUMBLEx what I 'm saying *T*-1 . E_S
175348:29	I mean , you know , people who *T*-1 commit , uh , crimes that they , N_S
175349:16	I do n't know how it works exactly *T*-1 E_S
175362:26	\[ Yo- , \+ you \] know what I 'm saying *T*-1 ? E_S
175381:4	When you 're saying as far as the appeal , uh , procedure was concerned *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
175410:9	Uh , what would you do *T*-1 *-2 to change it ? To make it better ? E_S
175454:78	In other words you 're saying that , \[ w- , \+ you \] have *-1 to find out whether it 's premeditated or what the circumstances were *T*-3 . E_S
175472:22	See , \[ wh- , \+ when \] you 're with a big company or a big organization *T*-1 , a lot of times , uh , you know , the benefits are good E_S
175474:50	but , uh , you know , sometimes you do n't get tuned *-2 in to what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
175475:169	And \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ uh , that \] anybody could get *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] * dealing with a large company is * to be in a situation where \[ you , \+ you \] get *-4 to know what *T*-2 's going on *T*-3 .

E_S
175477:20	\[ What 's , \+ what 's \] your feeling about benefits *T*-1 ? E_S
175478:5	What sort of benefits would you like *-1 to get *T*-2 from a big company . E_S
175480:112	Well , since I 'm kind of on \[ the , \+ the \] older side , you know , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] just feel like , uh , when I start *-1 talking about benefits *T*-2 , \[ I talk about , \+ I 'm concerned about \] medical benefits . E_S
175496:36	We 're changing * doing other kinds of things . Which *T*-1 to me \[ is , \+ is \] disturbing . E_S
175500:47	But \[ I , \+ I \] do kind of like *-1 to know what *T*-2 's going on and what *T*-3 's happening E_S

175533:58	and \[ every , \+ all \] the other employees are going *-1 to come around and see what sort of things we do *T*-2 . Which I thought 0 *T*-3 was kind of interesting \[ \[ and , \+ But , \] \+ uh , but \] \[ that , \+ that \] \[ sort , \+ sort \] of thing . N_S

175548:54	In the private sector I would think that one of the major , uh , situations , especially when you reach , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] mid-fifties *T*-1 , \[ wa- , \+ is \] * keeping a job until you retire . E_S
175577:55	He needs *-1 to do his own course of investigation \[ and , \+ and \] see what he can do *T*-5 because who *T*-2 knows what *T*-3 's going *-4 to happen in another thirty years . E_S

175599:77	Uh , \[ \[ u- , th- , \+ uh , th- , \] \+ the \] only thing that *T*-1 annoys me is when , uh , people call and \[ they , \+ uh , you \] have solicitation calls *T*-2 . E_S

175640:46	\[ They even call , \+ the newspapers here even call \] people who *T*-1 already subscribe . E_S

175687:15	Uh , and apparently what *T*-1 had happened is 0 someone used her social security number . E_S
175691:99	Uh , \[ and , \+ and \] \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] heard recently \[ that , \+ uh , uh , that \] this is a common occurrence where people are using s- , you know , N_S
175701:53	Uh , if the purchase was made *-1 mail order , they should have a record of where it was shipped *-2 to *T*-3 E_S
175706:78	Uh , if it was some you know , * coming into the store and stuff , then \[ she would ha- , \+ whoever *T*-1 made the purchase would have \] had *-2 find some kind of , uh , you know , document E_S
175727:4	What *T*-1 happened , uh , N_S
175734:97	On the other hand , uh , the more 0 I learn *T*-2 about the history , the more I see 0 it was incremental , uh , decisions . Any one of which *T*-1 was sort of understandable at the time *T*-3 . E_S
175741:105	Well , \[ \[ I 'm , \+ uh , I , \] \+ I \] was just , uh , in high school I guess 0 *T*-2 \[ when it , \+ when it \] ended *T*-1 . E_S
175754:23	I 've never really totally understood what our purpose *ICH*-2 was *T*-1 over there . E_S
175755:40	Just because , you know , we did n't really do anything when we went over *T*-1 it seems like *T*-2 . N_S
175763:21	I guess 0 that 's how they tend *-1 to talk about it *T*-2 .
175785:49	And I was thinking in the course of * talking to him about it , how , uh , in World War Two , the personalties of Stalin , Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war *T*-1 E_S
175786:10	and actually when you think back on the big events of the war *T*-1 , \[ it was , \+ uh , it was \] almost a personal struggle among these three ,
175804:35	And I have a feeling that that 's part of what *T*-1 was involved in the Vietnamese war . E_S
175805:27	They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line , beat them and they would n't come forward *T*-1 . E_S
175815:109	and as you say , uh , * going halfway was probably worse than , uh , * \[ committing , \+ uh , committing \] to a completely and , uh , winning it , whatever that would mean *T*-1 . E_S
175828:30	\[ You knew , \+ you knew \] who *T*-1 was good . E_S
175829:11	You knew who *T*-1 was bad . E_S
175833:118	And \[ it was a , \+ it was a \] \[ traditional m- , \+ \[ the \+ \] traditional battle \] of , kind of good versus evil , \[ if you , \+ \] you know whichever way it is *T*-1 . E_S
175838:81	\[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ the \] sides and the lines that *T*-1 were drawn *-2 are all confused as to who *T*-3 's good and who *T*-4 's bad E_S

175852:67	that pendulum started *-1 to swing , uh , \[ ma- , \+ maybe \] even too far . To the point where , uh , uh , * supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on *T*-2 . E_S
175874:13	So that 's why I concentrate on weekly magazines *T*-1 . E_S
175883:125	\[ And , \+ and so \] \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] like the weekly magazines , uh , because \[ i- , \+ it \] gives me , you know , the high points of what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
175902:22	Well , \[ when , \+ when \] the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway *T*-1 , I 'm saying to myself , hey guys , I 'm inside the beltway . E_S
175917:45	Probably pretty high up on the list is *T*-1 National Public Radio . Uh , which I like *T*-2 . E_S
175925:36	and I always like the letters that they read *T*-1 which *T*-2 tend *-3 to accuse them of *-4 being too liberal and too conservative . E_S
175926:109	And while there 's an inherent , uh , filtering process going on just by the letters 0 they choose *-1 to read *T*-2 , uh , I always figure 0 it 's a good thing when any given group is being accused *-4 by each side of , uh , * favoring the other side *T*-5 . E_S
175930:34	and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections \[ of the , \+ uh , \[ various , \+ \] uh , of the \] articles and the front section *T*-1 E_S
175947:14	I know exactly where that is *T*-1 . E_S
175952:32	\[ we , \+ we \] get the MERCURY which I generally think 0 *T*-1 is actually a pretty good newspaper . E_S
175958:20	well the LOS ANGELES TIMES . Which I 've found *T*-3 to be \[ a , \+ uh a \] very good quality , uh , newspaper E_S
176017:4	Which *T*-1 could be another MUMBLEx of Monty Python . E_S
176023:11	this is how I discovered , you know , \[ the que- , \+ the Prime Minister 's , you know , question \] and answer period *T*-1 , you know . E_S
176027:48	and , uh , \[ a , \+ aside \] from the level of wit which *T*-1 is much higher than , generally , in American politics , uh , which I really enjoy *T*-2 . I really like the fact that they have a chance *-3 to ask hard , real questions I think 0 *T*-4 . E_S

176028:64	And it 's unlike the fairly controlled , uh , press conferences that Presidents of the United States have *T*-1 here where \[ they , \+ they \] always seem , N_S
176034:8	actually what *T*-1 happens \[ is , \+ uh , is , \] 0 my check gets automatically deposited *-2 . E_S
176045:21	Uh , \[ what , \+ what 's \] your budget situation *T*-1 ? E_S
176059:17	But at any rate , what *T*-1 happened was that \[ I , \+ I \] just absolutely put away all the credit cards . E_S
176069:32	But , uh , mostly we just spent cash . Whatever we had *T*-1 . E_S
176074:16	I 'm not sure how old you are *T*-1 . E_S
176096:19	And my intent was that whenever something *ICH*-4 went on sale that I really had *-3 to have *T*-2 *T*-1 , I would have the cash * to buy it right then and there . And not ever have *-5 to spend any money on interest . E_S
176112:63	\[ And , \+ and \] we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge . Along with my trip to Japan which *T*-1 \[ was , \+ was \] fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars E_S
176136:72	But it 's the fact that I have enough \[ of a , \+ of a \] cushion in the bank so that when they come *T*-1 , I can pay them in full . E_S
176164:16	\[ Why , \+ why \] we need *-1 to replace it ? E_S
176169:4	why * not replace it *T*-1 . E_S
176186:27	we sort of take care of the kids when they were school *T*-1
176191:5	When we \[ went , \+ want \] *-2 to go out *-3 to eat *T*-1 , we go out *-4 to eat . E_S
176197:5	When my two year old was in New Orleans *T*-2 , she got bit *-1 on the cheek E_S
176208:33	and \[ \[ w- , \+ why , \] \+ why \] would they be interested \[ in , \+ in \] your little turnip unless , you know , one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well 0 that 's somebody 0 * to molest *T*-1 , you know *T*-2 . E_S
176223:53	I personally feel , uh , 0 in our particular situation , I 'm a much better mother when I work out of the home *T*-1 E_S
176232:16	and that is sometimes what some women who *T*-1 have *-2 to work ,
176234:5	When our children were very young *T*-2 , we had \[ a pay , \+ a live in paid \] baby-sitter that *T*-1 was wonderful . E_S
176277:126	I think 0 it 's real important that you have a place that , first of all parents have a lot of input into *T*-1 and that they 're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day *T*-2 and that at any time you can drop in . E_S
176284:33	and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work *T*-1 . E_S
176285:67	And so , many times , at lunchtime , I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing *T*-1 . E_S
176321:5	what you were alluding to *T*-1 earlier is , you know , women who *T*-2 work for minimal wage \[ \[ an- , \+ and , \] \+ and \] really \[ have t- , \+ feel 0 they have *-3 to \] put their children , N_S

176364:42	Well , you know , but you made the comment *ICH*-1 earlier , why would someone be interested in children *T*-2 . E_S
176387:4	How old are your children *T*-2 ? E_S
176424:7	and what she does *T*-1 is she , teaches at a preschool . E_S
176495:4	What did you do *T*-1 when your kids were growing up *T*-2 ? E_S
176495:20	What did you do *T*-1 when your kids were growing up *T*-2 ? E_S
176514:33	But I quit my job because I could n't stand how she was taking care of my child *T*-1 . E_S
176519:7	So when my son stayed over there *T*-1 , he got sick . E_S
176534:11	That 's what he got *T*-1 , you know . E_S
176537:10	But then what *T*-1 happened \[ was , \+ is , \] I said , uh , he just threw up E_S
176553:10	And then what *T*-1 happened \[ was , \+ is , \] you know , 0 they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter . E_S
176563:28	Now \[ why did n't he , \+ why did n't she \] keep him home with her *T*-1 ? E_S
176566:24	So , it got to the point where \[ he 's , \+ he 's \] supposed *-1 to get out of , uh , kindergarten like about two thirty *T*-2 . E_S
176582:53	Then I went and got \[ a , \+ uh , a \] job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better *T*-1 . E_S
176592:17	\[ When , \+ when \] our kids were small *T*-1 we had a couple of , uh , \[ good , \+ good \] women who , uh , *T*-2 would often \[ c- , \+ uh , get them to come \] to the house . E_S

176612:27	My feeling is that certain jobs that when there 's immediate threat to life and limb , uh , if should somebody be under the influence of drugs *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I 'd \] be willing *-2 to support that . E_S
176617:66	Because \[ it , \+ you know , uh , like , there \] was an incident *ICH*-1 several years ago where an Amtrak engineer MUMBLEx you know N_S
176623:10	But \[ where it 's not necessary *T*-1 , \+ uh , in that regard , where it 's not an immediate threat \] to life and limb or property *T*-2 uh , \[ \[ I , \+ I 'd , \] \+ I \] would seriously question it . E_S

176634:30	\[ it , \+ to me , no matter how much \[ \[ the , \+ th- , \] \+ our \] company claims 0 it 's \] not a constitutional issue . That , because this is , uh , between a company and an employee \[ it is not , \+ it is not \] a government *T*-1 , E_S
176700:74	And then there 's \[ a , \+ a \] much more , uh , uh , refined test , uh , uh , spectrography or whatever it 's called *-2 *T*-1 . The \[ chemo- , \+ chemotography \] uh , 0 *T*-3 to determine exactly \[ what the , \+ what the \] things are *T*-4 . E_S

176780:43	So , we \[ left it , \+ left it \] to somebody who *T*-1 does it for a living . E_S
176797:16	So it 's just what I have *-1 to do *T*-2 *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 , more or less , around the house , you know , for my parents E_S
176811:47	\[ A- , \+ and \] \[ you knew how , \+ you knew how \] * to do the framing *T*-1 ? E_S
176813:21	Uh , well my dad knew how * to do most of it *T*-1 , you know . E_S
176862:48	Well , the last thing 0 I did *T*-1 completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of *T*-2 . E_S
176895:8	Especially when you get done *T*-1 , you 've got something , you know . E_S
176917:25	I had a friend with a tractor who *T*-1 dug the pier holes E_S
176956:29	it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is *T*-1 , you know . E_S
176962:39	I 'd be surprised if it was n't , uh , cheaper where you are *T*-1 . E_S
176967:17	It probably comes from where you are *T*-1 . E_S
176978:5	When I drive through that area *T*-1 , that 's all 0 I see *T*-2 is \[ pressure treated , \+ pressure treated lumber yards . \] E_S
176992:30	\[ And , \+ but \] that was just when I was a kid *T*-1 E_S
176993:21	so I do n't really know what the cost of living is even like *T*-1 in Dallas anymore . E_S
177004:19	so that 's probably about what you 're paying *T*-1 E_S
177011:21	my current project is a walkway which I 'm building *T*-1 *ICH*-2 around the house and out to the backyard \[ to , \+ \] uh , you know , *-3 digging it out and laying sand and putting , uh , pavers on top of that E_S

177026:4	What do you think *T*-1 ? . E_S
177032:17	just for example , what we 're seeing *T*-1 in California I guess *T*-2 . E_S
177033:54	It makes 0 you wonder , uh , had the jury been a different group of people what *T*-1 would have happened with that outcome . E_S

177068:9	Hey , what do you think *T*-1 , E_S
177081:16	Uh , I understand why they were upset *-2 by the verdict *T*-3 just because even those of us that *T*-1 are n't black or , uh , do n't live there or whatever , we all saw the same thing \[ on the , \+ on the \] tape E_S

177166:105	\[ \[ \[ An- , \+ and so , \] \+ uh , uh , and , \] \+ and \] the reason 0 I 'm doing this whole thing *T*-1 is because Rick , who *T*-4 's another government employee wanted \[ a spe- , \+ segments \] of my speech , \[ that \+ that \] *T*-2 were done *-3 a year ago E_S

177290:89	So \[ there 's , \+ uh , there 's \] a lot 0 *T*-1 to be said *-4 for * having a steady stream of people who *T*-2 know how it is *T*-3 someplace else coming in . E_S
