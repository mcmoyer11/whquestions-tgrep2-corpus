14516:67	* growing up \[ when , \+ when \] the Cowboys were really big *T*-2

14560:34	*-2 to figure out where you could get
14679:13	They say , why ca n't we have the same things that these other people have *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S

14735:59	*-1 to , uh , figure out how * to cope with the problem *T*-3 because it has grown so huge

14829:73	they did n't know what * to do *T*-1 with it
14916:25	especially when you work out of town and everything , that way *T*-1
14940:78	*-1 to see what damage I have did *T*-2
14957:14	they 're there when you need them *T*-1 . You know , like in emergencies , or whatever . E_S
15073:23	but , uh I do n't know how we got the subject *T*-1 , MUMBLEx . E_S
15134:51	But \[ that , \+ that \] time is minuscule compared to \[ what , \+ what , \] MUMBLEx they were referring to *T*-1 . E_S

15192:46	And they 're allowed *-1 to take that time off and then come back where they left off *T*-2 . E_S
15207:85	Well , I mean , in that respect a lot of people join the military *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] grow up and to decide what they want *-2 to do *T*-3 , E_S
15216:74	\[ but , \+ uh , and \] a lot of people have gone in the military , I mean , you know , when they 're in the college *T*-1 . E_S

15254:78	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't know what I marked *T*-2 off *-3 to get this
15312:13	I forget exactly what the focus was *T*-1 on that one . E_S

15385:39	\[ that *T*-3 told , \+ and he told \] me when he gave it to me *T*-1 that it was impossible 0 * to kill *T*-2 , E_S

15580:42	\[ and , \+ but , \] you know , you could tell when it was coming *T*-1 . E_S

15753:21	Now , I do n't know how T E C would handle it *T*-1 . E_S
15871:43	and of course , you know , they did specifically single them out when we started *T*-1 , you know , that they were going *-2 to do all them first . E_S
16019:24	and I have just casually asked her what he did *T*-1 for a living . E_S
16096:37	well , it says , \[ why would you , \+ what you would \] have *T*-1 for a dinner party . E_S
16109:19	I 'll tell you , what I 'm going *-1 to have *T*-2 . Um , if I can find it . E_S
16170:25	I 've been doing *T*-1 when I get invited *-2 someplace and bring something *T*-3
16185:21	Or even have you ever seen where \[ they , \+ they 'll \] take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out , and then put the fruit in the watermelon *T*-1
16313:21	I know what you 're talk-
16485:9	so , when you pull the Saran Wrap back *T*-1 , you sort of should be a little careful , pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap E_S
16522:13	do you know who he is *T*-1 ? E_S
16539:21	I do n't like that , when they start *T*-1 , E_S
16642:13	and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it *T*-1 E_S
16679:16	Oh , I see what you 're saying *T*-1 . E_S
16685:29	I mean , I do n't even know who *T*-1 did which ones , E_S
16690:30	\[ I could , \+ I know \] which ones *T*-1 come next , E_S
16724:13	do you know who Chuck Mangione is *T*-1 ? E_S

16774:13	It 's not where \[ it 's , \+ it hurts \] your ears *-1 to hear it *T*-2 . E_S
16981:19	It 's getting , to where a just really want *-1 to read it *T*-2 . E_S

17426:21	Uh , well , you know who I 'm talking about *T*-1 . E_S
17675:67	how much you improved *T*-1 over the weeks
17831:19	back when , uh , you know , the high impact and
18004:158	they do n't explain to the jurors , \[ \[ in a , \+ in a \] trial , \+ in a capital murder trial , \] or in cases of rape , or in different things that *T*-2 are so horrible , what it means *T*-3 when they sentence them to , you know
18004:172	it means *T*-3 when they sentence them to , you know
18049:11	This is what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen . E_S
18056:37	\[ and , \+ but , \] I , do n't know what else * to do *T*-1 with some of these people , that *T*-2 are , N_S

18125:47	*T*-1 were there originally , \[ when they , \+ when they \] changed the laws *-2 to revoke the death penalty *T*-3
18216:20	and it was n't that way when I was younger *T*-1 . E_S
18224:43	But , uh , even the small towns now though , has really changed from when I was a kid *T*-1 , E_S
18341:14	right where that 's at *T*-1
18394:64	and the first thing 0 \[ the , \+ the \] old guy there at the stand asked *T*-3 is what part of town we lived in *T*-2 because he said , uh , \[ I 've got , \+ I 've got \] a dozen different varieties E_S
18589:40	And , uh , I do n't know , \[ that \+ \] what they have *T*-1 , E_S
18623:29	it be just the opposite when you get
18647:16	I do n't see how anything can survive out there , for long periods of time *T*-1 . E_S
18673:73	*-1 to decide \[ \[ what , \+ what \] * to , \+ what *-2 to \] put *T*-3 on one side of the house and things like that
18792:20	It was a real memory hog when you started *-1 making large blot changes to it *T*-2 . E_S
18834:39	uh , E_S maybe you 'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things *T*-1 . E_S
18835:114	*-3 seeing what all they can do *T*-1 for you
18932:49	and the garbage men come by and , uh , collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty *T*-1 or leave the ones if they 're still in good shape . E_S
18979:34	And it 's really going *-1 to be a mess when they have *-2 to start *-3 hunting for places 0 * to put the things *T*-4 *T*-5 . E_S
19031:120	* to get that two cents when you take it to the store *T*-1
19175:16	And I 've seen where some places have taken a plastic *T*-3 and , uh , they 're recycling them into other plastics . And the Styrofoam also into insulation and things like that *T*-3 E_S
19204:53	Now we quit that about \[ two years ago , \+ no , three years ago \] when we got china mugs for everybody *T*-1 . E_S
19245:71	* to know what kind \[ \[ of a , \+ of , \] \+ of a \] threat it is *T*-1
19249:155	they have completely chain- , N_S \[ on \+ \] the , place has completely turned that much around to where they 're \[ not , \+ you know , not \] what they used *-2 to be *T*-1 *T*-3
19249:192	they 're \[ not , \+ you know , not \] what they used *-2 to be *T*-1 *T*-3
19301:16	I do n't know what the percentages are *T*-1 , E_S
19318:79	Even if it is , you know , the best thing in the long run , it just steps on too many people *ICH*-3 's toes , who *T*-1 are comfortable with the way 0 the situation is *T*-2 . E_S
19512:11	Nobody knows what * to do *T*-1 . E_S
19521:13	But you wonder how , well , this thing , N_S
19549:19	I read *T*-1 when the , uh , \[ lee- , \+ \] uh , United Nations was setup *-2 \[ in , \+ in \] San Francisco *T*-3
19614:22	the question was , uh , what kind of books do you read *T*-1 for entertainment

19794:18	Well , you know , why they actually held them off *T*-1 ? E_S
19840:58	hell , \[ we did n't even , \+ you know , we did n't even \] know where the Mason Dixon Line was *T*-2 , E_S
19906:36	I read HAWAII , when I was about ten years old *T*-1
20027:83	*-2 even having read the book , and I 've read that book probably three times , *-2 watching that movie , I could n't figure out , what they were talking about *T*-1 , at all . E_S
20072:23	I do n't have the foggiest notion what it 's about *T*-1 , E_S
20131:23	well , I 'm not real sure why I got this topic *T*-1 , because I do n't think 0 I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws . E_S
20184:39	* to learn what they are *T*-1
20214:134	There \[ are , \+ were \] some , uh , regulations *ICH*-2 over , E_S I do n't know whether they 're laws passed * \[ or , \+ or \] whatever they 're called *-4 *T*-1 , uh , just recently , where , uh , people with certain diseases can not be excluded *-5 , uh , from , uh , immigration *T*-3 .

20363:19	* Render unto Caesar 's what *T*-1 is Caesar 's . E_S

20386:52	well you render unto Caesar 's what *T*-1 is Caesar 's
20387:17	you render unto God what *T*-1 is God 's . E_S
20411:16	And I get outraged when I feel like they go up for useless reasons *T*-1 , E_S

20758:56	you know , um , about what Louisville is doing *T*-1 with recycling
20795:50	Because *-1 to take it to a Metco , you have *-1 to take it when they 're open *T*-3 , you know , which *T*-2 is always a real pain . E_S
20809:22	I could n't even think of what you call them *T*-1 . E_S
20916:65	just what you would buy *T*-1 out of the machines and drink *-2 here
20970:50	And a lot of time , I find it during the day \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm rocking my little girl to sleep *T*-1 , E_S
21095:57	*-2 recognizing what *T*-1 was going on

21342:16	I ca n't remember what her name is *T*-1 , E_S
21393:64	and , you know , \[ you kind of , \+ you 're wondering , \] you know , well when did this happen *T*-1 ? E_S
21426:40	And that really made it a very interesting , uh , show to where you never really knew \[ which , \+ which \] one *T*-1 was going *-6 to show up .

21426:133	it was going to , where they 're going *-2 to be real close *T*-4
21434:18	and you always wonder , why they do n't , you know , get together or whatever *T*-1 . E_S
21453:39	they had what they called *T*-1 MAXIMUM SMART
21474:20	that , uh , interplay died when they got married *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
21518:47	Well , do you you watch , um , what is that show *T*-1 , WHO 'S THE BOSS *T*-2 ? E_S
21530:85	but , \[ as , \+ as \] I 've seen it , \[ they 've , \+ they 've \] done sort of the same thing to where \[ they 've , \+ they \] started *-1 to let them get together *T*-2 , E_S

21714:80	\[ Do you go , how about like for , \+ uh , do you go for long vacations , \] like a week or something when they have school off *T*-1 ? E_S

22164:29	Um , in San Antonio I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
22170:32	Um , then again , I do n't know really what steps *ICH*-2 there are *T*-1 that they , N_S

31358:22	I ca n't really see why anyone , um , who *T*-1 has nothing 0 * to hide *T*-2 would object *T*-3
31387:16	I do n't know how that 's going *-1 to affect , uh , E_S

31581:26	I 'm not sure *ICH*-4 , though , when we talk about what rules , if any *T*-3 , that we should say , well , certain segments should not have *-1 to be tested *-2 . E_S
31591:37	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know why it *EXP*-1 would be , you know , uh , bad * to test just every- *T*-2 , E_S
31703:30	it goes wrong when you try *-1 to do something *T*-2
31802:16	I do n't know why we have so much going for us *T*-1 , E_S
31841:18	we 're getting to where , we 're straying *T*-3
31858:26	\[ Yo- , \+ you \] know what eucalyptus is *T*-1 ? E_S
31872:38	at first I 'm like , oh , \[ how , \+ why \] do people like this *T*-1 , E_S
31877:16	I did n't realize what it was *T*-1 for a while . E_S
31879:16	and I 'd wonder what is that *T*-1 , you know , E_S
31913:61	but \[ \[ I do n't , \+ I , \] \+ I 'm \] so , uh , timid when it comes to * starting a business *T*-1 . E_S
32025:31	I \[ do- , \+ do n't \] know where they came from *T*-1 . E_S
32030:7	So what I 'm planting *T*-1 or actually transplanting *T*-1 is \[ a tree that *T*-3 's , \+ or trees that *T*-2 are \] already leafed out . E_S
32041:57	\[ It , \+ it \] just kind of depends on \[ what you 're , \+ what you 're \] planting *T*-1 , E_S
32640:11	you know what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
32811:26	and , uh , we really missed them when they were gone *T*-1 , because the ones from the grocery store just ca n't , compare . E_S
32825:54	\[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and , \] uh , you do n't realize how many dishes you put onions in *T*-1 , that it 's an ingredient , E_S
32893:21	me see what I got *T*-1
32906:30	*-1 to do it at home when I was a kid , had a huge garden *T*-2
32949:35	and , So , \[ because \+ \] have you seen how much pickles cost *T*-1 in the store ? E_S
32959:13	I said , why are they so expensive *T*-1
32970:37	But we 're going *-1 to try that , and see how that works *T*-2 . E_S
33061:17	you can always tell whenever they 're cooked *-1 *T*-2 if they 've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out . E_S
33088:47	Huh . \[ When you were , \+ um , \[ whe- , \+ when \] you serve \] it *T*-1 do you shell them and then serve em too ? E_S
33118:47	\[ it jus- \+ \[ i- \+ it \] just \] depends on what type it was *T*-1

33295:16	I do n't know what she calls them *T*-1 in E_S
33444:36	I was curious about that today when I saw those for sale *T*-1
33494:5	when you go over there *T*-1 does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged *-2 , either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek *T*-3 , in terms of , 0 \[ there 's so much , \+ it 's so much \] of a weight orientation , weight lifting , et cetera . E_S
33547:68	I went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas *T*-2
33603:60	you 'd be surprised \[ how many basket- , \+ how many people \] *T*-1 come in here with things like that because they are active
33695:18	And there was my ego when I went ahead *T*-1 E_S
33736:24	I said a few things to him when I got home *T*-1 , E_S
33737:13	I said , who *T*-1 has engineered that ? . E_S
33803:18	I said , uh , why do I feel like I need *-1 to start *-2 pushing myself more *T*-3 . E_S
33908:74	*-2 to put casts on when it 's warm *T*-3
33913:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
33955:60	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] had mixed emotions *ICH*-4 , I guess 0 *T*-3 , when I listen to , uh , the radio \[ and , \+ and \] watch T V *T*-2 about the different , uh , things that *T*-1 are happening . E_S
34064:85	you have a little , uh , thing *ICH*-2 \[ on the \[ bo- , \+ bottom \] of th- , \+ on top of the barrel \] where \[ you , \+ you \] turn it *T*-1 , E_S
34142:42	you do n't know how * to handle it *T*-1
34142:114	*T*-2 does n't know how * to drive *T*-3
34168:16	I ca n't remember what \[ the na- , \+ the term *ICH*-1 \] was *T*-2 going around . E_S
34212:25	and , uh , I do n't know why I never registered it *T*-1 E_S
34243:76	And if you try *-1 to do anything , uh , like , uh , *-3 not identify yourself to the government , they know who you are *T*-2 . E_S
34251:47	\[ bu- , \+ bu- , \] you know , they know so , how much money *ICH*-2 you make *T*-1 a week to , uh , probably your , uh , N_S
34253:14	I was seeing what they was banging on *T*-1 . E_S
34258:57	\[ You , \+ you \] were talking about , uh , uh , \[ Fed- , \+ what *ICH*-2 the Federal \] government knows *T*-1 about people . E_S

34417:16	but I like that where they run *-1 tense *T*-2 . E_S
34461:11	You know what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
34493:13	So , if and when we ever get a baby-sitter *T*-1 , like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS , we go *-2 see it . E_S
34512:21	and I ca n't think of which one it was *T*-1 . E_S
34542:24	He did n't look like a cop when he did it *T*-1 . E_S
34705:16	I do n't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both *T*-1 . E_S
34743:120	*-2 to be where you feel it *T*-3
34791:11	You know what I mean *T*-1 , you know . E_S
34820:16	She does n't mind when we cover up her eyes *T*-1 . E_S
34881:19	I kind of like it when they do that *T*-1 , because the video , like I said , N_S
34988:31	and we 'll , you know , look at what you want *-1 to see *T*-2 . E_S
34989:33	's just turn it on and see what *T*-1 's on
35018:14	exactly how you feel *T*-1
35020:11	You know what I 'm saying *T*-1 . E_S
35127:64	And if they saw us watching \[ the , \+ \] something , E_S they 'd say , all right , what did you see *T*-2 on WHAT *T*-1 'S NEW , E_S
35127:83	did you see *T*-2 on WHAT *T*-1 'S NEW
35178:13	and I know how everybody 's doing *T*-1 , E_S
35197:11	You know what I did *T*-1 . E_S
35282:35	it was *?* when it started *T*-1
35455:94	you wonder why did the person that *T*-3 owned it want *-4 to get rid *-5 of it *T*-6
35546:29	*-3 to interfere with whatever they 're trying *-1 to record *T*-2
35698:32	they said which dealers *T*-1 participated \[ in the , \+ in the \] fleet program *T*-2
35748:18	And I laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand mile checkup *T*-1 E_S
35761:29	he probably knew what *T*-1 was going on the very next day
35842:30	I mean , I went in the service when I was eighteen *T*-1 , And , uh , stayed in for ten years . E_S
35895:31	*-1 going two semesters when I got out *T*-2 just *-3 to get my degree
35930:81	we 're throwing *T*-1 away *-3 to pay people to go out and do things when we 're paying all these welfare recipients *T*-2
36006:46	and when you 're writing up budgets *T*-1 , you wonder , okay , how much money do we need *T*-2 . E_S
36073:14	We taught them how * to do it *T*-1 , E_S
36140:45	I learned things and learned how *-1 to do things differently *T*-2
36281:16	I do n't care what kind it is *T*-1 . E_S
36373:26	but , \[ when you , \+ when you \] work out *T*-1 , do you pretty much do it on your own schedule , E_S
36390:23	you can do it whenever you want *T*-1
36402:38	it depends on the person , depends on how motivated you are *T*-1
36438:19	So \[ we , \+ when we \] go *T*-1 , we \[ have about , \+ do about \] fifteen miles a week , E_S
36444:38	*-2 doing it more when I 've got other people with me *T*-1
36488:24	well , then I do n't know how much you 've been through *T*-1 it , E_S
36535:16	how long we 've been talking *T*-1
36664:16	I do n't know how you can really keep , uh , the inside of a tent clean *T*-1 . E_S
36740:44	\[ \[ the , \+ i- , \] \+ it \] gets cooler when the sun sets *T*-1 E_S
36748:17	I never really noticed how effective they were *T*-1 , E_S
36771:25	I do *T*-1 when I wait for a phone call *T*-2
36825:26	but they 're also , um , flimsy when you really look at them *T*-1 . E_S
36836:26	he did have a problem , uh , when he went *-1 camping last year in Beavers Bend , \[ Ok- , \+ Oklahoma *T*-2 , \] um , E_S
36847:42	do you \] do *T*-1 when you get \[ a , \+ I mean , like a \] really violent storm like a tornado *T*-2
36930:7	so when you have the basic needs , uh , being unmet * *T*-1 , I do n't think 0 you think globally as far as , you know , * being a threat to other people in the world . E_S
36935:78	So , as soon as they get \[ their , \+ their \] own home country taken care of *-2 , then they 'll consider , what they can do *T*-1 with the rest of the world . E_S
36954:89	the Bush Administration is n't too happy \[ with , \+ with \] how they 're handling their internal , uh , strife *T*-2 , you know , as far as diplomacy is concerned *-1
36985:18	but I do n't know how convinced *ICH*-1 the people are *T*-2 of him yet , myself . E_S
36992:43	So , you know , they 'll go with , you know , whoever *T*-1 comes through for them . E_S
37005:11	You know what I 'm saying *T*-1 ? E_S
37057:27	Anyway , I really question , though , how much technology the average Soviet is exposed *-1 to *T*-2 . E_S
37082:41	and of course , most of us , we do n't really appreciate what we 've got *T*-2 because we 've been so used to it . E_S
37091:57	you 've lost something \[ or , \+ or \] uh , uh , do n't have what other people have *T*-6 *T*-7
37328:57	*-1 to get where they are *T*-2
37343:54	from * speaking from my children , \[ the- , \+ they \] are n't real flexible when it comes to things like that *T*-1 . E_S

37386:68	* to , \[ a , \+ adopt \] teams when I \[ \[ wen- , \+ go to a tea- , \] \+ uh , go to a town *T*-1
37401:78	\[ eve- , \+ every \] once in a while , I will keep \[ in , \+ in \] touch , with maybe , like who *T*-1 's in the top five of hitting , or something like that E_S
37463:100	you look at , uh , \[ of , \+ of \] \[ how baseball , \+ how apparently
37521:50	\[ \[ I , \+ that 's , \] \+ I do n't \] know how Oakland 's going *-1 to react to *-2 being , uh , swept *-3 in the World Series last year *T*-4 . E_S
37578:89	\[ It , \+ it \] really kind of depends \[ on , \+ on , \] um , \[ what they were , \+ you know , what they were \] looking for *T*-1 . E_S
37590:29	\[ And , \+ and \] the question is how do you forecast that *T*-1 , E_S
37594:57	*-2 to \] bet on who *T*-3 would be in the World Series
37639:11	Well considering what I 've seen *T*-1 in the last , uh , you know , two seasons , I 'm beginning *-2 to agree with that , E_S
37675:66	there 's coming to a point *ICH*-1 real soon when ticket prices are going *-2 to be to the point where the average fan ca n't go *T*-3 *T*-4
37731:63	* to be doing what they 're doing *T*-2
37801:30	*-1 to be teaching him what we can *?* *T*-2 at home , of course , because , uh , I guess 0 we do n't trust the school system , which *T*-3 is very sad
37899:25	and * think \[ what , \+ what 's \] it going *-1 to be like *T*-2 for \[ \[ my , \+ my youngest , \] \+ \[ an \+ \] my oldest \] son , when he goes to school *T*-3 . E_S
37899:113	*-1 to be like *T*-2 for \[ \[ my , \+ my youngest , \] \+ \[ an \+ \] my oldest \] son , when he goes to school *T*-3
37913:27	it was *?* when I was going to school *T*-1
37924:45	*-1 to be like *T*-2 in another twelve years when my , uh , oldest son is in high school *T*-3
37940:80	even when they 're a teenager and they , you know are kind of standoffish *T*-2
38122:107	he could n't talk about what he did *T*-2 *T*-3
38238:21	well , N_S * depends on what you consider *T*-1 expensive , E_S
38243:42	you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars , where , you know , just a few years ago it would have been six , seven , eight , nine thousand dollars *T*-1 . E_S
38246:96	You know , E_S I guess 0 \[ \[ it 's not , \+ it 's all , \] \+ you know , it 's , inexpensive \] compared to what it used *-1 to be *T*-2 E_S
38319:93	*-1 to do what they needed *T*-2
38396:41	my hu- , he took one home \[ when they , \+ when \] \[ they had it , \+ you know , they had a \] big deadline coming up *T*-1 E_S
38424:23	half the people do n't even know who they 're talking to *T*-1 . E_S
38432:17	but , most people know who I am *T*-1 , E_S
38433:18	but I do n't know who they are *T*-1 , you know . E_S
38492:37	so most of my books are , um , I guess what you 'd call *T*-1 self improvement type of books . E_S
38536:16	I do n't know what the chains are *T*-1 down there .
38686:19	I ca n't think of what his name is *T*-1 \[ right , \+ right \] off the bat , though . E_S
38718:20	and , I do n't know when I 'm going *-1 to get to them all *T*-2 . E_S
38843:39	I neglect what I should be doing *T*-1
38848:19	You get so involved in what you 're reading *T*-1 . E_S
38890:31	and \[ I , \+ I \] still remember how * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
38920:22	you must pay all attention to what you 're doing *T*-1 . E_S
38975:14	I was reading when you called *T*-1 . E_S
39190:57	you kind of , N_S \[ even , \+ even \] a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something *T*-1
39397:30	\[ I know , \+ I know \] what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
39415:19	and I ca n't remember what else *T*-1 is in it E_S
39551:19	and I have been debating what *-2 to cook *T*-1 because one of my guests is a vegetarian . E_S
39638:24	*-1 to see who it 's published *-2 by *T*-3
39776:112	a lot of time you can \[ find , \+ find \] really good recipes where you would n't even think about it *T*-2

40068:33	uh , one game and he 'll be playing to where everything 0 he throws *T*-1 up goes in *T*-2 E_S
40107:53	Akimo Lija was the dominant player , you know , when he
40121:75	*-1 to challenge him \[ when he 's , \+ when he 's \] driving hard to the hoop *T*-2 *T*-3
40145:22	Well , that might have been what it was *T*-1 , E_S
40149:29	\[ I , \+ maybe I \] misunderstood what they meant *T*-1 . E_S
40208:11	I forget how that works *T*-1 . E_S
40233:43	*-2 to find a way when they

40648:11	you know what fun they had *T*-1 with these computer games E_S
40750:40	so stuff like that *ICH*-3 is starting *-1 to come along where it 's really , getting fun *T*-2 , you know . N_S
40776:22	and he 's always having fun when I pick him up *T*-1 E_S
40818:11	She knows what she 's doing *T*-1 , E_S
40913:25	and I have peace of mind , where he is *T*-1 E_S
40957:18	and it was like , when our ancestors first came over *T*-1 . E_S
41004:35	And , it told like , uh , you know , where the first Connallys came over *T*-1 , E_S
41009:32	*T*-1 happened when they got there *T*-2
41038:39	*-1 to kind of get used to us when we first started *-2 going together *T*-3

41075:69	everybody just cook whatever *T*-3 is their specialty , and bring it
41166:15	But , you know what you can do *T*-1 ? E_S
41231:66	what you can do *T*-1 is , you can write different places , the Chamber of Commerce , tell them what you 're interested in *T*-2 . E_S
41363:106	*-4 to tell them how many people *T*-5 were going *-6 to be coming
41374:27	*-1 to check off what all you would be willing *-2 to bring *T*-3
41387:72	\[ everybody knew , \+ they knew \] ahead of time how many people *-2 to expect *T*-1

41580:34	\[ we- , \+ you \] can pretty much wear whatever you want *-1 to *?* *T*-2 , E_S

41708:24	they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts *T*-1
41741:42	\[ you , \+ you \] make of that what you wish *T*-1
41765:39	uh , and so , then I , of course , just continued what I considered *T*-1 the best style of clothing for me at work E_S
41782:83	they are n't overly strict about what you wear *T*-3
41787:103	I mean , \[ they , \+ they \] leave it up to you and your judgment * \[ to , \+ to \] use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have *T*-1 . E_S
41814:51	you 're comfortable with what you 're wearing *T*-1 and can \[ \[ be , \+ be , \] \+ feel \] more relaxed

42336:17	they find who *T*-1 's doing that to those little girls

42736:74	\[ I started *-2 shooting , \+ my Dad started *-3 letting me shoot \] like a little air B B gun , when I was probably five or six years old *T*-1

43226:17	I do n't know what kind of trees they are *T*-1 , E_S
43390:14	I saw it when I was a kid *T*-1 E_S

43537:34	They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they 're raised *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
43541:16	I do n't know where in the world it is *T*-1 . E_S
43811:42	I went *-1 to see DON QUIXOTE over there when it came out *T*-2
43876:28	* to know what the good movies are *T*-2 anymore
44060:7	So what *T*-1 had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly . E_S

44307:69	they do n't understand when anything is being said *-1 *T*-4

44550:20	and , uh , this is what she had told the kids *T*-1 E_S

44854:16	And so they figure why *-2 go out and vote *T*-1 , you know . E_S
44855:24	*-1 to do what they want *-2 to do *T*-3
44930:19	Well I do n't know how it is *T*-1 up there E_S

55022:41	But , they were kind of closer to home \[ when , \+ when \] I struck up with them *T*-1 . E_S
55023:19	I really do n't know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to take place with the Cowboys this year . E_S
55041:24	but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there *T*-1 . E_S
55073:16	I do n't know why it *EXP*-2 's so hard * to find , uh , a good quarterback these days *T*-1 . E_S
55096:77	when the pressure is really on *T*-1 when it 's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season *T*-2 is when the guys seem *-3 to really do their best *T*-4 . E_S
55129:20	So , I do n't know how these changes are going *-1 to help or hinder the team *T*-2 ,
55232:42	I 'll go back in time a little bit , to about eighty-one , when my first real involvement with the military started *T*-1 . E_S
55273:25	And they are very , very good at what they do *T*-1 . E_S
55278:27	Their military is different from ours , to where there are extremist \[ gen- , \+ generals \] that *T*-1 actually control tens and thousands of troops . E_S That N_S irregardless of what Soviet policy is *T*-2 , *T*-3 they 're going *-4 to do what the general tells them *T*-5 *T*-6 . E_S

55335:29	Did n't it *ICH*-1 bug you a little bit why they kept *-2 coming up with all this stuff *T*-3 ? E_S
55343:58	\[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] a little bit shocked to what the U S has done *T*-1 in terms of *-2 selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years . E_S

55442:65	\[ really , \+ that 's really \] the only time 0 I ever watch T V *T*-1 , is when I 'm on the bike *T*-2 . E_S
55444:63	and that just kind of \[ gets myself , \+ uh , gets me , \] you know , to where I 'm not quite as tired *T*-1
55459:18	And I have n't figured how *-1 to get that soft *T*-2 , E_S
55499:24	you can do what you want *T*-1
55501:37	and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing *T*-1 . E_S
55526:34	They call it aqua exercise , I guess is what they call it *T*-1 . E_S
55644:32	Uh , did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I *T*-1 ? E_S
55650:18	so I 'm very limited what I do *T*-1 . E_S
55698:55	*-2 watching what I ate *T*-3
55766:46	*T*-1 to do what they did *T*-2

55813:36	you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so , to what your gear is *T*-1 . E_S
55818:17	it would depend upon which one you want *T*-1 . E_S
55828:41	it all depends , you know , for everyone their own what they want *-1 to do *T*-2
55854:56	Well , you know , \[ I 'm \+ like , I 'm \] not really sure what I think *T*-1 about this . E_S

57474:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
57493:18	and a woman asked me what that meant *T*-1 E_S
57544:27	I could remember where all those other things went *T*-1
57547:40	I tried *-1 to remember *ICH*-3 as I took stuff off where it went *T*-2 , E_S
57548:50	I had too many nuts and bolts left * over when I got it all put *-1 back together *T*-2
57554:23	And , uh , I bought it when we were living in Lubbock *T*-1 , E_S
57570:29	I 'd know where * to start *T*-1 with a diesel

57631:30	a pickup was n't what I really needed *T*-1
57651:63	Detroit or whoever it is *T*-1 made a major mistake , years ago when they stopped *-2 putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes *T*-3

57741:16	And I said well where are the other three *T*-1 . E_S
57757:106	Well when they went to the , N_S started with the newer engines *T*-1 , you know , E_S when they started *-2 putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines *T*-3 is where they started *-4 getting into so much , you know , trouble *T*-5 .

57971:25	and he did \[ what , \+ what \] he said *T*-1 E_S

58049:67	I mean , \[ \[ it was , \+ they 're , \] \+ they still do n't \] know what they were there for *T*-1 . E_S

62922:16	that makes a difference when you have somebody 0 * to go with *T*-1 and 0 *T*-2 to do the same the same thing *T*-3 . E_S
62931:16	I do n't know what the name of it is *T*-1 anymore . E_S
62947:16	but I hate it when I 'm doing it *T*-1 . E_S
62954:12	Even when she does n't go to the health club *T*-1
62997:19	I kind of enjoy it when I 'm doing it *T*-1 .
63057:33	I have more energy when I exercise *T*-1
63061:16	I do n't know why I do n't do more *T*-1 , E_S
63131:26	*-1 to see how you work *T*-2
63176:47	They even have some , uh , \[ aerobic , \+ uh , water aerobics \] when the weather gets nice *T*-1 out in the pool . E_S
63224:48	the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced *-2 , from what I 've heard *T*-1
63259:18	one of them is where you just take whatever *T*-1 's already standard *T*-2 E_S
63259:32	you just take whatever *T*-1 's already standard *T*-2
63304:19	so you can figure out what you 're actually paying *T*-1 for it . E_S
63344:16	I do n't remember what the other one is *T*-1 E_S
63378:29	And then you end up with a decimal , where you start *-1 getting into mils , and that sort of thing *T*-2 . E_S
63385:46	that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was 0 all overseas designs were in microns *T*-1
63473:18	but I 'm not sure what they do *T*-1 in England now . E_S
63532:43	back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit *T*-1
63572:29	At that time , anyway , that was still when things were , N_S
63582:23	*-1 to know where you are *T*-2 because anything that *T*-3 was the old canal zone is going *-4 to be miles per hour
63634:5	where you work *T*-1 , do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that ? E_S
63646:17	so , uh , mainly what they serve *T*-1 in there is juice and coffee and tea . E_S
63673:21	and they put them right near where they have the time cards *T*-1 . E_S
63714:57	* turning off \[ my fountain , \+ I mean my water \] faucet , in the sink when I brush my teeth *T*-1 . E_S
63729:16	I ca n't remember what my score was *T*-1 , E_S
63740:135	\[ I , \+ I \] wonder about some of the \[ prod- , \+ products \] that they do n't take *T*-1 , like some of the plastics and things that they do n't take *T*-2 . Uh , \[ why , \+ why \] they could n't do more recycling with those *T*-3 . E_S
63769:100	*-1 to see subsidy by the government or something , or tax-wise or something , heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular *T*-2
63811:38	and , they do n't expand \[ or , \+ or \] contract when the weather changes *T*-1 , E_S
63842:24	*-1 to remember what it was *T*-2
63855:77	\[ I never realized , \+ I really did n't realize \] how much stuff I actually throw *T*-1 away
63860:11	You know what I 'd like *-1 to see *T*-2 a little more . N_S
64038:66	*-5 to remember \[ what it was , \+ what 's it supposed \] *-2 to like *T*-3 this time of year
64056:36	twelve months ago what it was like *T*-1
64099:20	And I go , gee , how did they form , you know , so perfect like that *T*-1 . E_S
64114:21	Uh , I do n't know how hail is formed *-2 *T*-1 * to tell you the truth . E_S
64171:113	*T*-4 always seems *-5 to get hardest hit *-6 when \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] the hard rain *T*-7
64299:34	I 've lived in San Diego *ICH*-2 for six years when I was \[ a ki- , \+ \] younger *T*-1 , and L A area , E_S
64336:19	and I was just amazed how unusual that looks *T*-1 . E_S
64354:11	I know where that is *T*-1 . E_S
64358:11	I know where MUMBLEx Valley is *T*-1 , E_S
64467:27	but now I listen to it well , whenever she does *T*-1 . E_S
64491:53	\[ I , \+ I \] could n't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says , This is Bach *T*-1 , you know
64499:35	\[ I just , \+ I just \] know , when I hear it *T*-1 that I like it . E_S
64561:27	Baltimore will play more , uh , what *T*-1 might be considered *-2 \[ m- , \+ a little bit more \] progressive
64582:102	\[ if , \+ you know , like when \] the Doors movie came out *T*-1 , you know , Doors was really on the radio *ICH*-3 there , you know . Where , you know , you 'd hear \[ was- , \+ \] one or two of their more famous songs , maybe top forty in Baltimore *T*-2 , E_S
64616:45	and \[ I did n't , \+ I never really noticed \] the difference when I moved to this area *T*-1 ? E_S
64923:23	So it wo n't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home *T*-1 , E_S
64957:67	And \[ we got , \+ we got \] a pretty good price , uh , \[ for , \+ for \] what we had *T*-1 . E_S
64995:11	I know where that is *T*-1 . E_S
65458:16	And they 're saying how there 's going *-1 to be a lot more parking for the stadium *T*-2 . E_S
65462:55	I know where I can do it for free *T*-1
65714:11	I know what you are saying *T*-1 . E_S
65757:60	You know , they want somebody *ICH*-3 , you know , \[ when they then , \+ when they \] \[ bring them off , \+ bring them in *T*-1 , \] that *T*-2 they have something , you know , a certain amount 0 * to contribute *T*-4 . E_S
65792:29	I do n't know , you know , what kind of options they 've got *T*-1 . E_S
65795:56	people know what *T*-1 is open for an apprentices in different fields
65863:74	one of the news stations . I could n't even tell you which one I watched *T*-1 . But they had on there , where \[ the , \+ the \] output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones 0 *T*-2 are exporting *T*-3 . E_S
65867:11	I started when I was in college *T*-1 . E_S
66002:17	we never know when we might , you know , get laid *-3 off or something *T*-4
66107:83	*-3 to see \[ what , \+ what \] your credit report looked like *T*-1
66244:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
66470:66	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , after the trial was over he came home and told us what *T*-1 was going on E_S
66494:53	*-1 to decide , you know , as a member of society what *T*-5 do I want *-2 to do *T*-3 with this guy who *T*-4 did this thing
66505:69	well , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it \] went \[ pretty , \+ pretty \] quick from what he said *T*-1 . E_S
66529:16	you , never know when they 're going *-1 to turn or hurt the next person *T*-2 because it *EXP*-3 does n't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt *-4 or not . E_S
66605:18	but I do n't know what I did *T*-1 to my knee . E_S
66692:37	*-1 to be so much more careful with what I do *T*-2
66702:36	* Speaking for myself I do n't sleep as well , when I am not exercising *T*-1 , E_S
66769:19	exactly where that is *T*-1
66773:11	you know where the little bridge is on North Oak Cliff Boulevard *T*-1 ? E_S
67149:16	I 'm not sure why that is *T*-1 . E_S
67256:72	it will help your balance when you 're indoor training *T*-2
67345:30	and , uh , uh , I ca n't understand why anyone would abandon this dog , though *T*-1 . E_S
67364:16	I ca n't imagine what , uh , *T*-1 would have been wrong with this dog , E_S
67555:52	*T*-1 was watching , uh , my German Shepherd when he got hit *-2 *T*-3
67603:53	but , uh , this dog , Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do *T*-1 now , as he 's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and , uh , actually paddled up against the current and , uh , made it back to the shore and climbed up E_S
67630:54	She 'd just get on the first step and lay down . You know in the summertime when it 's really , really hot *T*-1 . E_S
67676:56	\[ and , \+ uh , an \] part of \[ the , \+ the \] movie is where he 's trying *-1 to clean this dog up *T*-2 E_S
67707:37	and \[ I don- , \+ I do n't \] know how many times I 've seen it *T*-1 . E_S
67821:18	and I 'm not sure what it is *T*-1 , E_S
67847:22	have you heard where , uh , uh , a citizen was wrongfully arrested *-1 , and served time at a penitentiary *T*-2 , uh *T*-3
67865:13	But I know what you 're , N_S
67896:19	but we could never say what we would do *T*-1 if we 're not in the circumstance . E_S
67902:41	* \[ to , \+ uh , to \] kill somebody is what it amounts to *T*-2 . E_S
67912:59	* to get whatever they wanted *T*-1 *T*-2
67960:18	and I do n't remember what they are *T*-1 . E_S
67968:25	It 's for the large dealers is what , it 's reserved *-1 for *T*-2 . E_S
68051:34	strangely enough , uh , their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up *T*-1 . E_S
68052:82	Now , \[ \[ \[ my , \+ my , \] \+ my wife , \] \+ my ex-wife , \] she quit , uh , well , when she was pregnant with the last one *T*-1 E_S
68080:124	*-1 to pick \[ a s- , \+ \[ \[ a , \+ a \] \+ my , \] seat \] where the smoke would blow away from them *T*-2
68097:9	so , when we 're invited *-4 to people 's house *T*-1 , he will not smoke in their house . Which I think 0 *T*-2 is good because there 's a lot of people that *T*-3 are very , N_S
68161:29	however , I did n't like it very well when the transmission *ICH*-1 went out on my car with sixty-three thousand miles on it *T*-2 . E_S
68165:32	And I do n't like it very well if , when my electric blanket that *T*-1 was only one year old went out \[ at , \+ uh , on \] one side *T*-2 . E_S
68249:55	But I think 0 it should have been better than that , for that money , is what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
68288:45	one is only guilty , uh , when *-1 proven *-2 guilty beyond a reasonable doubt *T*-3
68305:67	but , uh , more than likely the people that *T*-1 are on \[ the , \+ the \] jury know what they 're doing *T*-2 . E_S
68315:53	they 're , uh , remarkably incompetent . And , uh , do n't know what they 're doing *T*-1 and say one thing in the courtroom
68448:44	when they go through those processes *T*-2 they kind of pick out who they want *T*-3
68607:24	*-1 to catch whoever *T*-2 's in town
68754:62	the times that *T*-1 were really fun were when , uh , we had vacation *T*-2
68765:18	there was nobody there when we were there *T*-1 ,
68813:51	I do n't know when we 're going *-1 to have vacation 0 * to do it *T*-3 *T*-2
68864:21	Well , I do n't know what our next trip will be *T*-1 ,
68866:16	well , I know what my next trip ,
68906:36	so , \[ when I , \+ you know , when I \] heard 0 you were from Virginia *T*-1 I was like , oh , okay , there 's somebody different , E_S
68915:24	I never asked him the other day how he was connected *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
69259:44	do they do *T*-1 when you went *T*-2
69311:59	It depends \[ \[ r- , \+ r- , \] \+ really \] on \[ how , \+ how \] strong a test it is *T*-1 . E_S
69545:15	the next one was when I graduated from college *T*-1 , E_S
69801:7	so when it 's July and August *T*-1 , I 'm pretty well used to the , hundred degree temperatures . E_S
69829:20	San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come *T*-1 . E_S
69850:28	* to offset what they lost *T*-1 over the last four years
69930:14	We get some when it 's this rainy *T*-1 , E_S
69965:19	we were used to , what , uh , gulf coast weather was like *T*-1 , when we came here to Pacific coast weather *T*-2 . E_S
69965:49	we were used to , what , uh , gulf coast weather was like *T*-1 , when we came here to Pacific coast weather *T*-2 . E_S
69982:43	and we thought well , we 'll take advantage of it and see what all the Pacific coast is like *T*-1 . E_S
70020:60	*-1 to have *-2 to try that area sometime and see what it 's like *T*-3
70054:26	*-2 hearing how things are going *T*-1 in Texas
70169:19	It really does , except when you have *-1 to fill them up *T*-2 E_S
70208:30	and I 'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten *T*-1 E_S
70316:18	I 'm not real sure what they 're going *-1 to do *T*-2 this year . E_S
70397:13	And they enjoy where they 're living *T*-1 ? E_S
70407:24	His mother comes in and says , why did you let him play in the dirt *T*-1 , E_S
70422:27	I was a big dirt eater , supposedly , when I was a child *T*-1 E_S
70469:14	* Tell me how yours works *T*-1 . E_S
70474:41	I introduced you a little bit to it , a few minutes ago , when I said that \[ we are , \+ uh , we 're \] on the east coast now *T*-1 . E_S
70517:60	* decide \[ wh- , \+ how \] we had been *-2 spending our money before *T*-3
70571:170	So , we virtually did that for about two years , which *T*-1 worked real well , and then moved from California where we realized 0 we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved *T*-2 *T*-6 , and moved to Texas , bought a house *ICH*-5 immediately , you know , which *T*-3 , of course , is now devalued *-4 with the housing market , E_S
70704:18	we really do n't , when it 's just taking *-2 out of the paycheck and stuff *T*-1 , E_S
70711:67	Well , I was just reading an article *ICH*-1 in , uh , a North Carolina \[ pap- , \+ paper \] today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by *-3 sitting up at night and typing at , uh , letters of applications to universities *T*-2 . E_S
70775:50	\[ \[ I 'm , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't know what other foe that would be *T*-1 , E_S
70793:165	*T*-1 were originally appropriated *-2 \[ \[ w- , \+ was \] \+ \] when the Soviet threat , I guess , was perceived *-4 as *-4 being a greater one *T*-3
70801:50	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know \[ what amount of , \+ what amount of , \] our hardware *T*-1 would stop some fanatic , I guess , from *-2 doing anything , uh , that *T*-3 would be irrational . E_S
70837:11	I see where the infrastructure *ICH*-1 is sort of breaking down , the roads , the highways *T*-2 . E_S
70844:50	I 'm not associated with what ghetto schools , \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ uh , and , \] uh , rural school systems are like *T*-1
70880:12	So , so what *T*-1 ended up *-2 happening \[ was , \+ \[ was a , \+ was a \] \] shift . E_S
70902:11	I see what you 're saying *T*-1 . E_S
70941:16	I do n't know what that would be *T*-1 . E_S
71040:28	even when we have n't had big yard *T*-1
71112:61	*-2 just doing what I can do *T*-1 on my own
71176:19	well , * tell me what *T*-1 's in your garden this year , since I do n't have one . E_S
71238:17	and I pick them when they 're very young and have very little string *T*-1 and then just steam them a little bit , E_S
71239:16	my mother picks them when they 're fat *T*-1 E_S
71647:47	I probably forgot how * to ride a bike *T*-1
71650:16	you ca n't forget how * to ride a bike *T*-2 . E_S
71736:87	she 's enjoying \] what she 's doing *T*-2
71736:139	*-4 to get out , uh , what they should get *T*-3 out of the class
71768:54	I mean , \[ \[ they , \+ they , \] \+ they \] really know how *-2 to isolate each of the different muscle groups , with those things *T*-1 E_S
71788:20	and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you *T*-1 . E_S
71870:38	you do n't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner *T*-1
71907:32	and , uh , my mom did n't work at all when I was growing up *T*-1 . E_S
71931:21	Uh , I 'm not sure what the future holds *T*-1 for that E_S
71991:70	* believe it or not though \[ the , \+ all the \] women that *T*-1 stay home are real busy when they are home *T*-2 . E_S
72006:17	\[ When , \+ when \] your wife has her baby *T*-1 , is she going *-2 to stay home E_S
72026:42	the kids have *T*-1 when they do n't have a real good family structure *T*-2
72086:35	and back in those times we pretty much were taught *-1 how * to be responsible *T*-2 . E_S
72270:71	* to read a book a month *ICH*-4 this year which *T*-1 is like about eleven more books than I would have read *T*-2 last year
72304:23	I 'm really interested in what I 'm reading *T*-1
72338:34	I really enjoy what I 'm reading *T*-1
72350:40	\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that *T*-1 . E_S
72355:16	I do n't know what you would call it *T*-1 , E_S
72366:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
72398:13	Do you know who it was about *T*-1 ? E_S
72600:49	and , well , you know , with the other part of this thing was , how do you feel that this influences family *T*-1 . E_S
72605:13	do you know how * to use them in your life or to influence *T*-1 , N_S
72628:23	but they do read . Uh , where a lot of people do n't have any interest in it at all *T*-1 , E_S
72664:71	we got our first , uh , credit card , oh , back in the \[ seventies , \+ early seventies \] when , I first got married *T*-1
72750:67	you 're not real conscious of what you 're doing *T*-1
72822:31	so , you 're a little bit more careful about what you put *T*-1 on that , even though you can use it however you want *-2 to *?* *T*-3 . E_S
72822:71	you can use it however you want *-2 to *?* *T*-3
72840:18	*T*-3 knows how many people , *T*-2 are looking at those , uh , bills that *T*-1 come in , and those statements
72852:56	those people see what it is that you are buying *T*-1
72989:46	They 're , uh , relatively nonexistent \[ from , \+ uh , from \] what I hear *T*-1 from my friends . E_S
73049:23	So , um , I can see where someone , you know , in a position like that , in a live-in capacity , would definitely be the way 0 * to go *T*-1 if \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] lucky enough *-3 to have the financial MUMBLEx 0 * to be able *-2 to do that *T*-4 *T*-5 . E_S
73129:114	And , uh , when I seen some of my friends that *T*-1 have taken that six week old baby , you know , to someone else *T*-2 , it 's just , I can imagine how emotional it must be *T*-3 .
73133:19	Well , we were lucky when our children were that age *T*-1 , E_S
73191:21	Oh , you do n't know what *T*-1 happens after they get in school . E_S
73312:33	So , uh , I 'm sort of at a loss where that 's concerned *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
73368:24	And then you do n't really know what *T*-1 happened . E_S
73372:108	we came home one night and found pieces of , um , \[ ribbon , \+ you know , hair ribbon \] tied * in a chair . Where obviously she \[ had , \+ had , \]
73762:62	So , uh , I 'm comparing my life when I was in high school thirty years ago *T*-1 to what I see these children doing *T*-2 . E_S
73773:35	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] I can see why children do drop out *T*-1 . E_S
73780:88	me wondering out at night and going where I wanted *-1 to go *T*-2
73802:37	to N_S \[ twenty , \+ twenty-five \] years ago is when we had the Washington riots *T*-1 , E_S
73823:50	*-1 to have *-2 to go over to Patterson when those riots were going on , \[ at \+ \] sometimes *T*-3
73846:56	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] what you saw *T*-1 \[ is \+ was \] what you got *T*-2 . E_S
73873:135	back \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm number one , you know , and , uh , uh , uh , * worrying about self and not , uh , seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family *T*-2
73883:151	* to turn to *T*-2 , \[ when you got , \+ when you 've got \] something facing you like that *T*-3
73904:21	exactly , why the child is that way *T*-1
73919:46	And you ca n't make up in a classroom of one hour a day , what *T*-1 's not been done *-2 for , fifteen or sixteen years at home , E_S
73970:13	And you worry when , you know \[ these \+ the \] sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children , N_S
73984:44	\[ it 's just , \+ it just is \] almost overwhelming sometimes when you think , \[ of , \+ of \] the jobs that *T*-1 is out there *-2 to be done *-3 , in order * to flip things back around *-6 the way 0 they needed *-4 to be *T*-5 *T*-7 , E_S
74018:40	*-1 to drive I think 0 *T*-3 when I was , um , a teenager *T*-2
74037:102	the worst time 0 you could \[ go , to \+ go \] *-3 work *T*-2 was when they were teenagers *T*-4
74043:50	I 'm home when they 're home *T*-1
74048:26	you are there when they need you *T*-1
74056:85	me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do *T*-1
74076:25	I 'm home at three o clock when the children are at home E_S or where home *T*-1 , N_S
74108:26	people realize how important it is *T*-1
74185:49	they 're colored *-1 by what I 've edited *T*-2
74211:36	And then * let them try some innovative things and see what *T*-2 works . And then , uh , have some sort of mechanism for * passing that knowledge along to other teachers who *T*-1 could benefit from the same sorts of things . And then from the parents ' side , have the parents support the school . Get involved . E_S
74218:18	* Pay attention to what *T*-1 's happening . Talk to the teachers . Uh , talk to their kids about school . And support the institution E_S
74293:125	so \[ it 's very , \+ it *EXP*-2 's very \] difficult * to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one , other than I guess \[ how , \+ you kn- , how \] a person scores *T*-1 in the beginning before the class and then after the class . E_S

94922:53	and I promise you faithfully , 0 I will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what *T*-1 's happening . E_S
95000:29	do you do *T*-1 when you 're consulting *T*-2
95040:35	just * writing programs when we need *-2 to *?* *T*-1 or , um , doing research , looking at the speech signal and then doing writing
95064:28	I used it , uh , quite a bit when I was , uh , uh , looking at , uh , information on a large bulletin board sponsored * by a newspaper \[ in a , \+ in \] Fort Worth *T*-1 E_S
95107:24	So it *EXP*-3 'll be interesting how much of it *T*-1 actually gets picked *-2 up . E_S
95112:22	is it *T*-2 now where you are *T*-1
95116:24	So you 're an hour ahead of where I am *T*-1 . E_S
95258:37	but I do a little bit \[ where it , \+ where it \] would n't hurt anybody *T*-1 . E_S
95348:29	so I 've already been tested *-1 once when I was hired *-2 *T*-3 \[ and , \+ and \] once since they initiated this random testing program . E_S
95379:34	You know , so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel *T*-1 , E_S
95419:17	I do n't know what kind of work you do *T*-1 , E_S
95455:54	so \[ it , \+ I mean , it \] protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that *T*-1 . E_S
95460:28	there was a court case , uh , here where I live *T*-2 , just a few months ago . E_S
95476:78	* seeing what they 'll say *T*-1 about it especially since
95478:14	* To see how that 's , N_S
95503:59	and so , \[ \[ we , \+ we , \] \+ in our minds we 're \] thinking what 's the big deal *T*-1 . E_S
95511:16	and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much *T*-1 whether they 're really concerned about their rights , or whether they 're really concerned about something else . E_S
95545:22	and my husband started graduate school , when we were first married *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
95566:22	I just , uh , spent whatever *T*-1 came in \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , \[ didn- , \+ never knew \] what *T*-2 came in and what *T*-3 went out . But , uh , \[ just , you know , like , \+ about like \] the government runs . E_S

95630:71	she had *T*-1 back in the thirties . Uh , when they
95636:41	* to see how little things cost *T*-2
95706:22	Well , then you never know how they will , N_S
95729:28	that is probably what *T*-1 happened in our house
95735:75	I was putting money aside \[ and \+ \] \[ when , \+ before \] I was married *-1 , you know , when I was working out of college *T*-2 E_S
95767:26	*-1 to do it when , you are in school *T*-2
95810:31	you know exactly \[ what it , \+ what it 's \] like *T*-1 then . E_S
95833:58	we looked at it *T*-1 in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school *T*-2
96029:21	Uh , I do not know why it is *T*-1 , E_S
96152:63	\[ so , \+ anyway , so \] \[ maybe , \+ maybe \] within a year , we will see how that falls *T*-1 . E_S
96326:53	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 we have come a long way , actually , when I think about , you know , when things were like even , \[ when I , \+ you know , just when I \] was in high school *T*-4 *T*-3 , and how it is *T*-1 now for girls *T*-2 . E_S

96403:88	\[ I , \+ you \] see it \[ \[ in , \+ uh , also in , \] \+ uh , like in \] church , uh , where more and more women are becoming ministers . \[ In , \+ uh , you know , in \] protestant congregations *T*-1 E_S

97050:16	They do not know how *-1 to think for themselves and be responsible , for themselves *T*-2 . E_S
97054:16	I do not know why God made women brilliant *T*-1 . E_S
97069:61	\[ I , \+ as a matter of fact I \] was talking to a friend *ICH*-2 yesterday , who *T*-1 said 0 she has a new policy in her home E_S

98436:74	*-1 to understand how * to handle it as a society to say \[ okay , \+ it is okay \] under these circumstances , but if you step outside these bounds , the punishment is extreme *T*-2
98448:29	my father was hit *-1 by a drunk driver when I was in high school *T*-2 E_S
98483:20	But , that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving was , uh , misplaced *-1 for years *T*-2 E_S
98513:125	they have real problems when it comes to , uh , uh *T*-1

98593:18	so we do n't know what *T*-1 is really going on , what *T*-2 is , uh , really the range of sentences or awards that *T*-3 \[ are , \+ uh , are \] actually , uh , in the end applied *-4 . E_S

98612:53	but , to me , when you do the crime *T*-1 , then you should pay for whatever you did *T*-2 , E_S
98640:50	but often juries hear only a fraction \[ of the , \+ of the \] story when they have *-1 to decide guilt or innocence *T*-2 . E_S
98666:19	stories look very different when you hear different parts \[ of the , \+ of the \] truth *T*-1

98944:30	then why * bother *T*-2
98945:21	me wear what I want *T*-1
99012:27	but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when I graduated *T*-1 and , uh , were looking for a southern school
99065:57	And , uh , you know , *-1 having gone to the University of Minnesota , I know what a big university is like *T*-2 . E_S
99074:39	this would expose both of them to what it 's , you know , like *T*-1 on a \[ coll- , \+ a smaller college \] campus

99188:15	Does your daughter know what she 'd like *-1 to do *T*-2 ? E_S
99264:63	Normally we do n't have too much , uh , humidity \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , rainy time when it 's past June *T*-1 . E_S
99270:29	You get those great big cracks in the ground where it 's been so dry *T*-1 E_S
99289:34	and \[ I , \+ you \] sort of forget how much it did rain *T*-1 E_S
99311:19	You could pretty much do whatever you wanted *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
99325:14	You probably know where that is *T*-1 because I know where Pontiac is *T*-2 , E_S
99325:38	I know where Pontiac is *T*-2
99380:19	It was real close to where I worked *T*-1 . E_S
99425:22	there was so much water around where I was *T*-1 . E_S
99545:55	and , uh , the kids go down \[ the hi- , \+ the hill \] on the sleds when it 's icy *T*-1 , E_S
99675:19	I was amazed at how many cans that we got *T*-1 MUMBLEx E_S
99681:62	maybe I 'd help *-1 supplement it , you know when they turned them in *T*-2
99720:42	and \[ that , \+ that \] has cut down a lot in what we throw *T*-1 out . E_S
99802:56	\[ What , \+ what \] *T*-1 makes me sick \[ is , \+ is \] when they show the dump sites you know , \[ and , \+ and , \] how big they are *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S

99959:22	They live down in College Station where , his parents do too *T*-1 . E_S
99980:96	*T*-2 is kind of frightening when she 's in the car *T*-3
100018:40	and so often they think 0 they 're adequately caring for themselves when they 're really not eating \[ very much \+ or very balanced \] meals *T*-1 . E_S
100176:35	\[ I th- , \+ I think , \] what do you have *T*-1 there

100252:39	*-1 to really know what *T*-2 's going on
100286:55	that would make a difference in how you felt *T*-1

100330:125	\[ \[ they , just , \+ they were , \] \+ they did \] things for people , you know , for their communities , for \[ their , \+ their , \] uh , families , for their friends , where now , I 'm not sure 0 they really do *T*-1 . E_S

100429:31	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know how young you 'd have *-2 to go *T*-1 E_S

100629:16	they do n't know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen just out front of their apartment complex . E_S
100740:30	Anyway , you know , the point was , what *T*-1 happens when public education fails *T*-2 ? E_S
100740:41	*T*-1 happens when public education fails *T*-2
100826:19	So I 'll see you when we see you *T*-1 . E_S
100856:14	back when it *EXP*-2 was n't , stylish * to do that at all *T*-1
100861:37	even when she was a baby *T*-2

100929:56	*T*-2 were there when Cheryl was two *T*-4 , which *T*-3 was fifteen years ago
100935:32	*T*-1 had changed her diapers when she was three *T*-2
101112:34	we did when \[ I , \+ \] my kids were born *-1 *T*-3
101122:25	or they 've , you know , whatever schedule they want *T*-1 from a pay standpoint . E_S
101139:50	*-2 to see how effective they are *T*-1
101164:50	big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions 0 they do *T*-1 *T*-2
101182:50	they gave *T*-1 when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs *T*-5
101204:135	* to take their children to *T*-2 when they 're young *T*-3 until they hit the preschool age
101221:13	and this is what I found *T*-1 with Emily . E_S
101257:49	\[ When I have , \+ \[ I , \+ I \] enjoy cooking when I have \] time *T*-1 . E_S

101318:41	you serve *T*-1 when you are doing a special meal *T*-2
101390:16	I do n't know what that , N_S

101459:32	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what *ICH*-2 it is *T*-1 about the enchiladas . E_S
101475:34	Um , and you can make a lot at one time when I needed *-1 to make something 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] give somebody *T*-2 . You know , like , you know , to take *T*-2 over to somebody 's house or something else *T*-3 . E_S
101647:9	So , when we 're here at home , you know , with sweets and stuff *T*-1 , \[ \[ they , \+ they do n't , \] \+ we do n't \] really do that much . E_S
101942:16	and you can tell which kids *T*-1 have been in day-care centers . E_S
102010:28	and it *EXP*-2 would n't even really matter which restaurant it was *T*-1 ,
102074:9	So , when we go out *T*-1 , I 'm always looking for something other than the standard menu , even if , it 's a Mexican Restaurant , like something other than , uh , you know the standard tacos , enchiladas , tamales and fajitas now . E_S
102201:18	but it 's not nice when they 're too attentive *T*-1 . E_S
102246:52	but , uh , oh we had \[ venison \+ venison \] chili *ICH*-2 one time . Which *T*-1 was absolutely wonderful . E_S
102253:23	well they 've never had it when we 've been back *T*-1 , E_S

102577:43	*T*-1 is why , DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie 0 we had seen *T*-2 for several months *T*-3
102616:16	my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie 's age *T*-1 . E_S
102632:22	Um , we do it more when we have company come *T*-1 . E_S
102640:20	so , um , mostly like when we go out *T*-1 , you know , it 's my husband and I , E_S
102730:16	You know right away what you want *T*-1 . E_S
102732:33	I know right away \[ what we , \+ what we \] want *T*-1 . E_S

102930:13	you know , how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it *T*-1 E_S
102946:68	I do enjoy *T*-2 when you get a good restaurant *T*-1
103081:17	like you 've seen what it 's done *T*-1 to buildings even where it 's really bad *T*-2 . E_S
103081:43	even where it 's really bad *T*-2
103093:41	that 's been very true , what he was forecasting *T*-1 about the accumulation \[ of , \+ of \] the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do *T*-2 to foliage
103096:49	Uh , I 'm not afraid of nuclear , *-1 having had that course because of how the nuclear that , uh , they use *T*-2 is not bomb quality *T*-3 , E_S
103111:20	So , I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
103129:23	we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston *T*-1 E_S

105042:18	*-1 learning how * to ski *T*-2

105059:19	and so I told everybody what *T*-1 happened E_S
105071:22	but now I 've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me *T*-1 . E_S
105074:43	and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] know how you can get injured *-1 *-1 doing much more than that *T*-2 E_S

106447:53	I do n't know how * to do anything else *T*-1
106458:28	the hardware store told me what * to buy *T*-1

107041:169	not a lot of people do really know \[ what , \+ you know , what \] it 's for *T*-5

107183:17	so I mean , how I would go about *-1 doing it *T*-2 is I would just call all my relatives . E_S
107322:16	I do n't know how yours has been *T*-1 . E_S
107456:129	sometimes even when you work for someone *T*-3 you do n't really know what they 're like *T*-4

107542:121	*-1 to check them off a list when they vote *T*-2

108524:38	I got *T*-2 when I was married *-1 *T*-3
108534:43	\[ but \+ and , \] of course , you get a lot from when you 're growing up *T*-1 . E_S
108701:28	my kids were very frustrating when they were little *T*-1 in terms of their tastes

109811:44	Lewisville was *T*-1 when , when I moved down here *T*-2

109958:25	I 'm worth a lot just for what I do *T*-1 every day , E_S

109985:14	I can see where that would definitely hinder the problem *T*-1 , E_S

110969:19	*T*-1 knows what he 's going *-2 to bring *T*-3 home
111013:18	so I do n't know what *T*-1 happened last week E_S
111111:22	Well , Texas has gotten to where it 's a real problem as far as plants , because our summers are so terribly hot *T*-1 E_S
111120:51	Some of the things that *T*-1 used *-2 to be hardy are getting to where they do n't make it through the two swings *T*-3 . E_S
111135:21	Well , the summers have gotten where they 're a lot hotter *T*-1 E_S
111210:52	back when we lived in Nebraska *T*-1

111353:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S

111701:40	*T*-1 abused me when I was a child *T*-2

115218:20	* to see how the Olympics does *T*-1 this year with all \[ the , \+ the \] N B A players playing on the Olympic team
115228:18	how close I 'll follow them *T*-1
115263:18	but , We 'll see how our predictions come true *T*-1 . E_S
115330:19	and I 've gotten to where I \[ start , \+ have started \] *-1 selling them at craft shows and things *T*-2 . E_S
115523:46	*-1 to figure out how * to make money off of it *T*-2
115589:107	I had bought it *-1 used *-2 and kept it , , uh , I do n't know , ten years and got within , uh , three hundred dollars \[ of what , \+ *ICH*-5 when I sold it *T*-3 , of what \] I 'd paid *T*-4 for it and had it all those years , you know . E_S
115589:129	I had bought it *-1 used *-2 and kept it , , uh , I do n't know , ten years and got within , uh , three hundred dollars \[ of what , \+ *ICH*-5 when I sold it *T*-3 , of what \] I 'd paid *T*-4 for it and had it all those years , you know . E_S
115680:14	It got to where \[ the , \+ \] tomorrow the boat was still sitting there *T*-1 E_S
115834:15	and are we getting what we pay for *T*-1 ? E_S
115867:25	and I read , you know , how our politicians voted *T*-1 each week in the paper . E_S
115947:28	well , did you read in the Dallas paper where they increased \[ the teach- , \+ the administrators ' \] pay by thirty three percent after they laid off all those teachers *T*-1 . E_S
116409:7	so when I heard the topic *T*-1 I was thinking of the thing down at , uh , Maceo High School in Dallas . E_S
116443:21	but I really do n't know what they can do *T*-1 . E_S
116445:48	and \[ I , \+ I \] really do n't know \[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 can be done *-2 . E_S
116448:75	well , \[ I just , \+ I just \] do n't understand \[ how , \+ of course , in my little world , how \] guns could be so available *T*-1 . E_S
116507:62	*-3 just \] kind of be aware of what *T*-2 's around them
116515:35	well , you know , the call for help is what *T*-1 scares me now because \[ it , \+ it just , \] N_S
116601:110	it comes on in the morning when I seem *-1 to be getting ready around here *T*-2
116607:40	I enjoy when I catch it *T*-1 , I do n't even know what night it 's on *T*-2 , but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes
116678:41	but I work full-time now and ca n't catch those anymore . Except when I 'm home *-1 sick *T*-2 , E_S
116682:37	and now when I watch them *T*-1 , I think , why did I ever watch those *T*-2 ? E_S
116690:7	So when I did watch them *T*-1 I was addicted to them every day . E_S
116741:30	we know what the weather 's going *-1 to be like *T*-2
116762:125	*T*-3 is kind of what we 're doing *T*-4 , * helping them get a data base for words
116828:70	we built what *ICH*-5 we wanted *-1 to have *T*-3 0 *-2 to live in *T*-4
116860:117	*T*-1 is what we have *T*-2
116908:37	*-1 to fix up when one of my daughters left *T*-2 , a bedroom to where I had a room 0 * to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff *T*-3 *T*-4
116908:70	*-1 to fix up when one of my daughters left *T*-2 , a bedroom to where I had a room 0 * to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff *T*-3 *T*-4
116946:7	so when they come *T*-1 , they have *-2 to have a place . E_S
117019:42	\[ I d- , \+ I never did \] put things up when my kids were little *T*-1 E_S
117256:16	I do n't know what the solution is *T*-1 . E_S
117281:78	So , \[ \[ I do n't know , \+ I do n't got , \] \+ you know , I do n't know \] what the solution is *T*-1 , E_S
117314:106	*-1 to do *T*-2 with my boys \[ when , \+ uh , when \] I get home *T*-3
117344:11	You know what I meant *T*-1 with rain , huh . E_S
117393:69	And , uh , *-1 seeing as you 've got some older children , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] wondering , how did you handle that *T*-2 , when they were growing up *T*-3 ? E_S
117393:90	did you handle that *T*-2 , when they were growing up *T*-3
117410:61	and then when they felt like it *T*-1 , they went out *-2 to play , you know when they \[ were , \+ were \] little like that *T*-3 . E_S
117582:73	And the worst part that I had *T*-1 with him , \[ he 's , \+ he 's \] three now was when he was , uh , about eight months old *T*-2 E_S
117586:18	and I did not know what * to expect *T*-1 from a dog *-2 having not had one , E_S
117597:35	well , puppies just chew when they 're nervous *T*-1
117607:34	So the last thing 0 he did *T*-1 was , when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard , \[ and \+ \] he dug them all up and brought them to the porch *T*-2 . E_S
117617:24	I laughed when they called with the topic *T*-1 *T*-2
117629:14	I got her when I lived in Hawaii *T*-1 . E_S
117748:49	\[ they would go *-1 jog- , \+ they would go with me \] when I would go *-2 running *T*-3 E_S
117835:18	and I do n't know why , -body 's calling *T*-1 . E_S
117889:23	I try *-1 to *?* , whenever I can *?* *T*-2 . E_S
117893:71	it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves *T*-1
118023:36	I did n't know what *T*-1 was going on *T*-2
118117:73	they did n't get *T*-3 when they should have had a budget *T*-2
118182:28	And , uh , they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate *T*-1 . E_S
118187:11	they withhold what they 're supposed *-1 to *?* *T*-2
118194:22	so now , you know , when you sign your \[ W-Four form or whatever , \+ W-Two whatever \] that is *T*-1 *T*-2 , then they always say , do you want a extra amount for state . Which *T*-3 is ridiculous , E_S
118279:56	*T*-1 just totally disrupt the classroom , where the teacher can not teach *T*-2
118426:11	how long it 's going *-1 to be on for *T*-2
118443:11	They say what aspect are you worried about *T*-1 , E_S
118592:16	and they brought up what *T*-1 happened in Killeen here recently , E_S
118700:62	\[ \[ We , \+ we do n't know , \] \+ half the time we do n't know \] who *-1 to support *T*-2 . E_S
118712:85	them know how you feel *T*-2
118726:92	*T*-1 would n't care what *T*-2 happened to us
118736:57	I 'm reflecting how I feel *T*-1 about it
118770:16	Well , you know who I 'm talking about *T*-1 . E_S
118840:14	* Tell me what you like *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
118981:50	* to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband *T*-1
118999:23	I do lots of cross stitching when I have time *T*-1 E_S
119141:22	Well , I do n't know how much you can learn *T*-1 . E_S
119151:21	Well , it is fun , what little I do *T*-1 . E_S
119154:21	I told my husband last night when I had called and they had , told me that this was a topic *T*-1 ,
119163:33	I know how * to do *T*-1 *T*-2
119223:51	but unless you have a boat you ca n't really get into \[ the , \+ where they call the \] good fishing holes *T*-1 , you know . E_S
119372:73	she likes something , is n't sure what size somebody might need *T*-1
119379:31	And so I 'm usually , uh , pretty careful when I shop *T*-1 E_S
119424:16	And you usually get what you pay for *T*-1 . E_S
119446:31	\[ you , \+ you \] pretty well know what you 're getting *T*-1 ahead of time , E_S
119540:34	we get \[ what we \+ what we \] deserve *T*-1
119544:128	people charge what they do *T*-1 *T*-3 *-2 to , you know
119546:36	*-2 asking what you think *T*-1 of this Middle East affair 0 we 've got *T*-3 going on
119551:225	* deciding whose land it is *T*-1
119619:23	I do n't understand , too , why we have *-1 to have Democrats and Republicans *T*-2 , E_S and it 's either one way or the other , E_S
119719:52	*-2 to keep up with what *T*-3 's going on in the world
119733:38	*-1 to know pretty well what *T*-2 's happening
119740:54	I know \] what *T*-2 's going on
119783:38	so \[ I am , \+ I am \] interested in what *T*-1 's going on , E_S
119803:23	but I 'm always aware of what *ICH*-2 *T*-1 's going on like that E_S
119912:11	I understand what you 're saying *T*-1 , E_S
119932:11	I understand what you 're saying *T*-1 , E_S
119933:21	and then again , I understand why they ca n't dig too much deeper *T*-1 , E_S
119949:34	I was doing *T*-1 when you called *T*-2
120021:35	*T*-1 tells you how * to do it *T*-2
120122:17	That I started *T*-1 when I was a little girl *T*-2 , E_S
120127:20	People would always bring them when they go to the countries *T*-1 , E_S
120128:35	\[ and , \+ um , and \] I did that when I went to Europe *T*-1 *PPA*-2 one summer . E_S
120292:17	Nobody came near it when he was there *T*-1 . E_S
120303:51	\[ they um , \+ ours \] would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad *T*-2 and try *-1 to perfume them , E_S
120316:32	One other question 0 we had *T*-1 is , Why do you have pets *T*-2 ? E_S
120348:31	and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had *-1 to lift him and carry him every place 0 he went *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
120436:55	\[ \[ our , \+ our , \] \+ my \] biggest memory is when we froze to death *T*-1
120446:56	we went fairly early in the season for this area , which *T*-1 is probably April is when we went *T*-2 , E_S
120457:47	do you do *T*-2 when you 're camping *T*-1
120636:23	me to learn how * to work the lawn mower *T*-1
120674:48	*-1 to put down the , uh , whatever it is *T*-2 for grub worms
120722:13	June bugs is what I 'd heard them called *-2 *T*-1 , E_S
120822:136	*-3 to sell whatever *ICH*-5 *T*-4 was pretty out there
120901:78	\[ \[ what , \+ what \] they 're , \+ \[ even what , \+ even what \] the politicians are \] making *T*-1 *T*-2
120921:19	I 'm not really into what they 're doing *T*-1 per se , E_S
120943:34	\[ I , \+ I \] really do n't know what they do *T*-1 . E_S
120966:62	* to figure out how much you are paying *T*-2 , because , * go to a grocery store , something like that , and you 're paying a little tax here
120982:18	and I do n't know what our gas tax is *T*-1 . E_S
121003:54	well , I mean , you could tell \[ just by , \+ just by \] how much money you have *T*-1 left *-2 over , E_S
121141:38	I was in , uh , Houston when I was working for a company once *T*-1
121272:33	I watch *T*-1 whenever I , oh
121283:26	*-1 to watch GENERAL HOSPITAL when I was a teenager *T*-2 because I
121285:23	*-3 watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed *-1 *T*-2
121290:53	*-3 to watch it , \[ was \+ \] in high school and college when Laura 's mother got killed *-1 *T*-2
121356:36	I did when I had babies *T*-1
121365:14	I videotape it when I have *-1 to miss it *T*-2 . E_S
121394:34	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] just know which one she is *T*-1 . E_S
121441:16	The kids already know who it is *T*-1 , E_S
121442:16	I do n't know who it is *T*-1 , though , E_S
121497:73	And then \[ I would have , \+ um , * let 's see . I usually have \] like a little theme when I have a dinner party *T*-1 E_S
121540:14	so , um , when we have friends over *T*-1 I have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs E_S
121545:18	so once in a while when we do something like that *T*-1 it 's kind of fun , E_S
121666:13	do you know what a fajita is *T*-1 ? E_S
121885:39	\[ I , \+ I \] find it *EXP*-2 very annoying when I 've worked all day *T*-1 * to come in and my phone to ring constantly ,
121906:18	but I do n't know what *-1 to do *T*-2 *-3 to stop it . E_S
122007:28	this lady does that to me at work when I 'm taking an order or something *T*-1 , E_S
122016:28	But , you know , it gets annoying when they stand right over you *-1 watching everything 0 you do *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
122084:7	so when I first moved here *T*-1 I probably did consider that an invasion of privacy E_S
122085:71	\[ it , \+ at \] first you 'd hear a lot of noise , especially at night you know , when you go to bed *T*-1
122099:64	*-2 waking up in several years at night when I 'd hear a fire truck go by *T*-1
122225:74	I enjoyed it more *ICH*-4 \[ when I , \+ when I \] watched it on video cassette *T*-1 than I did , uh , in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted *-2 every time 0 they 'd say that *T*-3
122226:32	I 'd go \[ now , \+ now \] which one could that be *T*-1 you know , E_S
122342:16	I 'm not sure where you 're from *T*-1 . E_S
122356:29	*-1 to spend money where we do n't have it *T*-2
122393:26	*-1 to do with how the kids were raised *-2 *T*-3 at home
122399:31	I mean , they 've so severely limited E_S what disciplinary action you can do *T*-1 . E_S
122460:85	\[ \[ e- , \+ e- , \] \+ maybe \] they should sit back \[ and , \+ and \] kind of , uh , decide on where the money 's best spent *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
122470:7	So when they rebuilt that school *T*-1 , they had \[ a , \+ a \] top of the line , high tech school there . E_S
122475:106	they were down grading all these other ones . Telling them what they needed *-4 to do *T*-6 *-5 to fix up this building
122562:32	well , this is what I 'm going *-2 to try *-3 to do *T*-1
122566:16	how close *ICH*-1 I can come *T*-2 to that
122582:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
122661:37	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know what *T*-1 changed that pattern . E_S
122679:17	You hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there *T*-1 E_S
122745:28	* to imagine what life was like *T*-1 without it now
122783:106	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] often pictured , uh , in my mind , you know , \[ what it *EXP*-2 would be like *T*-1 * to just , \+ what would you find *T*-3 if you just \] \[ kept on * going , \+ kept on *-4 going ? \] E_S
122799:19	I always thought well , what do you do *T*-1
122886:40	You know , somewhere they can sit down and write down what , you know , things that you 've improved upon *T*-1 , E_S
122899:21	Well , I do n't know what * to do *T*-1 about the federal budget . E_S
122901:35	and I sort of wondered \[ what your , \+ what \] thoughts you had *T*-1 on that area . E_S
122903:133	*T*-3 are being thrown *-4 around \[ when , \+ when \] we 're talking in trillions of dollars . Uh , which *T*-5 is an astronomical sum *T*-6
122928:16	I 'm not sure how you would ach- , N_S
122960:59	They make a decision based on \[ consti- , \+ constituency \] instead of a decision based on what they really believe *T*-1 . E_S
122983:110	any company or anything that *T*-1 wants *-2 to contribute to a fund should be able *-3 to do that , and be registered *-4 with what they ever contribute *T*-5
123101:30	I used *-1 to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little *T*-2 . E_S
123116:44	\[ I , \+ I \] used *-1 to watch them a lot when they were playing the big \[ iron curtain , \+ or steel curtain *T*-2 . \] E_S
123174:32	I mean , you just really ca n't tell what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen . E_S
123203:40	\[ I 'm not sure , \+ I 'm not sure \] who they play *T*-1 . E_S
123234:43	*-1 to see when he 's on a good night *T*-2
123493:33	I 'm not sure \[ what that , \+ what that \] means *T*-1 . E_S
123729:34	And she 's worked that for , oh , years , when I was small *T*-1 . E_S
123739:91	\[ and , \+ uh , and , \] uh , \[ she 's , \+ uh , she just started \] a new job at a different hospital , closer to where she lives *T*-1 E_S
123918:33	So it , um , also gives you a common bond when you do n't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors *T*-1 , E_S
124013:48	and they compared income at different points in time \[ when the , \+ when the \] father \[ was , \+ you know , was \] a little bit younger and more in his heyday *T*-1 E_S
124018:130	And even though the son was probably more successful , you know , higher up in \[ the , \+ the \] management ladder uh , \[ his , \+ he \] was actually making less money \[ when you co- , \+ when you go \] by costs of living *T*-1 . E_S
124028:19	And it 's depending on where you live *T*-1 , though , too . E_S
124053:16	I do n't know what it 's *T*-1 , uh , by you . E_S
124233:96	I had watched *T*-1 when we first moved here *T*-2
124290:17	he does n't know how many years I mean , * to pitch *T*-1 . E_S
124325:75	* see what a fine man , that , he is *T*-3
124328:46	like , uh , Ivan Rodriguez was n't even born *-1 \[ when , \+ when , \] uh , Nolan Ryan started *-2 pitching *T*-3 . E_S
124340:40	\[ were you here , \+ had you moved here \] yet when he did the exhibition at U T with his son *T*-1 . E_S
124392:43	* to put the finger on , uh , what *T*-2 's worse , \[ you \+ know , \] the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion , um , with , uh , your hydrocarbons , uh causing the damage in which
124418:29	and , you know , \[ how , \+ how \] we are *T*-1 with our love affair with the auto E_S
124436:29	\[ and , \+ and \] the computer reads whatever the ionization *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 coming out , E_S
124813:32	*-1 to get to where it was getting me in trouble *T*-2
124870:44	I have like a Diner 's Club \[ through my , um , \+ where I \] work *T*-1 E_S
125011:42	\[ one year they had , \+ a couple years they had \] where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it *T*-1 . E_S
125156:61	but \[ that 's always been something \+ that 's been a key factor \] in me , is how reliable is this car going *-1 to be *T*-2 you know . E_S
125224:11	you get what you pay for *T*-1 , E_S
125232:25	and you wonder , you know , where 's it all going *T*-1 E_S
125239:42	But you kind of always wonder , well \[ where 's , \+ where 's \] the money going *T*-1 ? . E_S
125289:124	*-2 to have enough *ICH*-5 when you retire *T*-3 0 * to live on *T*-4
125467:65	*-1 having a private person come to your own home when they 're real little *T*-2 \[ or \+ or \] something like that
125471:46	and another consideration is \[ how many infants or children are they , \+ \] what 's the ratio \[ of , \+ of \] teachers \[ to \+ to children *T*-1 E_S
125640:69	they know \[ what , \+ what *T*-1 's \] good for you
125723:47	do you consider *T*-1 when you buy a car *T*-2
125793:39	But \[ I got it when , \+ I got it when \] the eighty-eights first came out *T*-1 , E_S
125891:14	I 've got where now I can hit it \[ in , \+ in \] the air some of the time *T*-1 . E_S
125913:20	do you do *T*-1 when you 're putting *T*-2
125926:11	* See how it 's going *-1 to break or whatever *T*-2 . E_S
125936:64	\[ how , \+ how \] \] fast you 're going *-1 to hit it *T*-2
126139:53	they 're going *-1 to call me and ask me how it 's functioning *T*-2
126270:30	you could tell me what you thought *T*-1
126278:39	But as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
126316:40	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] even know how we 'd pay for it *T*-1 anyway . E_S
126342:27	I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl *T*-1 . E_S
126394:43	We were going to a football playoff game *ICH*-2 a week or so ago which we lost *T*-1 E_S
126503:13	You know , how that goes *T*-1 . N_S
126637:19	I always feel so good when I get through with that movie *T*-1 . E_S
126717:42	so \[ we , \+ we \] often sit around and say , what movies should we rent *T*-1 ? E_S
126793:26	They ask me , you know , what are you doing *T*-1 in a dress E_S
126906:19	I 'm not even sure what they are *T*-1 . E_S
126973:56	Well , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] especially interested with \[ what , \+ what *T*-1 's \] happening in the Soviet Union , uh , E_S
127050:29	I , uh , fear for the Russians from what I read *T*-1 , you know , E_S
127051:11	I wonder how they 're going *-1 to get through the winter . Food wise or any wise *T*-2 , E_S
127056:26	people do that when they 're desperate *T*-1
127109:121	Of course , if somebody \[ in , \+ in \] China can make something for ten cents and we have *-1 to make it for ten dollars because we have unions , well , I do n't know what *T*-2 's going *-3 to happen then . E_S
127170:13	But * look who she was running against *T*-1 , you know . E_S
127331:20	You do n't go out when it 's twenty some odd degrees *T*-1 , go out to the swimming pool . E_S
127425:34	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] like it when they have short stories *T*-1 . E_S
127528:21	but it just has n't been what I thought 0 it would be *T*-1 . E_S
127830:22	*T*-2 knows still , what *T*-1 \[ ha- , \+ really happened , \] you know
127857:21	Well , I do n't see how he could n't be , *?* *T*-1 you know . E_S
127949:31	and you can do it , you know , wherever you 're at *T*-1 E_S
127965:9	so , what I 'm telling you *T*-1 is n't something 0 you go out and do *T*-2 E_S
127981:56	And I do , uh , twenty , uh , leg lifters *ICH*-2 on each side . You know when you 're \[ p- , \+ laying \] on the floor *T*-1 . E_S
128225:38	people need *-1 to understand more like what a meter is *T*-3 , instead of how many feet *T*-2 in a meter or something . Just get used to *-4 using all the terms
128227:13	no one knows what that is *T*-1 . E_S
128256:56	people like you *ICH*-2 are relatively rare who *T*-1 are coming up against this problem every day
128261:54	*-1 to know how many miles *ICH*-3 it is *T*-2 to his destination
128297:49	\[ \[ Do , \+ do , \] \+ do \] you know , where you are *T*-1 , E_S do the schools emphasize the metric system ? E_S
128319:12	they learn how many centimeters *T*-1 are in an inch E_S
128342:91	a person is *T*-10 according to , uh , uh , you know , \[ what , \+ what \] they want *-1 to get *T*-2 out of school
128343:175	they can drive home when they needed *-5 to get home *T*-6 *T*-7
128373:26	I 'm thinking \[ what , \+ what \] problems my children might have *T*-1 in that , uh , E_S
128414:44	and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is *T*-1 . E_S
128536:16	I 'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and \[ the , \+ the \] old guys was *T*-1 . E_S
128711:17	I 've always wondered how he gets around *T*-1 . E_S
128799:37	Um . Well , here , uh , I 'm not sure how many Dallas has had *T*-1 . E_S
128978:29	So the humidity is I think 0 *T*-2 what *T*-1 does it . E_S
128983:29	\[ I , \+ I \] noticed when I got here *T*-1 , too
128990:35	and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it 's snowing *T*-1 E_S
129237:18	so I do n't know what *T*-1 was decided *-2 . E_S
129251:36	*-1 to tell us how they happened *-2 to catch this guy *T*-3
129368:38	cases like that , I do n't see why they would n't bring in the new evidence from the other case *T*-1
129440:19	Personally I do n't know which I would pick *T*-1 if I had a choice for myself . E_S
129554:100	* to , uh , drink \[ with the , \+ \] uh , \[ prior , \+ \] when you have the hors d'oeuvres *T*-1

129691:37	*-1 to talk about what *T*-2 's being done *-3 about recycling
129720:29	so the Boy Scout troop quit *-1 doing it when the City took it over *T*-2 . E_S
129734:18	and I 'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins *T*-1 . E_S
129841:25	And , uh , I do n't know what they could do more of *T*-1 exactly around here right now other than , uh , N_S
129851:39	am I going *-1 to do *T*-4 when I have a couple double A batteries 0 * to toss *T*-2 out *T*-3
129899:31	so I do n't know \[ why , \+ what \] that was reading it for *T*-1 E_S
130028:85	them pay \[ for the con- , for \[ the \+ you know , what they 've done *T*-1
130169:18	So they do n't know who *T*-1 killed , N_S
130257:31	and , uh , I 'm not sure *ICH*-2 really how much I pay *T*-1 . E_S
130459:38	everybody freaks out when it sn-
130494:17	I was just wondering what it was like *T*-1 . E_S
130533:25	did you do *T*-1 when you were in Europe *T*-2
130535:29	Uh , well , see , I went there when I was in high school *T*-1 , actually E_S
130711:10	Well , when you buy like , uh , canned drinks and stuff like that *T*-1 , do they charge you for the deposit ? E_S
130721:7	so when you turn in the cans unsmashed *T*-1 , you 're just , like , reimbursed *-2 . E_S
130739:7	So when we get like , uh , uh , a twelve pack *T*-1 , then that 's like twelve cents back . E_S
130921:19	Uh , * tell me where that is *T*-1 , uh , E_S
130931:16	This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia , Skillman cross *T*-1 . E_S
130979:40	how high those go *T*-1
130998:32	but , exactly what you 're describing *T*-1 is what *T*-2 happens all over . E_S
131071:18	And I 'm not sure what *T*-1 happened , E_S
131138:25	and I do n't know , uh , what the status *ICH*-1 is *T*-2 on it , E_S
131263:36	*-2 lifting what , uh , a man can lift *T*-1 and you know , \[ that type of , \+ that type of \] thing
131579:26	I mean , I do n't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen *T*-2 *T*-1 . E_S
131579:46	I even went to college when I was seventeen *T*-2 *T*-1
131588:11	we know what we 're wanting *-1 \[ to , \+ to , \] uh , study *T*-2 E_S
131614:11	We know what we can do *T*-1 . E_S
131623:31	And so \[ the second question , \+ * forgot what the second question , \] E_S
131627:15	and do we approve what other , families do *T*-1 . E_S
131665:7	So when another group \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , people step in , try *-1 to do it *T*-2 , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] tromping on our territory , so * to speak , E_S
131672:14	They tell you what our topic was *T*-1 ? E_S
131688:49	I played better golf *ICH*-3 when I was fifteen *T*-1 , John , than I play *?* right now
131880:47	\[ \[ And , \+ but , \] \+ and \] his accuracy *ICH*-2 is what *T*-1 's so startling with it . E_S
131890:28	I can get off the first tee when everyone 's standing around *-1 watching you *T*-2
132043:18	Uh , do you know where , uh , Custer is *T*-1 ? E_S
132062:11	I know where you mean *T*-1 . E_S
132106:33	So \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know where those guys are at *T*-1 these days . E_S
132135:19	how rapidly they bypassed , the three eighty-six *T*-1
132169:36	Well , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] understand what you 're saying *T*-1 , E_S
132196:22	we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened *T*-1 E_S
132205:35	this is what it is *T*-1
132227:16	I do n't know what it is *T*-1 , E_S
132233:31	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't care what anyone says *T*-1 . E_S
132421:26	It is really hard with our life style when you work *T*-1 to , E_S
132493:16	and then it got where we were n't beginning *-1 to get out money 's worth *T*-2 . E_S
132641:45	politicians play *T*-1 on where they want *-2 to go *T*-4
132785:52	and it has a lot of muscle *ICH*-1 in it and a lot of , gristle where it attaches to the ribs *T*-2 , E_S
133010:38	*T*-1 is how I heard about this *T*-2
133110:99	but , you know , if I had *-1 to make the choice again , \[ \[ I , \+ yeah , I , \] \+ I 'm \] perfectly happy with what I decided *T*-2 um , although we did just buy another car , E_S
133293:18	so I do n't know how they expect them to , uh , pass history *T*-2 when they ca n't read anything , you know , even read a word problem in math *T*-1 . E_S
133293:52	them to , uh , pass history *T*-2 when they ca n't read anything , you know , even read a word problem in math *T*-1
133304:19	well , it depends on where you are *T*-1 . E_S
133332:26	we lucked out when we moved here *T*-1
133352:63	*T*-1 did n't even learn what , uh , N_S they should *?* *T*-2 *-3 to do the work that she is supposed *-4 to teach *T*-5 , you know . MUMBLEx and according to her plan
133484:39	many people *ICH*-3 have done *T*-1 already , who *T*-2 were just less famous
133486:32	You know , I took advantage of the opportunity when , you know , he came out *T*-1 . E_S
133500:81	*-1 dying because of what he was promoting *T*-2
133581:44	I even understand why the administration is proposing , for instance , tax reductions *T*-1
133606:16	I 'm not sure how I feel *T*-3 about *-2 paying on \[ the quest , \+ the long term quests \] that tax cuts are worth *T*-1 at this point . E_S
133661:35	Oh , \[ I see , \+ I see \] what you 're saying *T*-1 . E_S
133673:28	*-2 taking what you 're saying *T*-1 at face value
133807:16	how else * to explain it *T*-1
133817:19	I do n't know even how *-1 to say *T*-2 , N_S
133841:11	You know what I 'm saying *T*-1 E_S
133868:13	Repeating patterns is what you have *-1 to check for *T*-2 \[ when you , \+ when you \] buy your paper *T*-3 . E_S
133868:57	you have *-1 to check for *T*-2 \[ when you , \+ when you \] buy your paper *T*-3
133875:24	I got a Mickey Mouse print is what I got *T*-1 . E_S
133881:28	how often a pattern repeats *T*-1
133889:52	one of them was just a \[ different color , \+ different color \] pink , is what it ended up *-1 being *T*-2 . E_S
133895:5	When you did your papering *T*-1 did you start in the middle of the wall ? E_S
133913:28	I 've had my best luck in papering when I start in the middle of a wall *T*-1 , E_S
133937:18	Uh , do you like how it 's presented *-1 on the news *T*-2 ? E_S
133950:77	*T*-1 were going on when we had Desert Storm *T*-2
134016:16	And I really know what the budget is *T*-1 , E_S
134023:26	\[ they , \+ they \] get what they hear *T*-1 from , N_S
134158:37	they 're expensive cars 0 * to keep *T*-1 up when they need service *T*-2 , E_S
134289:70	*-1 to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag *T*-2
134371:28	and , uh , I do n't know exactly where it emerges from *T*-1 when \[ it , \+ it 's \] up in the , uh , northern sectors of Wisconsin *T*-2 E_S
134371:45	it emerges from *T*-1 when \[ it , \+ it 's \] up in the , uh , northern sectors of Wisconsin *T*-2
134403:7	so when she gets home *T*-2 she likes *-1 to mow . E_S
134691:41	so you know , \[ I , \+ like I \] know what it *EXP*-2 's like *T*-1 * to , N_S
134696:15	* Depending on what *ICH*-3 *T*-1 was left *-2 of my technology * to get me home . E_S
134723:35	and it 's not too far fetched \[ what , \+ what \] they all had *T*-1 in those cartoons , E_S
134735:28	So you never know \[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 may occur , E_S
134804:18	and we do n't know who *T*-1 's handling them now E_S
135215:47	Well , \[ if \+ \] \[ it , \+ it \] depends on how elaborate you get it *T*-1 . E_S
135485:28	well and then , you think , well , how did they do it *T*-2 out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are *T*-1 *-4 kind of trying *-5 to keep up with that *T*-3 , E_S
135485:63	did they do it *T*-2 out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are *T*-1 *-4 kind of trying *-5 to keep up with that *T*-3
135528:20	well , * tell me what kind of books have you read *T*-1 ? E_S
135642:15	* starts out when they 're small *T*-1 and continues through generations E_S
135688:13	And * think how rich she is *T*-1 . E_S
135777:60	and then when it came out *T*-1 , all 0 I heard *T*-2 was just , oh , how bad it was *T*-3 , that I did n't even want *-4 to get it . E_S
135910:39	actually \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] seen it where there 's not a cloud in the sky *T*-1 , E_S
135972:43	Uh , \[ I skied , \+ we skied \] California a bunch when we lived out there *T*-1 , E_S
136104:39	I watch CHEERS *ICH*-1 sometimes . And , mostly just movies , when there 's a good movie on *T*-2 . E_S
136156:35	they know what *T*-1 happened
136355:31	how long they 're going *-2 to keep *-3 doing that for *T*-4
136472:68	a fellow go up there and do whatever *T*-3 needed *-1 to be done *-2 on the shingles
136499:86	*-2 to remember where you are *T*-1 at all times
136574:19	I do n't know quite how that works *T*-1 . E_S
136638:35	You actually , of course , spend less time with them when they get older *T*-1 , E_S
136875:21	You 're kind of like , what are you talking about *T*-1 E_S
136884:48	a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what *T*-2 's
137051:18	Uh , Idaho , is where I live *T*-1 , E_S
137089:39	We usually go over to Bear Lake *ICH*-2 in the summer , which *T*-1 is kind of on the border of Idaho and Utah , E_S
137156:41	that \] became a craze when she was already , oh , like , you know , third , fourth , fifth grade *T*-1
137203:46	\[ they 've , \+ they had *T*-1 \] when my daughter was playing with Barbies *T*-2
137318:54	and \[ the , \+ \] when you do buy things *T*-1 , you probably watch what \[ kind of , \+ type of \] MUMBLEx . N_S
137372:19	Nights were cool enough to where they 're comfortable *T*-1 . E_S
137435:20	I had been there before when I lived in California *T*-1 , E_S
137511:16	I do n't know why I got stuck *-1 down here in Texas now *T*-2 . E_S
137651:38	I mean , everybody was real upset , you know , when they fired Tom Landry *T*-1 , E_S
137705:49	you ca n't really go by what *T*-1 happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they 've had injuries that *T*-2 heal
137830:14	I was wondering where that came from *T*-1 E_S
137933:25	If it does , people go , what 's this stuff *T*-1 . E_S
137947:20	and it *EXP*-1 was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane , manly , adult men into playful little children *T*-2 . E_S
138118:32	they started what they called *T*-1 reach *T*-2
138156:34	We would n't have thought of *-1 crossing a teacher when we were in school *T*-2 . E_S
138218:50	it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi 's *T*-2
138250:26	you kind of act how you 're dressed *-1 *T*-2 a little bit
138335:76	* \[ to , \+ to \] suit whatever equipment you have *T*-1
138346:23	dado joints is what it 's called *-1 *T*-2
138379:33	Radial arm saw is , I guess 0 *T*-3 , what they 're called *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
138589:57	they 'll play with whoever *T*-1 's there
138605:16	I do n't know how , uh , people , uh , that *T*-1 have young kids working work full time \[ \[ and , \+ and \] \+ \] do it , really , without *-3 being stressed out all the time *T*-2 . E_S
138622:62	* to always feel , gosh , E_S what , N_S is this important what I 'm doing *T*-1
138642:27	even when we go out for a few hours *T*-2
138690:33	So we live in a society *ICH*-2 , though , where everyone if you ask them on polls , will , uh , say that they think that everyone has a right to health care *T*-1 . E_S
138694:42	we 've ever quite decided who *T*-1 's really supposed *-2 to pay for it
138699:15	*T*-1 is why people are talking about *T*-2
138716:38	But I have been in a situation *ICH*-2 , uh , recently where I was laid *-1 off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year *T*-3 E_S
138836:24	but they did n't know for sure what it was *T*-1 , E_S
138852:21	uh , I do n't remember what they call it *T*-1 , sort of like a positive , negatives or \[ some , \+ some \] kind of word 0 they use *T*-2 when \[ a , \+ \] uh , you get \[ a , \+ uh , a \] positive indication of drugs *T*-3 , E_S but \[ there 's not really , \+ there were n't really \] any there *T*-3 . E_S
138852:102	they use *T*-2 when \[ a , \+ \] uh , you get \[ a , \+ uh , a \] positive indication of drugs *T*-3 , E_S but \[ there 's not really , \+ there were n't really \] any there *T*-3
138857:24	and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
139019:33	me to remember where I was *T*-1 when all that happened *T*-2
139019:47	I was *T*-1 when all that happened *T*-2
139243:56	You do n't think about that as \[ a career , \+ a normal career , \] uh , when you 're thinking of things that people might be doing *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
139323:14	* tell me what you think *T*-1 about the Vietnam war . E_S
139335:16	And so this is what *T*-1 \[ trigger- , \+ ultimately triggered \] us , uh , United States , uh , per se , \[ being , \+ uh , deciding \] *-2 to get out of the role of world policeman . E_S
139360:61	Jane Fonda \] \[ did , \+ did \] what she did *T*-1
139387:11	* Wonder what *T*-1 happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something . E_S
139431:11	Seventy-four is when they quit * sending troops *T*-1 . E_S
139466:57	And so I do n't like \[ * to arrive , \+ \[ or , \+ or \] when they arrive *T*-1 , \] for me to be completely worn *-2 out . E_S
139477:14	everybody just says how wonderful it is *T*-1 , E_S
139764:23	a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up \[ the , \+ with the \] soup and the wine *T*-1 E_S
139768:77	* put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want *-1 to do that , you know . What ever , however much effort you feel like *-2 putting *T*-3 into it . E_S
139909:21	Um , I do n't know how familiar *ICH*-2 you are *T*-1 with that area of the country E_S
139943:42	well , um , my parents ' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River *T*-1 had it continued that far . E_S
140199:9	So , when the guy came over *T*-1 , he was infatuated *-2 by that skunk , E_S
140243:20	someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school *T*-1 , E_S
140322:16	They knew the sucker when they saw one *T*-1 . E_S
140333:34	*-1 to do a lot more repairs *ICH*-4 when cars were easy 0 * to work on *T*-2 *T*-3 , than I do now
140758:19	* Kind of depends on when they get in *T*-1 , you know . E_S
140781:55	they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that *T*-1 did n't have any *T*-2 *T*-3
140867:33	\[ it gets , \+ it gets \] frustrating when you take it outside *T*-1 E_S
140874:35	Does it just want *-1 to sniff around and play when it 's outside *T*-2 ? E_S
140948:69	and so \[ it , \+ I mean this dog \] really feels like it 's being killed *-1 or something when you try *-2 to , you know , tug on it *-3 to walk it *T*-4 . E_S
141236:59	you had *T*-2 when you were single *T*-1
141289:11	That is why we only do it once every five or ten years *T*-1 . E_S
141302:19	see that is kind of what *T*-1 happened with ours . E_S
141303:11	That is why we have not had one in a long time *T*-1 . E_S
141421:51	Well , but the majority of them are \[ in , \+ like , just like how you said *T*-1 in \] \[ close , \+ close \] quarters . E_S
141481:30	that is probably why our is probably so interesting *T*-1
141519:13	Do you know what *T*-1 is on the way yet ? E_S
141598:13	but that is where the , kind of , N_S
141638:11	history is what their peace class is *T*-1 this year . E_S
141693:16	Sledding , that is what you have got *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
141801:28	And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I 'm home *T*-1 . E_S
141805:91	if there 's \[ big , \+ big \] news , I 'll hear it from my husband *ICH*-2 when he gets home *T*-1 or , someone else
142032:165	\[ \[ you , \+ uh , you know , you , \] \+ you \] tell the person \[ what , uh , news there , \+ uh , you know , \[ where their , \+ where they \] find their sources of information from *T*-2
142076:14	That is usually where we play *T*-1 , E_S
142080:20	or do you pull a cart when you play golf *T*-1 ? E_S
142128:19	it is half price what the normal green fees are *T*-1
142132:13	So that is why we you know play over there *T*-1 E_S
142180:37	Well , you need *-1 to , uh , teach them how * to play *T*-2 and take them out on the course with you . E_S
142190:24	I only took lessons for golf when I was in college *T*-1 . E_S
142220:11	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S

158764:100	Well , do you think that , uh , we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and , uh , you know , move on into Kuwait and see what *T*-1 happens ? E_S
158836:29	I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you 're in *T*-1 . E_S

159271:44	*T*-1 knows how it fits *T*-2 into the , uh , kind of the rate for different MUMBLEx
159313:16	And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing *T*-2 because they can be schooled *-1 in that kind of thing , E_S
159334:75	*T*-1 is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages *T*-2

165017:36	There was n't as many advanced placement courses *ICH*-3 , uh , when I was a senior *T*-1 that some other schools had *T*-2 . E_S
165043:29	and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid 's teacher 's name is *T*-1 . You know , E_S
165067:11	I know what they 're learning *T*-1 E_S
165374:11	I know what *T*-1 needs *-2 to be done *-3 E_S
165572:11	You know how that goes *T*-1 , E_S
165641:53	and \[ we 've had , \+ uh , they 've always had , \] uh , where they match your funds *T*-1 , you know , E_S
165754:44	okay , now what can we afford *T*-3
165803:34	Now , I \[ have , \+ know \] exactly what I 'm spending *T*-1 E_S
165821:38	And , uh , supposedly , they 've got great customer satisfaction from what things I 've heard *T*-1 . E_S
165905:47	I 've driven some , uh , Tauruses *ICH*-2 over the last couple of years when I 've been on business trips *T*-1 . Uh , as rental cars . E_S
165987:35	and you just get so depressed for the U S auto makers when you do that *T*-1 . E_S
166277:11	You know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
166286:17	and I certainly see how much *ICH*-2 I pay *T*-1 in real estate taxes every year . E_S
166302:96	But , uh , \[ \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't understand the , \] \+ uh , I do n't understand , \] I guess 0 *T*-1 , why the schools \[ don- , \+ \] seem *-2 to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities *T*-3 . E_S
166306:29	But then , again , I 'm not quite sure where the blame ought *-1 to be put *-1 *T*-2 . Uh , because \[ the , \+ the \] dropout rate is , in those areas , w- , N_S
166312:85	them to know \[ \[ which , \+ which , \] \+ which \] part *T*-1 is best 0 * to fix *T*-2
166320:24	I meant when I said the school *T*-2
166465:93	*-1 to act a little bit different \[ \[ when they , \+ when their jobs and their , \] \+ when it 's a job \] and not just , you know
166504:44	Well , \[ I can see , \+ I can see \] definitely how you get into that *T*-1 . E_S
166659:16	I do n't know how my Eagles are going *-1 to do this year *T*-2 . E_S
166671:13	Do you know where that is *T*-1 ? E_S
166731:84	Well , uh , one of the things \[ that , \+ uh , that \] I found *T*-1 to be , uh , an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card *T*-2 and they ask me *-3 to put my telephone number \[ on the , \+ on the , \] uh , credit card bill *T*-2 . E_S
166750:13	and I say what are you going *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
166799:24	you wonder what other lists *ICH*-5 *ICH*-6 you 're own *T*-1 that *T*-2 have been made *-3 , uh , public that you , do n't know about *T*-4
166837:30	Uh , and that 's also happened to me where I 've given money to my old Alma Mater in college *T*-1 . E_S
166912:38	But , uh , my great-grandfather was put *-1 in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three *T*-2 . E_S
166993:42	I 'm always challenged *-2 peremptorily also when I go to these things *T*-1
167068:42	*-1 to be notified *-2 of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury *T*-3
167080:22	it comes to what kind of sentence you 're going *-1 to lay *T*-2 down *T*-3
167088:21	So , \[ you , \+ what you 're \] saying *T*-1 is this , if there is the second offense , then you execute them . E_S
167142:56	it *EXP*-3 's not my responsibility * to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe 0 they are owed *-1 *T*-2 even though , you know , the revenue stream went to another state
167158:18	*T*-1 is exactly what businesses do *T*-2 at the present
167315:13	Did they find who *T*-1 killed him ? E_S
167592:19	and we budget them into what we call *T*-1 \[ our , \+ our \] needs and wants list . E_S
167602:62	\[ And , \+ uh , and \] we 're continually putting into those , you know , each month how much we 're going *-1 to need *T*-2 E_S
167655:40	Well , a lot of that , uh , I do n't know how safe it is *T*-1 . E_S
167721:115	* just looking in our checking account and saying well we 've got enough and getting it , and then when something comes up *T*-2 , you know , kind of scrimping * to pay for a medical bill
167777:39	and I also get my own money 0 * to do what I want *-2 to *?* *T*-1 . Go to lunches , you know , and do that kind of thing *T*-3 . E_S
167781:70	we put how much we figure 0 we need *T*-1 each month on clothing *T*-2
167804:13	and we know which month we 'll enough *ICH*-1 saved * * to go *-2 buy those . E_S
167894:60	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] mean I just ca n't even picture how that could happen . You know , except maybe to someone who *T*-1 's , you know , really badly learning , uh , disabled or something *T*-2 . E_S
167904:84	but \[ \[ I still , \+ I mean , I learned * to read , \] \+ started *-1 learning *-2 to read \] when I was in kindergarten *T*-3 , you know . E_S
167908:50	\[ I ca n't really \+ I ca n't \] say what it *EXP*-2 would be like *T*-1 * to , uh , grow up in a really oppressed region
168021:48	*-2 to hit pollution levels *ICH*-3 now on the Wasatch front which *T*-1 match that of L A a few years ago
168067:128	they 're , uh , looking at the emissions from the car *-2 using basically a spectrometer and looking at \[ the , \+ \] basically how much of what *T*-1 is coming out of the exhaust *T*-3
168122:88	* to see \[ why , \+ why \] I keep *-1 driving *T*-2
168518:70	he can , uh , \[ do what he wi- , \+ do what he wishes *T*-2 \] with the money that I put *T*-1 in the bank
168574:33	*-1 to be doing *T*-2 when he turns into an adult *T*-3
168621:55	but \[ it 's , \+ but I think 0 it 's \] relatively unimportant compared to what 's the most effective way of , * dealing with crime *T*-1 E_S
168668:30	the other thing that *T*-1 bothers me is when it becomes a political issue *T*-2 because \[ I do n't really think 0 it , \+ uh , I do n't really think 0 it 's \] a very important aspect of * fighting crime or law and order or anything else . E_S
168818:55	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] took great pleasure in * reading to my kids when they were little *T*-1 E_S
168902:182	*T*-5 um , you know , have , who *T*-6 knows , how much , you know , stuff about all the purchases that you 've made *T*-7 and everything *T*-3 kept tract *-8 somewhere
168902:197	*T*-6 knows , how much , you know , stuff about all the purchases that you 've made *T*-7 and everything *T*-3 kept tract *-8 somewhere
168908:41	I do n't know \[ how much the stuff actually , \+ what they actually have *T*-1 \] in there E_S
168942:7	So what that means *T*-1 is , to me , that really it 's the government that *T*-2 's requiring this , E_S
168972:54	it kind of borders on \[ where , \+ I mean what \] do you value *T*-1 more . The invasion of , uh , the person 's privacy or the possible danger to , you know , other people
169004:22	how exactly I feel about that *T*-1
169056:16	that probably is not what *T*-1 was comprehended *-2 . E_S
169067:25	that was not what they had *T*-1 in mind either
169144:66	you look \[ at , \+ at \] Minneapolis as compared to where I used *-1 to live *T*-2 *T*-3
169191:16	Do you have that where you live *T*-1 E_S
169237:14	exactly what they 're going for *T*-1
169263:44	Like one of the guys 0 I work with *T*-1 really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis *T*-2 because he 's from Detroit E_S
169299:16	I 'm not sure where we went *T*-1 from there , E_S
169324:34	*T*-3 is what I choose *-1 to do *T*-2
169493:30	and for awhile I did n't read a newspaper when I came out here *T*-2 because I did n't find one that I liked *T*-1 . E_S
169521:46	me understand what *T*-1 was going on
169578:73	they , you know , maybe know what \[ the , \+ the \] norm *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 for a particular thing
169736:70	I 've \[ prac- , \+ practically \] forgot who Noriega was *T*-1
169844:26	\[ How , \+ do you know how \] wrong they are *T*-1 ? E_S
169865:96	and if they would just say oh , this person 's drug test is positive we wo n't hire them you know . Then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything *T*-1 . E_S
169893:18	I 'm not real sure how I feel *T*-1 about it because I can see it from two ways . E_S
169912:14	I can see where it could become a problem *T*-1 . E_S
169954:33	uh , I do n't know \[ how , \+ how \] old you are *T*-1 , E_S
169994:31	* to tell how much of that *T*-3 rubs off on those who *T*-1 are struggling *-4 \[ to r- , \+ to retain , \] uh , clarity , say , uh

170010:103	*-3 to have , what you 'd perceive of *T*-4 as genuine concern
170022:80	\[ the , \+ uh , the \] \] staff \[ l- , \+ learn \] what *T*-1 's normal for this person
170023:128	they do n't really need what they think 0 they need *T*-1 *T*-2
170027:104	*-2 to respond to people 's needs where the needs are sometimes , depending on the person , not going *-3 to be what we would perceive of *T*-1 as rational need *T*-4
170027:150	*-3 to be what we would perceive of *T*-1 as rational need *T*-4
170051:38	and it did n't look like , uh , you know , how , \[ \[ yo- , \+ you , \] \+ you \] walk into some rooms *T*-1 E_S and \[ there 's , \+ it 's \] completely generic . E_S
170061:57	part of what you 're saying *T*-1 matches what I \[ h- , \+ have \] read *T*-2
170072:25	and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation *T*-1 . E_S
170113:94	But , really , \[ \[ \[ \[ I 'm , \+ I happy , \] \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ well I 'm \] curious how other people live *T*-1 . E_S
170147:56	*-2 writing down what we 'd spent *T*-3
170177:122	I could see at the end of a month how much I spent *T*-2 on food
170256:26	you 're extravagant on how you buy food *T*-1
170312:124	*-8 to think of \[ what , \+ uh , uh , what \] things *ICH*-5 *T*-4 were important , uh , besides salary \[ and a , \+ and a \] job . I guess , uh , MUMBLEx
170360:16	I do n't see how one or two people , maybe more one or two , but , you know , a number of people \[ can , \+ can \] be the downfall of \[ com- , \+ a company \] situation *T*-1 . E_S
170369:52	those ten people did *T*-1 when the company was doing well *T*-2
170480:13	So I understand how that worked *T*-1 . E_S
170492:24	it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more *T*-1
170560:46	and , of course , the competing itself , really * *EXP*-1 did n't matter what it was *T*-2 , E_S
170564:23	I did not work , uh , when I did this *T*-1 . E_S
170581:16	I do n't know how \[ my , \+ my \] parents did it *T*-1 . E_S
170587:23	Uh , but I do n't know how my father did it *T*-1 . E_S
170601:16	I do n't know how it is *T*-1 in Georgia E_S
170630:79	the cost of living is outrageous compared \[ to , \+ to \] where they came from *T*-2
170691:34	's \[ ge- , \+ \] see how much money we can get *T*-1 out of her
170754:21	and I did n't even know what one was *T*-1 . E_S
170802:16	I do n't know what the solution to that is *T*-1
170825:13	so I know what they 've said *T*-1 . E_S
170884:91	\[ If , \+ if \] you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that *T*-1 can take care of you , then you stay where you are *T*-2 . E_S

170913:22	you ca n't always get in when you want *-1 too *?* *T*-2 E_S
170922:29	And the money *ICH*-3 is also another issue . How you 're going *-1 to pay for it *T*-2 . E_S
170969:74	* to find \[ wha- , \+ what \] most parents would want *T*-2
170979:57	you would want *T*-2 when you buy a car or refrigerator something *T*-1
171030:64	those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them *T*-1
171137:34	Well , uh , I ca n't be terribly authoritative on what life was like *T*-1 thirty years ago , uh , because I 'm not that old yet . E_S
171174:43	a business associate of mine \[ was , \+ was \] talking about how it used *-1 to be where you would send things through the mail *T*-2 *T*-3 E_S
171174:64	*-1 to be where you would send things through the mail *T*-2 *T*-3
171239:24	You know , I 'm wondering what this is going *-1 to do *T*-2 in ten and twenty years . E_S
171297:23	So . And I do n't know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen . E_S
171319:55	You know , \[ I , \+ I \] attended a trial in , uh , Germany when I was a student *T*-1 E_S
171367:46	maybe I 'm \[ too , \+ too , \] uh , uh , conservative when it comes to that *T*-1 . E_S
171368:39	\[ Th- , \+ the \] sentencing is really light compared to what I think 0 they should be *T*-1 in a lot of cases you know ,
171379:158	*-3 to decide for one case , on one person , based on what they see *T*-5
171616:79	Just , basically when the statements come in *T*-1
171643:29	\[ And , \+ but \] I know how much *ICH*-1 I have *-2 to bring *T*-3 in a month . E_S

171668:42	and , uh , I have *-1 to balance , more or less , what I get *T*-2 from the state with my bills and , uh , you know , try *-3 to work as many days as possible . Any time 0 they call me in *T*-4 . E_S
171717:16	I do n't know what a shoe company 's doing *T*-1 *-2 running a computer company . E_S
171806:53	Well it *EXP*-2 will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what *T*-1 happens now 0 you , N_S
171821:20	Well , it depends on where *ICH*-2 you 're from *T*-1 in Texas . E_S
171946:23	but , uh , now they have what *T*-1 's called *-2 the World Football League E_S
171969:21	So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff *T*-2 . E_S
171973:31	and \[ I , \+ I \] can see what you 're saying *T*-1 about the male bonding E_S
172207:26	that may be where jury use is overdone *-1 *T*-2
172245:23	well I was called *-1 once when I was nineteen *T*-2 E_S
172310:84	so \[ I , \+ I 've \] had an I B M clone *ICH*-2 , I guess 0 *T*-3 , for a couple of years now , which I 've been trying , continually upgrading *T*-1 I guess . E_S

172389:172	my family , when I was growing up *T*-2 , we got a basic computer . T R S Eighty when they first came out *T*-3

175349:16	I do n't know how it works exactly *T*-1 E_S
175362:26	\[ Yo- , \+ you \] know what I 'm saying *T*-1 ? E_S
175474:50	but , uh , you know , sometimes you do n't get tuned *-2 in to what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
175475:205	*-4 to know what *T*-2 's going on
175533:58	and \[ every , \+ all \] the other employees are going *-1 to come around and see what sort of things we do *T*-2 . Which I thought 0 *T*-3 was kind of interesting \[ \[ and , \+ But , \] \+ uh , but \] \[ that , \+ that \] \[ sort , \+ sort \] of thing . N_S
175540:69	you understand what *T*-1 's going on
175577:55	He needs *-1 to do his own course of investigation \[ and , \+ and \] see what he can do *T*-5 because who *T*-2 knows what *T*-3 's going *-4 to happen in another thirty years . E_S
175577:86	*T*-2 knows what *T*-3 's going *-4 to happen in another thirty years
175589:83	*T*-3 is \[ what he , \+ what he \] was working on *T*-1
175595:33	\[ I guess , \+ I guess \] by what you said *T*-1 0 \[ you 're , \+ you do n't \] feel 0 your , uh , privacy has been \[ inva- , \+ invaded *-2 \] anytime recently ? E_S
175599:77	Uh , \[ \[ u- , th- , \+ uh , th- , \] \+ the \] only thing that *T*-1 annoys me is when , uh , people call and \[ they , \+ uh , you \] have solicitation calls *T*-2 . E_S
175613:92	you get those calls \[ and , \+ \] you know , when you 're sitting at home wanting *-1 to relax \[ or , \+ or \] whatnot *T*-2 *T*-3
175741:105	Well , \[ \[ I 'm , \+ uh , I , \] \+ I \] was just , uh , in high school I guess 0 *T*-2 \[ when it , \+ when it \] ended *T*-1 . E_S
175754:23	I 've never really totally understood what our purpose *ICH*-2 was *T*-1 over there . E_S
175755:40	we did n't really do anything when we went over *T*-1
175785:49	And I was thinking in the course of * talking to him about it , how , uh , in World War Two , the personalties of Stalin , Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war *T*-1 E_S
175828:30	\[ You knew , \+ you knew \] who *T*-1 was good . E_S
175829:11	You knew who *T*-1 was bad . E_S
175833:118	you , \+ \] you know whichever way it is *T*-1
175947:14	I know exactly where that is *T*-1 . E_S
176023:11	this is how I discovered , you know , \[ the que- , \+ the Prime Minister 's , you know , question \] and answer period *T*-1 , you know . E_S
176074:16	I 'm not sure how old you are *T*-1 . E_S
176186:27	we sort of take care of the kids when they were school *T*-1
176223:53	in our particular situation , I 'm a much better mother when I work out of the home *T*-1
176232:16	and that is sometimes what some women who *T*-1 have *-2 to work ,
176364:42	Well , you know , but you made the comment *ICH*-1 earlier , why would someone be interested in children *T*-2 . E_S
176495:20	did you do *T*-1 when your kids were growing up *T*-2
176514:33	I could n't stand how she was taking care of my child *T*-1
176519:7	So when my son stayed over there *T*-1 , he got sick . E_S
176599:60	and I 've got some very definite , uh , opinions about it *ICH*-1 . Uh , you know , which *T*-2 have n't changed all that much from my first reactions \[ from , \+ from \] \[ when they , \+ when they \] announced it *T*-3 . But , uh , developed a little more , I guess , but have n't changed that much . E_S
176617:66	\[ it , \+ you know , uh , like , there \] was an incident *ICH*-1 several years ago where an Amtrak engineer MUMBLEx you know
176700:156	*T*-3 to determine exactly \[ what the , \+ what the \] things are *T*-4
176749:52	\[ \[ we do n't , \+ we , \] \+ we were n't \] sure how * to do that *T*-1 E_S
176811:47	\[ A- , \+ and \] \[ you knew how , \+ you knew how \] * to do the framing *T*-1 ? E_S
176813:21	Uh , well my dad knew how * to do most of it *T*-1 , you know . E_S
176962:39	it was n't , uh , cheaper where you are *T*-1
176967:17	It probably comes from where you are *T*-1 . E_S
176992:30	\[ And , \+ but \] that was just when I was a kid *T*-1 E_S
176993:21	so I do n't really know what the cost of living is even like *T*-1 in Dallas anymore . E_S
177033:54	you wonder , uh , had the jury been a different group of people what *T*-1 would have happened with that outcome
177034:133	all of us witnessed what we did *T*-2 with the video tape beating
177081:16	Uh , I understand why they were upset *-2 by the verdict *T*-3 just because even those of us that *T*-1 are n't black or , uh , do n't live there or whatever , we all saw the same thing \[ on the , \+ on the \] tape E_S
177098:61	*-2 to determine , you know , \[ how you address , \+ how you weigh , \] you know , Rodney \[ getting , \+ getting \] the hell beat *-1 out of him against , you know , forty deaths *T*-3
177104:40	I 'm not \[ su- , \+ exactly sure , \] uh , what the circumstances surrounding the deaths . N_S
177148:11	You know how capital gang , they always say well inside the beltway , they think thus *T*-1 E_S
177261:104	they 're pretty miserable where they are *T*-1
177290:100	*T*-2 know how it is *T*-3 someplace else
177405:132	\[ people \[ would be , \+ would get \] \[ very , \+ very , \] \+ you know , they 'd be very \] careful about how they bought stuff *T*-1
177489:29	I mean I started *-1 doing this when I was about thirty-five *T*-2 E_S
177511:57	and , uh , \[ it , \+ it \] creates a problem , uh , you know , when you 're on the road *T*-1 . E_S
177668:91	my wife 's father owned *T*-1 when he was alive *T*-2
