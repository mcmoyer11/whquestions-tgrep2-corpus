839:10	###SpeakerA77 . ###Well , I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###SpeakerA79 . ###Why do we end this thing *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###\[ It used * to , \+ it used *-1 to \] just automatically cut off E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###I think 0 it just says * hang up . E_S ###SpeakerB82 .

E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Why do n't we do that *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB84 .

853:4	###SpeakerB84 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Good-bye Sharon . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Good * talking to you Archie . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , the first thing for me is \[ I wonder , \+ I see \] a couple of different ways of * talking about what privacy is *T*-1 , ###um , if \[ privacy is something that *T*-2 disturbs your private state , \+ I mean an invasion of privacy is something that *T*-3 disturbs your private state , \] E_S that 's one thing , E_S ###and if privacy is something that *T*-1 comes into your private state and extracts information from it , in other words , finds something *ICH*-2 out about you that 's another . E_S 
861:80	###um , if \[ privacy is something that *T*-2 disturbs your private state , \+ I mean an invasion of privacy is something that *T*-3 disturbs your private state , \] E_S that 's one thing , E_S ###and if privacy is something that *T*-1 comes into your private state and extracts information from it , in other words , finds something *ICH*-2 out about you that 's another . E_S ###And \[ the first kind of invasion of , \+ the first type of privacy \] seemed *T*-2 invaded *-1 to me , and very much everyday in this country , E_S ###but in the second time , at least overtly , uh , where someone comes in and , uh , finds out information about you that *T*-1 should be private *T*-2 , uh , does not seem , uh , um , obviously , everyday . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I agree with that . E_S ###I think 0 in a good example on the typical thing that *T*-1 happens , uh , when the phone rang *T*-2 E_S and it 's T I 0 *T*-3 calling , E_S my immediate reaction is that it 's some sort of strange phone message E_S ###and then I realize , oh , no , this is something 0 I solicited *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###That 's right . E_S 
865:34	###SpeakerB2 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I agree with that . E_S ###I think 0 in a good example on the typical thing that *T*-1 happens , uh , when the phone rang *T*-2 E_S and it 's T I 0 *T*-3 calling , E_S my immediate reaction is that it 's some sort of strange phone message E_S ###and then I realize , oh , no , this is something 0 I solicited *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion E_S ###but after that I realized , no , \[ I , \+ I \] really wanted this E_S ###and it was sort of exciting E_S 
868:55	###and then I realize , oh , no , this is something 0 I solicited *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion E_S ###but after that I realized , no , \[ I , \+ I \] really wanted this E_S ###and it was sort of exciting E_S ###and so , that was almost an example of \[ s- , \+ \] an invasion that *T*-1 turns out *-2 to be not invasive . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
885:97	###SpeakerA9 . ###\[ From , \+ from \] personal parties or from these , um , \[ phone answer , \+ phone , uh , commercial \] things . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Commercial , \[ sol- , \+ solicitations \] primarily . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###SpeakerA13 . ###Oh , \[ that , \+ that 's \] a remarkable number . E_S ###I get them rarely E_S ###and I 'm still astounded \[ that , \+ that \] one , they let anyone do them and two , that they have any effect in this whatsoever . E_S 
896:66	###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###I think 0 they prey on people 's , um , inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine . E_S ###I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has *T*-1 0 *-3 to say *T*-2 , E_S ###and then they feel an obligation *-1 to respond even though there 's not even a person there . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems *-2 to be little control E_S ###and \[ you , \+ one 's \] feeling obligated , because of some sense \[ of , \+ of \] the way 0 the ritual is played *-1 out *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
901:45	###and then they feel an obligation *-1 to respond even though there 's not even a person there . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems *-2 to be little control E_S ###and \[ you , \+ one 's \] feeling obligated , because of some sense \[ of , \+ of \] the way 0 the ritual is played *-1 out *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S 
904:24	###and \[ you , \+ one 's \] feeling obligated , because of some sense \[ of , \+ of \] the way 0 the ritual is played *-1 out *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###\[ And , \+ and , \] uh , \[ that , \+ that \] then ends up *-1 being \[ the , \+ the \] most common example for me . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
926:17	###and , I mean , you know , the classic , oh , I do n't know C I A conspiracy theories or whatever , would have such parties *-1 trying *-2 to do it without your knowledge . E_S ###So there 's , , things that *T*-1 invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them *T*-2 and possibly things that *T*-3 invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it , E_S ###and I ca n't talk about the second one other than * \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] generate paranoia . E_S ###It 's a surmise E_S ###and , I 'd like *-1 to think that it 's quite low , at least in this country . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###* \[ To , \+ to \] surmise . It is there . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###I do n't think 0 I 'd like the K G B \[ is \+ \] monitoring my phone or anything like that . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . 
928:47	###and I ca n't talk about the second one other than * \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] generate paranoia .

E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###I do n't think 0 I 'd like the K G B \[ is \+ \] monitoring my phone or anything like that . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Well , I guess , 0 although , \[ I , \+ \] well , that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is *T*-1 *T*-3 *T*-2 , because , uh , if that 's the case of a tree falling in the forest E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
937:61	###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###and I 'm not feeling invaded ###then maybe my privacy has n't been *?* because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh , if you 're defining it in terms of information gone even if it 's something 0 you do n't know *T*-1 about it , well , then I guess 0 one could assume 0 one was invaded *-2 E_S 
937:75	###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###and I 'm not feeling invaded ###then maybe my privacy has n't been *?* because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh , if you 're defining it in terms of information gone even if it 's something 0 you do n't know *T*-1 about it , well , then I guess 0 one could assume 0 one was invaded *-2 E_S 
937:88	###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah .

984:32	###SpeakerB46 . ###That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high *T*-1 because I would find that there be , \[ cou- , \+ \] a good possibly that their facts \[ were , \+ were \] fantasy . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information \[ from a , \+ \] that I would rather 0 they did n't *T*-1 E_S ###and that might be the sense of the spending pattern *ICH*-2 , for instance , \[ that , \+ that \] I would have thought *T*-1 to be private . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh , uh-huh . E_S 
986:20	###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###But then if it turns out *-1 to generate incorrect things , that 's even worse E_S 
1008:13	###and then all of , a sudden you get your thirty a week because now , they 're advertising you . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Right . E_S ###Exactly . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . 
1020:68	###I mean , they said 0 they would give it out to only select companies E_S but , um , you know , just like software is only given *-1 out to customers , E_S ###I mean , you ca n't believe that .

E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . ###So \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's ver- , \] \+ it 's \] interesting , E_S ###here again \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] casual reading E_S ###and it 's not eaten up with a lot of , uh , mechanical stuff E_S 
2364:61	###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . ###So \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's ver- , \] \+ it 's \] interesting , E_S ###here again \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] casual reading E_S ###and it 's not eaten up with a lot of , uh , mechanical stuff E_S ###and it 's really excellent fast reading E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , but \] as you say \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \+ sometimes it *EXP*-1 's \] difficult * \[ to , \+ to \] know if it 's , you know , N_S ###I think 0 if somebody would say hey , * read these ten books because these are self-improvements , I would probably be turned *-1 off to them . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah , E_S 
2392:92	###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###In quality , especially now days , uh , that 's almost everything that *T*-1 comes across \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] airways MUMBLEx .

E_S ###SpeakerA57 . 
2405:130	###I think 0 it 's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] all that kind of rolls in together there , E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###but , uh , that 's just kind of part of it . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Okay , E_S ###well , any other comments . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
2437:7	###and it varies like every day . I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###SpeakerA3 . ###It 's pretty bad , E_S ###but it 's true , you know , E_S ###they tend *-1 to try *-2 to be , you know , real lax E_S ###and supposedly the policy is like , you know , \[ we , \+ you know , we , \] hire these wonderful creative people E_S ###and we do n't want *-1 to smush their creativity , you know .

2488:5	###We had them in the warehouse , E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh .

3384:58	###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###SpeakerA83 . ###Well , for example , I used *-1 to like old Phil Collins . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###An old , Genesis ? E_S ###SpeakerB86 .

4069:11	###It came on after DOCTOR WHO , on Saturday nights , here at least . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . ###Uh-huh .

4094:16	###What kind of work do you do *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###I 'm a Payroll Clerk . E_S ###Just an accounting clerk . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###At T I ? E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###No , uh , E_S ###I have a friend who *T*-1 works for T I E_S ###and I work for a tire service , here in , N_S

4111:18	###and I just wondered . E_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###it could be 0 T I -ers , I think 0 *T*-1 , probably are participating more than anybody else , E_S ###but I needed the money . E_S ###This is five bucks here . E_S ###SpeakerA88 . ###I think 0 that 's something 0 we all ca- , N_S ###SpeakerB89 . 
4134:4	###oh we 're not even supposed *-1 to be talking about this though , are we *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerA94 . ###I guess not . E_S ###SpeakerB95 . ###SpeakerA96 . ###How did I hear about it *T*-1 ? E_S ###Well I work , you know , N_S ###they are gathering a data base for voice processing . E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
4140:4	###Well I work , you know , N_S ###they are gathering a data base for voice processing . E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###And , that 's my field of work also . E_S ###SpeakerB99 . ###Oh ! E_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###So \[ I , \+ I \] know the people at T I who *T*-1 are doing this E_S 
4150:42	###and I heard about it , E_S ###so I called them and asked if I could participate . And , uh , You know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth . E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###SpeakerB103 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###We could go back to television shows . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . 
4174:35	###SpeakerB111 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA112 . ###Well , for example . In Greek there are seven different words for love . E_S ###SpeakerB113 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA114 . ###Okay , E_S ###so you can have , N_S ###there 's one word for love of your brother , one word for love of your wife , one word for , you know , uh , love of your father , and that sort of thing . E_S 
4185:66	###SpeakerB115 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA116 . ###So that 's , you know , N_S ###you can look at it as though they are saying 0 it 's not true , E_S ###but there 's too much historical fact involved * just from \[ the \+ uh , the \] histories that *T*-1 \[ are , \+ were \] developed *-2 around that time , that *T*-3 are available . * To deny that , at least the majority of it is true .

4195:28	###SpeakerB119 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA120 . ###You can look at it , you know , N_S ###if you want *-1 to say that it *EXP*-2 's proven that it is n't true , then you can very much look at it that way . E_S ###SpeakerB121 . ###I guess 0 if you 're looking for that , you 're , N_S ###SpeakerA122 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , Well , you can interpret \[ that the , \+ \[ what \+ \] the \] T V show , in the same way that you can interpret the Bible *T*-1 . E_S 
4216:76	###SpeakerB129 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA130 . ###But , uh , I do n't know if \[ there is , \+ there is \] a time limit on this , ###so , uh . N_S ###SpeakerB131 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA132 . ###SpeakerB133 . 
4243:12	###SpeakerB2 . ###We , uh , N_S ###well , uh , \[ my , \+ my \] husband is right now teaching an aerobics class . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB6 . 
4255:5	###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###You 're a student ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so . \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] an avid aerobics , uh , person and just very , very athletic .

4310:37	###So , um , and I feel that way too as far as , you know , * just sitting and \[ doing , \+ you know , \[ to , \+ \] the idea of * doing \] fifty sit-ups or something , you know , E_S ###* to , N_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh .

4323:81	###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###Is that why you like aerobics classes *T*-1 , because \[ you 're not , sort of , \+ \] someone else is doing the counting for you , so , it makes it less of a chore ? E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah . E_S 
4331:10	###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . ###And , it 's got , N_S ###and I 've always enjoyed dance . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###So it involves , you know , N_S 
4403:16	###SpeakerA59 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Well , you 're talking to someone from California where it 's often swimming weather *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Oh , E_S ###I did n't realize that . E_S ###SpeakerA63 .

E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###So , there must be something to some of them . E_S ###And , uh , N_S 
4449:19	###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###So , there must be something to some of them . E_S ###And , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Well , I think 0 people \[ are , \+ are \] more inc- , um , um , N_S ###people from California seem *-1 to be more health motivated all around .

4477:96	###SpeakerB86 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###\[ and , \+ and , \] it does n't deal with just exercise , or just stress management , or just diet , or anything . E_S ###\[ It , \+ it 's \] on fairly \[ so- , \+ solid \] scientific ground . E_S ###Uh , it 's just dispensed *-1 with these distinctions . E_S ###It says 0 \[ ever- , \+ \] all sorts of factors go into health and 0 there 's no reason 0 * to talk about one rather than another *T*-1 , so that \[ they , \+ they \] combined them all together . E_S ###\[ And , \+ uh , so \] it 's had that orientation for quite some time . E_S ###Um , there 's been some progressive medical schools *EXP*-1 out here , that *T*-2 have taken that approach . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . 
4502:30	###\[ They sort of , dev- , \+ you know , each developed \] a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more , and a little bit more . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah , E_S ###the more money 0 they put *T*-1 into it . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###I can see that . E_S ###And , cause , I , N_S 
4531:36	###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###and , before long , \[ you , \+ you \] get \[ this , \+ this \] whole kind of Gestalt , this whole package \[ \[ of , \+ of \] health , \+ of health \] care and options E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###\[ and , \+ uh , and \] exercise \[ is , \+ is \] strongly considered *-1 one of them . E_S ###The irony \[ is , \+ is \] 0 it 's people in the cities , in my experience , that *T*-1 are most oriented towards *-2 doing the exercise . E_S ###And , I guess because they spend all day in back of their desks . E_S 
4576:29	###and they do n't do very much vigorous exercise at all . E_S ###But , they do a lot of low keyed , low impact , low stress exercise , E_S ###and they combine it with a , you know , meditation or whatever . Some sort of relaxation E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###and , they seem pretty , you know , N_S ###they do n't have the hard body . E_S ###They do n't have that perfect look , E_S ###and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious . E_S

6054:34	###SpeakerB196 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA197 . ###SpeakerB198 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA199 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB200 . ###SpeakerA201 . ###MUMBLEx for example , you test a chip . E_S 
6078:15	###They buy \[ all , \+ all \] the things that I B M throws *T*-1 away E_S ###\[ and they MUMBLEx , \+ and that 's \] why they 're so compatible *T*-1 .

6100:10	###SpeakerB212 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerA213 . ###And I want more , you know . E_S ###And it 's like Jesus Christ , you know , N_S ###it 's like why do you want more *T*-1 . E_S ###Because it 's like one second of recording . E_S ###I mean you put into Wave E_S ###SpeakerB214 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
6106:14	###Because it 's like one second of recording . E_S ###I mean you put into Wave E_S ###SpeakerB214 . ###Uh-huh .

6122:26	###SpeakerB216 . ###It 's amazing . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA217 . ###It 's like , Jesus Christ .

E_S ###SpeakerA219 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S 
6129:40	###SpeakerA219 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB220 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ Both , \+ both \] in terms in Ram as well as , uh , you know , standard memory or \[ disk mem- , \+ disk base , \] E_S ###SpeakerA221 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB222 . ###so . N_S 
6180:9	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , personally , you know , I think , you know , N_S ###of course I 'm sure 0 we 're familiar with the exact same benefit package E_S ###and I think that , uh , we 've probably got one of the best around , you know , E_S ###besides , they tend *-1 to offer \[ ad- , \+ adequate \] vacation , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###And the paid time off is wonderful , E_S ###and , uh , one of the things that we were just talking about *T*-1 as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that *T*-2 is offered *-3 E_S ###and I think 0 that is just \[ a , \+ a \] fabulous one , E_S ###so . I do n't know if you participate in that or not , E_S ###but N_S 
6195:61	###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , I have *-1 to agree with that . E_S ###You know , I was thinking about , uh , importance of benefits and that kind of thing , other than salary while I was waiting for , uh , the system to find \[ a , \+ a \] respondent . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###And I started *-1 thinking that over the years that importance has changed E_S 
6210:5	###But as I grow older and my family grows , \[ it , \+ the medical benefits \] are more important E_S ###and the retirement is more important . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###I had never really thought of it that way E_S ###but \[ I guess 0 that 's true , \+ ###I guess 0 that 's true . \] E_S ###I 'm still young enough \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , the vacation 's real important to me E_S ###and the paid time off *ICH*-1 is real important to me \[ and , \+ and \] that kind of thing . E_S ###But , uh , you know , \[ I was just , \+ as a matter of fact , I just , \] uh , celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and , uh , kind of started *-1 looking through \[ the , \+ the \] book because of that , you know , E_S ###now that I 'm a hundred percent vested *-1 , you know , you kind of look through the book and see well , \[ what exactly , \+ what \] does that mean *T*-2 and what is the pension all about *T*-3 E_S 
6220:90	###and , you know , \[ when you 're , \+ when you 're , \] you know , in your , N_S ###I 'm only in my late twenties now , E_S ###so you tend *-1 not to think about retirement . E_S ###But , uh , it 's , N_S ###I guess 0 now is the time 0 * to think about it *T*-1 , E_S ###so . Does T I have a pretty good retirement package , do you think ? E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###I think 0 they have , uh , \[ a- , \+ one \] that we need *-3 to recognize that we 're going *-1 to have *-2 to supplement *T*-4 ourselves . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S 
6220:111	###and , you know , \[ when you 're , \+ when you 're , \] you know , in your , N_S ###I 'm only in my late twenties now , E_S ###so you tend *-1 not to think about retirement .

E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###So , uh , what *T*-1 happens is 0 you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###And then the tuition is also the same thing . E_S 
8518:14	###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###And then the tuition is also the same thing . E_S ###So , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] basically that I spend , like , maybe thirty-five , forty dollars every two weeks \[ on , \+ on \] groceries E_S ###and that 's about it . E_S ###But the thing , uh , also is that , you know , like if you want *-1 to go out like if you want *-2 to go to a restaurant or something , then I have *-3 to moderate that because it 's like I ca n't go *-4 eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars , um , you know , three times a week . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###No , E_S ###you ca n't do that very often . E_S 
8532:36	###SpeakerB10 . ###\[ Are , \+ are \] you working anywhere while you are going to school ? E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Because , um , they do n't allow me to work since , uh , I 'm a foreign student . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh , okay . E_S 
8552:6	###SpeakerA19 . ###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , \[ I ba- , \+ I basically \] know how much I have *T*-1 , right ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And so , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that \[ I , \+ I \] can tell like , uh , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] get all my money out of the teller . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . 
8552:26	###SpeakerA19 . ###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , \[ I ba- , \+ I basically \] know how much I have *T*-1 , right ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And so , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that \[ I , \+ I \] can tell like , uh , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] get all my money out of the teller . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . 
8554:73	###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And so , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that \[ I , \+ I \] can tell like , uh , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] get all my money out of the teller . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have *-1 to call , you know , international . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
8565:4	###SpeakerA25 . ###Argentina . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Argentina ? E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###And so the bas- , N_S 
8597:4	###SpeakerA37 . ###\[ Any , \+ any , \] um , N_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###basically the United States is the cheapest country 0 * to call out of *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###And , um , because it 's considered *-1 a luxury in other countries . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
8633:23	###SpeakerA51 . ###I 'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###And what do you think 0 you 'll do *T*-1 with that ? E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###With those degrees ? E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Well , \[ I can , \+ I can \] work \[ up , \+ um , here up \] to a year . E_S 
8637:6	###SpeakerA53 . ###With those degrees ? E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Well , \[ I can , \+ I can \] work \[ up , \+ um , here up \] to a year . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###And ? E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###And hopefully * get a job after that . E_S 
8650:6	###SpeakerA59 . ###Um , computer communications and data transmissions . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Oh , okay , E_S ###so you want *-1 to find a , uh , data transmissions , N_S ###you 're looking for , uh , um , long distance type stuff . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###SpeakerA63 . 
8684:47	###SpeakerA71 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###and , uh , * do that \[ on a , \+ on a \] full time basis here in town . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###\[ And so , \+ and \] you have a monthly budget ? E_S ###SpeakerB76 . 
8697:46	###SpeakerA77 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###and we know what bills *T*-1 have *-2 to be paid *-3 , E_S ###and , uh , we pay as many of those bills that *T*-1 can be paid *-2 \[ with , \+ with \] the monthly budget , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###So , you do n't have any problem in , um , * overcharging on your credit card , and stuff like that . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh sure . E_S 
8701:13	###and , uh , we pay as many of those bills that *T*-1 can be paid *-2 \[ with , \+ with \] the monthly budget , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###So , you do n't have any problem in , um , * overcharging on your credit card , and stuff like that . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh sure . E_S ###We 're like everybody else , you know , E_S ###we 've got \[ a , \+ several \] credit cards that sometimes , um , instead of *-1 paying *T*-2 them all off every month maybe you have *-1 to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S 
8714:21	###SpeakerA83 . ###Well then , uh , see , uh , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] one of the points which I do n't see *T*-1 , E_S ###like \[ I , \+ I \] do n't give a lot of gifts during Christmas E_S ###and \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't wa- , \+ I do n't like \] *-1 to give any at all E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###because the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , you know , it 's like if I want something \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] ask somebody , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S 
8716:65	###like \[ I , \+ I \] do n't give a lot of gifts during Christmas E_S ###and \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't wa- , \+ I do n't like \] *-1 to give any at all E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###because the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , you know , it 's like if I want something \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] ask somebody , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###like , like , uh , \[ for Chr- , \+ uh , for Christmas \] my roommate goes , what do you want *T*-1 . E_S 
8726:59	###And I said , I want a backpack . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###You kno- , no , E_S ###I told him \[ yo- , \+ \] if you want *-1 to give me a present for Christmas * give me a backpack . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's something that you can use *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . 
8757:34	###\[ it was , \+ to me it was \] ridiculous , E_S because you know , you have *-2 to , N_S ###once a year you go out E_S ###and you spend all this money on all these people , E_S ###and some you do n't care about *T*-1 , you know , E_S ###it 's like , N_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###That 's true , E_S ###why bother . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Yeah . E_S 
8783:12	###SpeakerA109 . ###Well , for example , we had spring break now , E_S ###and I went *-1 skiing E_S ###and I spent around like , maybe , two hundred dollars . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###I expect so . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###\[ So , \+ uh , but \] you know , it 's like , um . N_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###You 've got *-1 to budget that though . E_S 
8806:19	###SpeakerB118 . ###Right , MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###And if I felt like I spent way to much then , um , I wo n't go out , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###and so , like my roommate went home , E_S ###I went *-1 skiing \[ in , \+ over \] the Carolina Mountains which *T*-2 are n't anything , E_S ###SpeakerB122 . 
8815:44	###SpeakerB122 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###\[ but , \+ um , but \] \[ \[ it was , \+ you know , it was , \] \+ I guess 0 it was \] worth it , E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###Sure it is *?* , E_S ###any time 0 you can get away , \[ and , \+ and , \] get away \[ from , \+ from \] the daily grind *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###You know , it was a nice place . E_S ###Yeah , E_S 
8835:30	###six minutes and a half . E_S ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Is that okay ? E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###All right . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###All right . E_S 
8858:34	###And that , oh , I guess , ranges anywhere from , uh , carpentry work to , um , um , some types of furniture and , um , oh , I do n't know what you would call them *T*-1 , knickknacks , I guess , stuff 0 you hang *T*-2 on the wall *-3 to put a mirror on *T*-2 E_S ###and I made some , um , candle sconces that you hang *T*-1 on the ... N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I have quite a few of those that my uncle made *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###There 's something about * working with wood \[ that , \+ that \] I enjoy *T*-1 , that , N_S ###I do n't know if it 's the saw dust or the mess 0 you make *T*-1 or the smell of the wood E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
8874:58	###and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that , E_S ###but then , I get the opportunity *-1 to vacuum , E_S ###so I guess 0 I get some of both . E_S ###What *T*-1 are some of your things 0 you like *-2 to do *T*-3 ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , when I have time *T*-1 I do like *-2 to sew , E_S ###um , I had been doing a lot of crocheting . E_S ###I make a lot of afghans or used *-1 to make a lot of them . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S 
8878:4	###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , when I have time *T*-1 I do like *-2 to sew , E_S ###um , I had been doing a lot of crocheting . E_S ###I make a lot of afghans or used *-1 to make a lot of them . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###My mother was real heavy into crafts , E_S ###and I would help her with whatever she happened *-1 to be doing *T*-2 , E_S ###and then , she would go to these , uh , arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework . E_S 
8880:10	###um , I had been doing a lot of crocheting . E_S ###I make a lot of afghans or used *-1 to make a lot of them . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###My mother was real heavy into crafts , E_S ###and I would help her with whatever she happened *-1 to be doing *T*-2 , E_S ###and then , she would go to these , uh , arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S 
8887:22	###and then , she would go to these , uh , arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###So , a lot of times I 'd help her with that . E_S ###I have n't had much opportunity *-1 to work on any other craft stuff lately E_S ###we 've been trying *-1 to start up a business and then trying *-1 to get my garden going . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's a good time for gardening . E_S 
8916:21	###She enjoys *-1 doing it during the cold weather because she 's always got something 0 * to cover \[ her , \+ her \] legs and feet with *T*-2 while she is working on it . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###I know 0 it seems like , she , N_S ###I think 0 she made three *ICH*-1 this year one for , uh , my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters . E_S ###So , those things they take some time 0 * to make *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I found one that *T*-1 's real easy , E_S 
8948:21	###\[ I , \+ I , \] N_S ###first thing that *T*-1 comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across , you know , back and forth until she winds up with this big piece \[ of , \+ of \] afghan . E_S ###I guess 0 that is your standard knitting , is n't it *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###Usually single crochet \[ \[ \[ would , \+ is , \] \+ is \] \+ always starts \] it off . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I know , E_S 
8981:48	###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###What , N_S ###have you started your garden yet ? E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yes . E_S ###We planted , um , potatoes and onions and bell peppers . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Um , boy . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
8992:10	###and jalapeno peppers . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###* always got *-1 to have those . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###I think 0 I had four , uh , jalapeno plants last year . E_S ###I think 0 one of them died , E_S ###but \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I 've got , s- , \] \+ I 've put them , \] \+ I chop them up and put them \] in jars and usually give them away because \[ I , \+ there is no way that I \] can eat all of those *T*-1 E_S 
9021:18	###It seems like all 0 I got *T*-1 was , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Supposedly after the soil warms up . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###I would think so , um , E_S ###* seems like \[ these all , \+ they all \] went \[ to , \+ uh , to \] leaf , E_S ###and it was n't until late in the summer 0 they started *-1 making fruit *T*-2 . E_S ###So , I do n't know if I , N_S ###Mom would say 0 you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon . You know , E_S ###SpeakerB54 . 
9034:62	###SpeakerB56 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] doubt if zucchini is in there . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###It may not be *?* , E_S ###it may not be *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Probably the same time 0 \[ the , \+ the \] other squash is *T*-1 though . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###You think 0 they 're later in the year ? E_S ###SpeakerB60 . 
9066:7	###that would be fine . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Oh , just any time . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Well , all right . E_S ###I guess 0 we 'll call this one quits E_S ###\[ an , \+ and \] thanks for * participating . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###All right . E_S ###Well , I 've enjoyed *-1 talking to you . E_S 
9086:41	###SpeakerB2 . ###Um , gee , E_S ###I do n't ###, I mean , N_S \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 it 's the stuff that *T*-1 comes out of automobile exhaust , you know , E_S ###they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###So , I believe them E_S ###but I 'm not a chemist . E_S 
9111:148	###SpeakerA11 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###it just looked liked peanut butter . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###My word . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Thick and brown and so on . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###And that was , a few years ago ? E_S 
9154:148	###SpeakerB28 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###I mean that 's such a spectacle . E_S ###It *EXP*-1 would be a shame * to ruin it . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S 
9166:9	###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ uh , I do n't \] know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals . ###Uh , maybe just take good care of our cars , and make * sure 0 we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###apart from that , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what we can do *T*-1 as individuals . E_S ###What do you think 0 we can do *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA37 . 
9174:42	###What do you think 0 we can do *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###you think , 0 it 's \[ more , \+ more \] to society . E_S ###Well I guess 0 I kind of agree there . E_S ###I , uh , N_S ###on an individual basis there is n't a lot 0 we can do *T*-1 about a lot of things E_S ###but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can , uh , force , uh , government , uh , that we elect *T*-1 to deal more seriously with it . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S 
9175:4	###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###you think , 0 it 's \[ more , \+ more \] to society . E_S ###Well I guess 0 I kind of agree there . E_S ###I , uh , N_S ###on an individual basis there is n't a lot 0 we can do *T*-1 about a lot of things E_S ###but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can , uh , force , uh , government , uh , that we elect *T*-1 to deal more seriously with it . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
9205:16	###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess 0 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] to the point where I 'm cynical enough that I really do n't believe 0 anything will happen \[ unless , \+ unless \] there 's something economically justifiable about it *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###And in the case of air pollution , it simply might turn out at some point down the road , *-1 to be so costly *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 * to have *-3 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems , and everything else that we 'll spend the money that *T*-6 's necessary * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get rid *-2 of the source of it . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
9208:49	###SpeakerA45 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###And in the case of air pollution , it simply might turn out at some point down the road , *-1 to be so costly *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 * to have *-3 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems , and everything else that we 'll spend the money that *T*-6 's necessary * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get rid *-2 of the source of it . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###I suspect \[ that the pub- , \+ \] that there 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be a lot of pressure , uh , come * to bear on the companies that *T*-4 deal with it E_S ###and probably the only way 0 that can happen *T*-1 is for , um , governments to realize that they have *-2 to pay if companies do n't . E_S 
9222:25	###SpeakerB52 . ###People also have *-1 to realize 0 they ca n't have their cake and eat it . E_S ###So , if you do n't want *-1 to burn coal for power , how about \[ nucle- , \+ nuclear \] energy . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Well we do n't want that either . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Exactly , E_S ###yeah , E_S 
9263:22	###Um , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###do you have any air pollution in your area ? E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###There 's not really a lot here in Raleigh . E_S ###Uh , once in a while we 'll get some , uh , E_S ###I think 0 it kind of washes down \[ from , \+ uh , from \] your area Linda . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . 
9276:35	###SpeakerA71 . ###You 're talking about \[ from , \+ from \] \[ the , \+ uh , the \] \[ middle , \+ middle \] states , \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 have more factories and so on . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###that 's what they say *T*-1 E_S ###but \[ \[ it 's \+ it 's not , \] \+ it 's not \] very usual E_S 
9285:11	###but \[ \[ it 's \+ it 's not , \] \+ it 's not \] very usual E_S ###and certainly we do n't have the eye stinging variety that you get *T*-1 in the big cities . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we really do n't have that either . E_S ###\[ Although I think 0 I can tell a difference in , \+ ###I lived in this area for about twenty-five years ###and I think 0 I can tell a difference in \] the comfort level , uh , particularly in the summer . Uh , you know , when it gets hot *T*-1 , and you have , \[ the , \+ that \] kind of a pressure from the pockets of air , uh , usually they say caused * by exhaust *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh-huh , E_S 
9293:80	###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###It seems to me that I 'm more uncomfortable E_S ###and , you know , my eyes sting more and so on and so on . E_S ###So I suspect that \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] an ever growing problem . E_S 
9398:62	###and then we got used to it E_S ###and then we went up to Dallas E_S ###and it was just , N_S ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \[ not , \+ not \] that it 's just hot or dry , E_S ###it 's just not very comfortable , E_S ###it just , N_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Her- , N_S ###do \[ you , \+ you \] think 0 San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
9438:39	###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###I mean , that 's really bad . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , I mean , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 I 've been in some places , you know , where the weather was just so mild *T*-1 , you know , places like Monterey , California or , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S 
9445:91	###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###just , you know , so mild , E_S ###and then you 've been to such extremes like San Angelo , Texas \[ where you just , \+ where you walk \] outside *T*-1 and you sweat *T*-1 , E_S ###you know you 're sweating , E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . 
9451:61	###you know you 're sweating , E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###you look down at your arm , E_S ###but you see the water leaving your arm , E_S ###it 's so hot , 0 you just feel it pulling away , ###bizarre . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Oh wow , uh . E_S 
9464:103	###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh it does n't , N_S ###some people say , uh , 0 \[ they , \+ they \] like *-1 to watch the changing of the seasons E_S ###but , uh , I 'd rather , you know , like southern California , you know , have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###So , it 's kind of a luxury . E_S 
9523:22	###SpeakerB6 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###and \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] always liked that show probably the very best . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###I 'm certainly acquainted with \[ the character \+ the characters . \] E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
9546:22	###MCGYVER , because \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] only one person there , \[ more than , \+ \] uh , you know , instead of a cast of people , E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh .

9551:50	###and all of a sudden he 's got a hang glider E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###I do n't think 0 \[ I , \+ I 've \] even heard of that show . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###You have n't *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###It 's called *-1 MCGYVER ? E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Some of the little things , E_S 
9617:49	###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah .

11102:4	###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well we have those *RNR*-2 , uh , which I think 0 *T*-1 is one of the best things is those *RNR*-2 cash for cans . E_S ###I do n't know if you all have those things around . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they 're in almost every shopping center , E_S 
11107:28	###I do n't know if you all have those things around . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yes .

11135:39	###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###At work we started , uh , all the recycling stuff .

11141:15	###SpeakerA35 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###And , uh , that really , started a lot of stuff off , E_S ###but , you know sometimes it dwindles down .

11252:68	###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah , E_S ###the ones at the grocery store , half the time , they 've pulled the lid off E_S ###so you ca n't use it anyway . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Right , E_S

11335:64	###SpeakerA105 . ###Uh-huh .

11532:7	###SpeakerB28 . ###I think 0 the last movie that we went out *-1 to see *T*-2 was DANCES WITH WOLVES . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Oh , I saw it . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Good , E_S ###we 've both seen one . E_S ###Did you cry through it ? E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yes , E_S

11649:19	###you could follow \[ this , \+ this \] beaten down path , E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing .

E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###Uh , have you seen any of the behind the scenes , uh , \[ of , \+ of \] that movie . E_S 
11677:35	###SpeakerB82 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###That 's the , part 0 they had trouble *-1 finding *T*-2 was wolves . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###I guess 0 they 're just not domesticated , E_S ###\[ or , \+ or , \] N_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah , E_S ###what , N_S 
11735:46	###SpeakerB3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###uh , * look at them , E_S ###in England , Margaret Thatcher was prime minister , uh , ###Indira Ghandi , uh , in India , E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###so many , uh , women are heads of state E_S 
11790:16	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , it 's hard 0 * to say *T*-1 .

E_S ###What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Um , well , you talked about , uh , volcanos . E_S ###I 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are *T*-1 now , \[ and , \+ and \] what the amount of material that they do , uh , put *T*-2 into the atmosphere .

11793:91	###What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Um , well , you talked about , uh , volcanos .

14447:21	###SpeakerA59 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###So , anyway , I guess 0 we ca n't talk much more about that , E_S ###but I just thought 0 I 'd throw that in there . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###What . E_S ###Oh , okay , E_S ###maybe I 'll call you back \[ after , \+ after \] the recording is finished *-1 . E_S ###Actually I think 0 we have talked about football for five minutes . E_S 
14470:24	###so I guess 0 we should talk about football a little bit longer just *-1 to be sure 0 we got five minutes in . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###* Make * sure 0 we get our cash flow . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###So other than the Vikings , who do you like *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Um , actually , when I was younger *T*-1 , I was a Cardinal fan , too . E_S 
14478:20	###SpeakerB70 . ###Um , actually , when I was younger *T*-1 , I was a Cardinal fan , too . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh , oh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###* Remember Jim Hart ? E_S ###Jim Hart was playing . E_S ###Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals . E_S ###This was a long time ago . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . 
14480:15	###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh , oh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###* Remember Jim Hart ? E_S ###Jim Hart was playing . E_S ###Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals . E_S ###This was a long time ago . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . 
14491:22	###That 's about it , E_S ###I was always a Viking fan . E_S ###I think 0 I was into the Cardinals for a little bit E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Back when they were in Saint Louis *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Yes , E_S ###oh , of course . E_S 
14498:8	###SpeakerB76 . ###Yes , E_S ###oh , of course . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Since they 've been to Phoenix they have n't been , uh , all that impressive , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###I guess 0 I 've always been a Cowboy fan . E_S ###Other than that , I mean , you know , \[ when I 've , \+ you know , when you \] grow up in a city that *T*-1 has \[ the , \+ you know , one of the \] greatest football teams until the last few years *T*-2 , you kind of tend *-3 to get caught *-4 up in it . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , the Cowboys were \[ th- , \+ \] America 's football team , E_S 
14505:66	###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , the Cowboys were \[ th- , \+ \] America 's football team , E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###there 's no question about that , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S 
14516:67	###SpeakerB82 . ###SpeakerA83 . ###Because my parents would always have season tickets , E_S ###and they 'd go to all the games , E_S ###and you know , the hype were just unbelievable . E_S ###It 's just , you know , the last , oh N_S ###I guess 0 probably since about eighty-four , about eighty-five was when they started *-1 kind of going downhill really *T*-2 , E_S ###but , you know , I 'm just used to *-1 always growing up and hearing Cowboys , Cowboys , Cowboys , and , you know , Super Bowl , and all this other stuff . E_S ###So , I ca n't , you know , N_S ###I 'm not going *-1 to decide 0 I do n't like them just because they 're having a few bad years . E_S 
14523:39	###but , you know , I 'm just used to *-1 always growing up and hearing Cowboys , Cowboys , Cowboys , and , you know , Super Bowl , and all this other stuff . E_S ###So , I ca n't , you know , N_S ###I 'm not going *-1 to decide 0 I do n't like them just because they 're having a few bad years . E_S ###I mean , I think 0 they 'll pull out of it , E_S ###and , you know , \[ they 'll , \+ they 'll \] wind up *-1 being good again . E_S ###They 've got \[ some , \+ lot \] of really good young players \[ that *T*-1 are going *-2 to , \+ that *T*-3 are going *-4 to , \] uh , do pretty good , I think 0 *T*-5 . E_S ###But , they 're raising prices on their tickets . E_S ###So they 're banking on *-1 doing good next season . E_S ###I think 0 tickets are , N_S ###SpeakerB84 . 
14538:4	###thirty bucks or something ? E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Thirty , or thirty-two for really good tickets . E_S ###See , \[ they , \+ they \] sectioned it out even more . E_S ###They used *T*-1 to just have like , uh , N_S ###first of all it was all one price . E_S ###And then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else . E_S ###And now they 're sectioning it off \[ to \+ like \[ from the , \+ from one \] \] twenty yard line to the other one , E_S ###just on the lower levels is the highest price , E_S ###and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level , E_S 
14553:45	###SpeakerB88 . ###So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Um , you know , I 'm not sure , E_S ###I 'm not positive , E_S ###\[ I did n't , \+ I did n't \] really think about that . E_S ###I just remember *-1 trying *-2 to figure out where you could get N_S ###that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper . E_S ###But , not that I 'll ever go . E_S ###I had n't been to a Cowboys game , N_S 
14560:34	###that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper . E_S ###But , not that I 'll ever go . E_S ###I had n't been to a Cowboys game , N_S ###\[ las- , time , \+ last time \] 0 I went to the Cowboys game *T*-1 was during that , um , N F L strike , or \[ the , \+ when they had the \] scab \[ team , \+ teams \] in there *T*-2 , E_S ###and it was the , uh , Dallas and Washington Redskins game . E_S ###And I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets , because a lot of those doctors have season tickets , E_S ###and \[ they , \+ um , if they 're \] not going *-1 to use them they 'll give them to somebody else . E_S ###So \[ my dad , \+ I went with my dad \] to a game that one time . E_S ###But that was n't a real , you know , N_S ###\[ it was , \+ it was \] the scab teams , E_S

14615:4	###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh , I was visiting my son down in Dallas , E_S ###and . N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Oh , okay , E_S ###he works for T I . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###No , E_S ###no , E_S ###but his wife has a contract with T I , E_S 
14626:13	###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Oh , okay , E_S ###because I 'm down at N C State . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And so I took a class , E_S ###and he said , * sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
14662:15	###SpeakerA31 . ###Well , see the problem \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , what *T*-1 happens is \[ as , \+ \] that \[ you 're , \+ uh , you know , as you \] go from the country to a city , crime always increases , right ?

14677:8	###and they rush *-1 to get the same thing .

E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . 
14714:25	###I mean , they do n't want the money \[ so , \+ uh , so \] they can do something else with it . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###No , E_S ###they do n't want the money for food , E_S ###that 's for sure . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S ###and so . N_S ###SpeakerB50 .

18916:25	###I do n't know \[ if it 's , the , \+ if they 've done it \] citywide yet *ICH*-2 or not where they have the color coded , uh , bags and , uh , bins *T*-1 .

18949:40	###SpeakerB26 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###and they 're , uh , N_S ###one 's for white paper E_S ###and one 's for colored paper E_S ###so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so- , things like that goes in those boxes , E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
18979:34	###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh , I know it . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###We did have , uh , another novel , uh , experiment start this year . E_S ###Now we can put all our yard clippings out .

20121:21	###SpeakerB2 . ###At , N_S ###currently , I think 0 they are a little restrictive . Uh , particularly for , uh , certain ethnic groups or from certain countries .

E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , I 'm not real sure why I got this topic *T*-1 , because I do n't think 0 I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws .

20131:23	###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , we seem *-1 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] favor certain , uh , uh , countries particularly South American countries .

E_S ###Of course , that 's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern Europe , E_S 
20146:275	###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###I do not quite go along with that , E_S ###but . N_S ###SpeakerA13 . 
20177:123	###\[ They were all , \+ they were all \] born *-1 here E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh .

20186:77	###SpeakerA25 . ###Um .

E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Well , you know , um , back then what they tried *-2 to do *T*-1 , you know , N_S ###the MUMBLEx would always try *-1 to stump Jesus , try *-2 to give him something that *T*-3 would contradict himself , E_S 
20385:16	###And , of course , that 's when he said well you render unto Caesar 's what *T*-1 is Caesar 's *T*-2 , E_S ###you render unto God what *T*-1 is God 's . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right .

E_S ###And we 're going , oh , no , there goes our recycling place . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###That 's really nice 0 * to find *T*-1 out that it 's behind there . E_S ###Well , we pretty much do , um , plastic milk cartons and , um , um , um , newspapers . E_S ###I could n't even think of what you call them *T*-1 . E_S 
20809:22	###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah .

20820:14	###SpeakerA25 . ###And really , \[ that 's about , \+ that 's really about \] it . E_S ###Is there \[ anything , \+ any place \] else that *T*-1 really takes anything other than that , that you know of *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Well , I guess , um , 0 down \[ in , \+ kind of in \] North Dallas , there is a place that *T*-1 will take almost anything . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ we just do n't \] have the room 0 * to store all that much *T*-1 , you know , E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
20843:53	###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###you know . So I just go , you know , N_S ###we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen E_S ###and I 've just got three trash cans sitting in there , E_S you know , ###we just kind of dump things in each one , \[ if , \+ you know , if \] we get them , E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . 
20871:33	###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Some of our neighbors were doing it E_S ###and so , you know , when I found out some places 0 * to take it *T*-1 *T*-2 , N_S ###and , um , like , um , they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there , E_S ###and I know that they 're going *-1 to use , you know , the money for that *-2 to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing .

20879:22	###and , um , like , um , they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there , E_S ###and I know that they 're going *-1 to use , you know , the money for that *-2 to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing .

E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###so , you know , if I 'm not going *-1 to get the money for aluminum , I would just assume give it *ICH*-3 to the city of Flower Mound . 0 * to do something with *T*-2 , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . 
20915:37	###And , you know , we 're recycling aluminum cans *ICH*-3 up here \[ and , \+ \] uh , just what you would buy *T*-1 out of the machines and drink *-2 here E_S ###and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know , E_S ###and that 's , N_S ###they use the money from that *-1 to fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program . E_S ###It 's , N_S you know , ###T I does n't give them any money , ###\[ all , \+ \] everything is made *-1 from that .

20916:65	###and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know , E_S ###and that 's , N_S ###they use the money from that *-1 to fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program .

20970:50	###so I watch a lot of reruns , old shows , Like DICK VAN DYKE , all those old crazy shows . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###MUMBLEx . ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Barney Fife , I guess *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I really enjoy *-1 watching ANDY GRIFFITH . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . 
21077:37	###SpeakerA47 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###and , you know , I do n't want them watching something that I do n't think 0 they should watch *T*-1 E_S ###or , I used *-1 to be really hooked on ALL MY CHILDREN , E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###Oh , me . E_S 
21095:57	###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###So I gave it up . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Ouch . E_S ###Fifteen years . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###* Bet 0 they hated that . E_S 
21112:39	###and , um , I 'll turn it on every once in awhile E_S ###and I do n't recognize anybody , E_S ###so I guess 0 that 's a good sign . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Really .

21222:11	###SpeakerA103 . ###* Have a good day . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Thanks . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Bye-bye . E_S ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###well , I can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows E_S 
21254:20	###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###but \[ they , \+ that 's \] the way 0 it is *T*-1 , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###It *EXP*-1 's funny that those are \[ my two , \+ my husband 's two \] favorite shows , too , E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###SpeakerB14 . ###and I enjoy \[ both , \+ *-1 watching both \] of them , E_S ###but I used *-1 to did n't like NIGHT COURT E_S 
21305:4	###SpeakerB28 . ###yeah , E_S ###I think so , E_S ###which in QUANTUM LEAP you get *T*-1 N_S ###even though the person is involved in so many other people 's lives , you still see \[ a , \+ a \] real person in those situations . E_S ###\[ He gets , \+ um , he 's \] doing amazing things E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###but he 's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do *T*-1 E_S 
21309:4	###even though the person is involved in so many other people 's lives , you still see \[ a , \+ a \] real person in those situations . E_S ###\[ He gets , \+ um , he 's \] doing amazing things E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###but he 's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S ###that 's a good point , E_S 
21315:31	###SpeakerA31 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S ###that 's a good point , E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###and I think 0 that 's , N_S ###I like that . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###So \[ what do you , \+ what do you \] consider *T*-1 your favorite shows ? E_S ###SpeakerB34 . 
21324:26	###SpeakerB34 . ###Um , I think 0 my favorite show is HUNTER . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###And , \[ I , \+ I \] like the old \[ ser- , \+ series \] better when , um Dede was in there *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Dede , E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah E_S 
21330:54	###SpeakerA37 . ###Dede , E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I agree . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###\[ \[ and , \+ um , so , \] \+ uh , uh , and then \] the blond that they took *T*-1 out , the one that *T*-2 got killed *-3 E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
21342:16	###but is , N_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###yeah , E_S ###I did n't enjoy her . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I , \] N_S ###she was too much of a opposite of Dede , E_S ###and I think 0 that 's what they try *-2 to do *T*-1 , E_S ###but I think 0 we wanted *-1 to see Dede *ICH*-2 there or somebody like her . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
21349:23	###but I think 0 we wanted *-1 to see Dede *ICH*-2 there or somebody like her . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Well , but , see I read an article \[ about , \+ in T V GUIDE \[ about , \+ uh , about \] \] HUNTER , and about \[ his , you know , latest , \+ you know , his \] three girls , whatever you want *-1 to call them *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###and they say that , uh , \[ that there was abso- , \+ that there was like a conflict \] between her and him , uh , that they never really could get her into , uh , any character that they could use *T*-1 . E_S 
21355:138	###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###and they say that , uh , \[ that there was abso- , \+ that there was like a conflict \] between her and him , uh , that they never really could get her into , uh , any character that they could use *T*-1 . E_S ###I mean , you know , uh N_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###The second lady ? E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###yeah , E_S ###the second one the blond E_S 
21384:23	###SpeakerA59 . ###\[ \[ And , \+ and , \] \+ and \] \[ even , \+ even \] at the beginning Dede \[ and , \+ and \] Hunter would decide that one of them would go *-1 do this , while the other one \[ would do , \+ would go \] this , E_S ###but , uh , it seemed like it was almost two different organizations you know , E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###like Hunter was the boss , E_S ###and this other girl was not *?* , E_S ###and , you know , \[ you kind of , \+ you 're wondering , \] you know , well when did this happen *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
21393:64	###SpeakerB62 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###So , yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] kind of agree with that . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And I like the new lady better , E_S ###but I 'd just as soon that they did n't have the romance there . E_S ###I 'd just as soon have \[ the , \+ the \] police story without all the romance . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . 
21404:29	###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 most shows were doing that , E_S ###and then they went away from it E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###and now they 're starting *-1 to go back to it , E_S ###and maybe that 's what the public wants *T*-1 , E_S ###I do n't know , E_S 
21413:16	###I do n't know , E_S ###but \[ I just , \+ I like \] \[ the , \+ the \] cut and dry * solve the mystery , E_S ###and that 's what *ICH*-2 I always enjoyed *T*-1 about it . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , see , there was that spark between Dede and Hunter for a while E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###but \[ they , \+ they \] like started it , E_S 
21416:14	###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , see , there was that spark between Dede and Hunter for a while E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###but \[ they , \+ they \] like started it , E_S ###and then they 'd pull it back , E_S ###and they 'd start it and pull it back . E_S ###And that really made it a very interesting , uh , show to where you never really knew \[ which , \+ which \] one *T*-1 was going *-6 to show up . You know , whether it was going to , where they 're going *-2 to be real close *T*-4 or whether they 're just going *-3 to be partners *T*-5 , you know E_S 
21426:40	###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###And , \[ that , \+ that \] I kind of thought 0 *T*-1 was good , E_S ###but , um , you know , it 's , I guess 0 *T*-1 , you know , N_S ###you always kind of sit there E_S ###and you see these two people together , E_S ###and you always wonder , why they do n't , you know , get together or whatever *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S 
21426:70	###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###And , \[ that , \+ that \] I kind of thought 0 *T*-1 was good , E_S ###but , um , you know , it 's , I guess 0 *T*-1 , you know , N_S ###you always kind of sit there E_S ###and you see these two people together , E_S ###and you always wonder , why they do n't , you know , get together or whatever *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S 
21426:133	###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###And , \[ that , \+ that \] I kind of thought 0 *T*-1 was good , E_S ###but , um , you know , it 's , I guess 0 *T*-1 , you know , N_S ###you always kind of sit there E_S ###and you see these two people together , E_S ###and you always wonder , why they do n't , you know , get together or whatever *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S 
21434:18	###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###And so I guess 0 that 's what they decide *-1 to do *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###* Just go ahead and quit the wondering E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###\[ and , \+ and , \] N_S 
21438:26	###SpeakerB76 . ###* Just go ahead and quit the wondering E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###\[ and , \+ and , \] N_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###But \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-3 's \] always been a formula , uh , for T V \[ that the minute that two people , \+ that the two main stars \] get married *-1 *T*-4 , that the show ends up , you know , *-2 dying . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah . E_S 
21453:39	###They had GET SMART for , uh , ten hours a day , from seven o'clock at night , until six or until five o'clock the next morning . All the GET SMART episodes 0 you could ever see *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Well , \[ the , \+ the \] last day , all 0 they did *T*-1 was the last season , to where the two of them got married *-2 *T*-3 E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###and \[ that was , \+ I mean , that was \] the killer , E_S ###the series died right after that , because , N_S 
21458:68	###SpeakerB84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###and \[ that was , \+ I mean , that was \] the killer , E_S ###the series died right after that , because , N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###\[ I did n't , \+ I was going *-1 to say , 0 I did n't \] ever watch MOONLIGHTING , E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###well * go ahead . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . 
21469:23	###SpeakerA89 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###same thing . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###that , uh , interplay died when they got married *-1 *T*-2 , E_S ###and so the show died . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah , E_S ###the , N_S ###it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things \[ \[ before they , \+ they , \] \+ before they \] get married *-1 you know , E_S 
21474:20	###and so the show died . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah , E_S ###the , N_S ###it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things \[ \[ before they , \+ they , \] \+ before they \] get married *-1 you know , E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###the minute 0 they get married *-1 *T*-2 , everything 's supposed *-3 to be cut and dried E_S ###\[ and \+ and , \] well , of course , another one of their mistakes , I think 0 *T*-3 , is 0 they have a tendency *-2 to change characters , or to change the characters ' , uh , uh , personalities well , especially after they get married *-1 . E_S 
21498:68	###Well , in short , whenever they got married *-1 *T*-2 , she got dingy . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###You know , why would they do that *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###It made no sense . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . 
21499:18	###SpeakerB102 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###You know , why would they do that *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###It made no sense . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] guess 0 it 's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows N_S 
21503:14	###SpeakerB104 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###It made no sense . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] guess 0 it 's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows N_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Unfortunately , that 's probably true . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###yeah , E_S 
21509:56	###SpeakerA107 . ###Unfortunately , that 's probably true . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###yeah , E_S ###which *T*-1 kind of , N_S ###like in the big soap opera shows , which I do n't enjoy *T*-1 because of that , E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Well , do you you watch , um , what is that show *T*-1 , WHO 'S THE BOSS *T*-2 ? E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ uh , that 's \] on Tuesday nights I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S 
21514:4	###like in the big soap opera shows , which I do n't enjoy *T*-1 because of that , E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Well , do you you watch , um , what is that show *T*-1 , WHO 'S THE BOSS *T*-2 ? E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ uh , that 's \] on Tuesday nights I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###I 've seen it before , E_S ###but I do n't watch it regularly . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah , E_S 
21515:24	###but , N_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Well , do you you watch , um , what is that show *T*-1 , WHO 'S THE BOSS *T*-2 ? E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ uh , that 's \] on Tuesday nights I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###I 've seen it before , E_S ###but I do n't watch it regularly . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , \[ I \+ I \] hardly ever watch it , E_S 
21518:47	###\[ That 's , \+ uh , that 's \] on Tuesday nights I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###I 've seen it before , E_S ###but I do n't watch it regularly . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , \[ I \+ I \] hardly ever watch it , E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###Usually Tuesday nights I 'm out , E_S ###so . N_S 
21530:85	###and then they pulled them apart E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###and I think 0 they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###So . I always thought 0 that was kind of weird . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . 
21535:98	###SpeakerB116 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###So . I always thought 0 that was kind of weird . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it *EXP*-1 's funny how \[ \[ we , \+ uh , we , \] \+ we \] romanticize people *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . 
21542:18	###SpeakerA119 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###like , for instance , where as the teenager , you know , you \[ romance a , \+ romanticize a \] rock star , E_S ###but when he gets married *-1 *T*-2 , then you do n't care any more or something like that , E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###Um , right . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###and I think 0 it 's the same with your characters on T V . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . 
21547:7	###SpeakerA121 . ###Um , right . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###and I think 0 it 's the same with your characters on T V . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###Do you think 0 that 's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret *T*-1 , or at least they keep it quiet *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###Probably , E_S ###yeah E_S ###SpeakerA125 . 
21553:23	###SpeakerB124 . ###Probably , E_S ###yeah E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###I mean , N_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###I know 0 it affected me when I was younger *T*-1 . E_S ###I 'm not into rock stars too much lately , E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###Yeah . E_S 
21560:24	###I 'm not into rock stars too much lately , E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###No , E_S ###like Madonna and Sean Penn . E_S ###Now I do n't particularly like either one of them E_S ###SpeakerB130 . 
21590:5	###so , * having twenty million people watch you do that . N_S ###SpeakerA139 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's , N_S ###they would n't be easy . E_S ###SpeakerB140 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###So , um , well that 's kind of interesting . E_S ###SpeakerB142 . 
21649:34	###SpeakerA6 . ###Well both of mine are boys . E_S ###They 're eight and eleven E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###SpeakerB9 . ###Okay , E_S ###and did , N_S ###SpeakerA10 .

23206:19	###but it was only like seven dollars , ###not too bad . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Oh . E_S ###I 'd have *-1 to check into something like that , because , I mean , we do n't drink a whole lot of soda around here , you know , E_S ###but , um you know , occasionally we have some around , E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah .

23287:7	###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###and it 's just got Happy Birthday printing on it , and a cute little phrase inside , E_S ###and it 's just a paper bag E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###you know , and it 's really cute . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . 
23316:16	###I guess 0 they still ship it out on barges somewhere . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ so . \+ But \] I think 0 we 're getting better at it E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA79 .

E_S ###Well , \[ does \[ your , \+ \] the company say , \+ for instance , does the company \] 0 you worked for *T*-1 \[ bef- , \+ before \] have the right *RNR*-2 or do they have the ability *RNR*-2 * to say , hey , we 've already drug tested her E_S ###and she came up negative . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Well , no , E_S ###I do n't think 0 \[ they can , \+ they can \] force another company to not drug test me just by *-1 saying that \[ I , \+ I \] did n't , I mean , N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . 
24711:21	###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###The men that *T*-1 are out there *-3 fixing power lines are tested *-2 a lot E_S ###and the men that *T*-1 drive the trucks \[ with , \+ with \] the guys that *T*-2 fix the power lines are n't tested *-3 as much . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###SpeakerB86 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
24723:72	###SpeakerB88 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###They say \[ we , \+ we 're \] testing you tomorrow E_S ###and we 'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Okay , E_S ###so they know that . E_S ###And that 's ... N_S 
24801:59	###SpeakerA11 . ###Well , that 's really too bad because \[ it , \+ it 's \] giving some people unfair advantage . E_S ###I mean \[ we , \+ our \] high school up here is like a junior college in Florida E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###what we learned *T*-1 . N_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Well , that was my experience * going through junior high up there E_S ###when I came down south for high school *T*-1 I was just repeating what I 'd already done *T*-2 . Because we were so far advanced . E_S 
24808:4	###SpeakerB14 . ###Well , that was my experience * going through junior high up there E_S ###when I came down south for high school *T*-1 I was just repeating what I 'd already done *T*-2 . Because we were so far advanced . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And , uh , you know , I 'd been in a parochial school before junior high E_S ###and , you know , even the public schools are behind the parochial schools . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S 
24811:5	###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And , uh , you know , I 'd been in a parochial school before junior high E_S ###and , you know , even the public schools are behind the parochial schools . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###So , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] like the concept 0 they 've got *T*-1 now where they have more directed education *T*-2 , you know , E_S ###\[ you , \+ you \] pick a career path E_S 
24811:45	###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And , uh , you know , I 'd been in a parochial school before junior high E_S ###and , you know , even the public schools are behind the parochial schools . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###So , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] like the concept 0 they 've got *T*-1 now where they have more directed education *T*-2 , you know , E_S ###\[ you , \+ you \] pick a career path E_S 
24820:66	###\[ you , \+ you \] pick a career path E_S ###or you get counseling earlier E_S ###and then \[ you , \+ you \] learn the things that *T*-1 help you rather than *-3 spending four years *-2 learning the same things over and over . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Like they have that *ICH*-1 down there that , N_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Well , they talk about it E_S ###and there are a few in some of the more , like in N_S ###I live in a big Metroplex E_S ###and some of \[ the , \+ the \] better parts of the Metroplex , \[ the , \+ the \] suburbs that *T*-1 are richer have those kind of target schools . E_S 
24834:111	###SpeakerB22 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###Or if you 're going *-1 to go the science route you can go to a target school that *T*-2 specializes in science or art . E_S ###You know , there 's no point in , you know , N_S ###I 'm an engineering student E_S ###and if I have *-1 to go *-2 take art classes , you know , I 'm not going *-3 to use them . E_S ###And through high school I could have gone so much further if I 'd gone to a school that *T*-1 was directed *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
24854:7	###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###I think 0 the schools today , you know , \[ the public schools are just , \+ they 're just \] overrun *-1 , you know , E_S ###they do n't know what * to do *T*-1 , E_S ###there 's too many kids and not enough teachers E_S ###and too many of the kids do n't care . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah , E_S 
24860:16	###there 's too many kids and not enough teachers E_S ###and too many of the kids do n't care . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I find \[ \[ that \+ that the , \] \+ that \] \[ in the , \+ in the \] cities , it 's more like the kids go there *-1 \[ so \+ \] socialize not really to learn E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###And , E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###Right . E_S 
24885:14	###he 's coming up , will you help me with my homework E_S ###and they 're , no , * get away from me , E_S ###I 've had a terrible day . E_S ###So , it 's got a lot 0 * to do *T*-1 with economics in the area that you come from *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###I 'm wondering with the boom down here . E_S ###It 's , ###well , not at the moment , E_S 
24909:60	###\[ \[ We 're , \+ we 're , \] \+ we 're \] behind down here . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###On the , N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###I say we because I live here .

E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ maybe the , \+ maybe they 'll \] bring their good schools with them . You know , E_S 
24948:16	###So , I do n't know .

27820:52	###And I 've developed a real love for , uh , classical music in , probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was , uh , heavy into classical type music .

28067:10	###SpeakerA40 . ###Well , actually I 've found out that I 'm not going *-1 to go back to *-2 being an engineer .

28080:7	###SpeakerB45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###and I 'm very mechanical , E_S ###and mechanical engineering interested me , E_S ###so I did that .

28165:48	###SpeakerB79 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so jobs have *-1 to , I guess , become more flexible .

E_S ###So , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA86 . 
28226:11	###SpeakerB105 . ###And a man might say out loud , well , you know , I understand this E_S ###and I agree , E_S ###but still he was raised *-1 with a mom taking care of him E_S ###SpeakerA106 . ###Yes , E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB107 . ###and that 's a very hard attitude 0 * to change *T*-1 .

28255:37	###Which *T*-4 brings us back to the idea , you know , 0 someone 's got *-5 to be there *-6 taking care of the kids *-6 to \[ drill in these \+ you know , drill in the \] right ideas to , so that they know that , uh , you know , male and female are both responsible for *-1 doing this E_S ###SpeakerA116 . ###That 's right .

E_S ###SpeakerA132 . ###They 're going *-1 to say to the kids you need *-2 do this , because it needs *-3 to be done *-4 not because it 's a woman 's job or a man 's job , but because it 's dirty and it needs *-5 to be clean .

28297:65	###And so , basically no one was taking the responsibility E_S ###SpeakerA140 . ###And \[ it 's going *-1 to , \+ It 's going *-2 to , \] N_S ###SpeakerB141 . ###and I think 0 that 's happened in a lot of cases .

E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###But , uh , you know , \[ it 's , \+ uh , it 's \] almost like we could become too dependent on them . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###And oh , \[ I , \+ we \] use a lot of free lance . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . 
28513:4	###I 'm just totally drawing a blank . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###SpeakerA63 . ###But , uh , the way 0 things have changed over the years with the P C and the different programs *T*-1 is just great . E_S ###It 's remarkable the things 0 we can do *T*-1 now , and compared to , you know , a few years . ###Just the power , E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] trying *-1 to , uh , get an updated machine . E_S 
28540:16	###We had a printer , a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###And we had about ten people sharing this printer E_S \[ by , \+ \] ###it was attached *-1 to like a central P C E_S ###and you had *-1 to take your diskette to the P C *-2 to print something . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Um , now that 's awful . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . 
28551:15	###So I talked my boss into *-1 investing in \[ \[ a , \+ ###it 's not a , \] \+ uh , a \] uh , real elaborate local area network , E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Huh-uh .

28562:47	###SpeakerA83 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###it 's what we need *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###And then I talked them into *-1 buying a H P Laser Jet . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Oh , yes . E_S 
28566:11	###SpeakerA85 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###And then I talked them into *-1 buying a H P Laser Jet . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Oh , yes .

28589:33	###SpeakerA93 . ###Huh-uh .

28622:16	###but , uh , we do a lot of transparencies . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Sometimes the color would take too long *-1 to plot out . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###So they just want black and white , which MUMBLEx see we can just run *T*-1 them through the laser printer real quick .

28631:26	###SpeakerB110 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###SpeakerB112 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###But , uh , it , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###So that 's all 0 you need *T*-1 for like MUMBLEx charts and stuff . E_S ###You do n't need them in four colors . E_S

29366:22	###and sometimes that , N_S ###I do n't know the value of that , because I saw plenty of jokes \[ and , \+ and , \] um , oh , editorial cartoons about all the retired generals , making a living during \[ the , \+ the \] Gulf War .

E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 .

29430:124	###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###I thought 0 that was a really unusual thing .

32994:9	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , uh , lately , since I have children I 've cut down on *-1 having dinner parties . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###but when I do *T*-2 I try *-1 to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare *T*-3 ahead of time , E_S ###uh , I have one recipe for , uh , a really good , um , type of a meatball . E_S ###It 's called *-1 burgundy meatball E_S ###and it 's made *-1 with red wine and , N_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
33000:7	###uh , I have one recipe for , uh , a really good , um , type of a meatball .

33011:49	###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###That 's one of my favorite things 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] serve *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Well , um , I think 0 it would probably depend on whether this was a formal *RNR*-1 or a informal *RNR*-1 dinner party . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###But if it was informal , my first choice would be crawfish . E_S 
33040:30	###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###\[ I , \+ in fact , I \] just came back from the grocery store E_S ###and *-1 being in Texas we do n't have too many , you know , people \[ that , \+ that *T*-2 \] eat crawfish E_S ###but they had live crawfish , on sale .

33061:17	###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###And you 're not supposed *-1 to eat those because they 're bad for you . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , I 'll remember that . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so if you ever go in a restaurant , * order crawfish , E_S 
33088:47	###SpeakerA39 . ###I think 0 for a dinner party N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know E_S ###it depends . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Um-hum . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Like \[ if , \+ like my age , ###if \] there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party , no , \[ I , \+ they \] would shell their own , E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
33118:47	###But you can buy uh the crawfish shells *-1 already peeled 'n everything E_S ###And usually you use those like for frying or 0 *-1 to put *T*-2 in salads or to um You know make a sauce with *T*-2 or something like that E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Um-hum E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###But you can go ahead and buy 'em *-1 cooked and shelled E_S ###and they 're more expensive of course E_S ###but N_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Does it taste a lot like shrimp E_S 
33140:18	###SpeakerB60 . ###Sure E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###but um I think that N_S ###And also * to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Yeah . E_S ###We have \[ a \+ a \] friend another couple where the husband is the one who *T*-1 cooks all the time *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 .

33603:60	###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###You know , I was real embarrassed , E_S ###but I felt kind of stupid . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Well , those things happen , though . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah , E_S ###they do . E_S 
33641:4	###In aerobics ? E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###no , E_S ###actually I was up on a ladder , and , uh , fell off . Leaned the wrong way . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Oh goodness . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . 
33652:7	###SpeakerA69 . ###What 'd they do *T*-1 for that ? E_S ###Did they have *-1 to cast it ? E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ they had , \+ well they had \] *-1 to go in and do surgery .

33695:18	###and I went , oh , I can do that E_S ###and half the time though I do n't jump half as much as , N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Uh-huh .

33703:7	###SpeakerB88 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###SpeakerB90 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Um , but when I see some wo- , N_S ###I mean , and I just do n't think 0 it 's healthy E_S ###all that pounding all the time . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . 
33710:12	###I mean , and I just do n't think 0 it 's healthy E_S ###all that pounding all the time . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###\[ It is n't , \+ really , it 's not \] really good for your knees .

33736:24	###I said , who *T*-1 has engineered that ? . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###But I , N_S ###* sounds you , like N_S ###one thing that I like *T*-1 , like swimming , ###you like that a lot ? E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Uh-huh , E_S

33766:14	###but it 's the other way around . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Right . E_S ###It curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###Yeah E_S ###really . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah E_S ###but , N_S 
33803:18	###And he goes , human nature .

E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###And as we were doing it , too , everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities . E_S ###MUMBLEx walked out , E_S ###I was one thing , N_S ###oh great , I have purple tights on , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . 
33908:74	###But I just , N_S ###the more 0 they tried *-1 to get my foot in *T*-2 the more I screamed *T*-3 , E_S ###I could n't , you know adjust that .

33952:12	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I do n't know .

E_S ###Uh , I 'm against it E_S ###but on the same token , uh , I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right * to do that . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Ye- , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###So \[ I , \+ I \] have a rifle in the house . E_S ###Uh , the ammunition is probably so old 0 I 'm afraid *-1 to use it . E_S 
33955:60	###Uh , I 'm against it E_S ###but on the same token , uh , I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right * to do that .

33964:9	###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , I think , uh , 0 down here in Texas they do n't have a waiting period on handguns . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###And , I think 0 they need that . E_S ###Uh , and \[ I do have a , \+ I have a \] pistol . E_S ###It 's a little twenty-two E_S ###and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
33988:42	###And I thought 0 that was really good .

34027:4	###SpeakerA33 . ###About nine days . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Huh . E_S ###That was n't \[ too , \+ too \] bad . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###No . E_S ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Because \[ if , \+ if \] you 're going *-1 to go *-2 buy something , uh , uh , of that nature , I think 0 \[ you , \+ you 're \] going *-3 to have some idea as to what you 're going *-4 to do *T*-5 with it . E_S 
34037:134	###You 're not going *-1 to react that quickly . E_S ###In other words , you know , you do n't have a need * to go *-1 buy a gun *-3 to go *-2 shoot it the next day . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Th- , N_S ###somebody wants *-1 to do that , N_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ at times I \] think 0 they ought *-1 to have a waiting period on all firearms .

E_S ###They both do the same kind of job . E_S 
34064:85	###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###And the spread changes . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh , I 've got a manual single shot E_S 
34123:16	###when he was in that gun club where he was doing that *T*-1 *T*-2 . N_S ###It , you know , N_S ###he went mostly *-1 just to , uh , shoot at paper targets . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh , but , you know , they used speed and accuracy and all that . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###I think \[ that , \+ that \] the gun clubs serve a useful purpose . E_S ###In fact , I 'd like *-1 to see 0 somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon *T*-2 you have * to , uh , show that you 've gone to school or gone to some class * to know how * to handle that weapon *T*-3 . N_S 
34142:42	###And you give him a license because he waited nine days . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's , N_S ###and , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###\[ He could , \+ he could \] not only , uh , uh , shoot himself . E_S ###\[ He could , \+ he could , \] uh , mishandle a weapon . Leave it at home and let a child get at it .

34168:16	###It was about four or five years ago . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###SpeakerA81 . ###But . ###Now , I guess 0 that would be a good idea . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###About , uh , private citizens selling a weapons ? E_S ###Like if you wanted *-1 to sell your pistol to me . E_S ###How do you feel about that *T*-1 ?

34177:4	###Do you believe 0 there ought *-1 to be legislation guiding the , uh , buyer and the seller ?

E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###SpeakerB84 . ###SpeakerA85 . ###Uh , that 's a hard one because we did that . E_S ###But , uh , I think 0 there ought *-1 to be some rule against it . E_S ###I 'll , uh , you know , N_S ###the person who *T*-1 sells the gun ought *-4 to protect themselves because if that gun 's registered *-2 to them and somebody else uses that gun in something , the cops are going *-3 to come to you .

34353:8	###SpeakerB2 . ###Um , a lot , N_S ###well , the last movie 0 I saw *T*-1 , but it was n't my choice , was the NINJA TURTLE movie . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Obviously you have kids .

34417:16	###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###I really enjoy , N_S ###they keep me guessing the whole time . E_S ###\[ It 's really , \+ it was really \] interesting .

34437:73	###and she 's got two boys that I took *T*-1 *-2 to see the first one . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###So I 'm sure 0 I 'm going *-1 to see the next one here real soon .

34541:40	###He did n't look like a cop when he did it *T*-1 . E_S ###And I was so impressed with that because , you know , usually , N_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###That 's neat .

34705:16	###You know popcorn is not that expensive . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###No , E_S ###nowhere near that expensive . E_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###And , \[ it , \+ it 's \] just the idea that \[ these , \+ uh , these \] actors , you know , live in such lavish style . E_S ###I mean , it 's as simple as that . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . 
34743:70	###SpeakerB156 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . ###SpeakerB158 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA159 . ###SpeakerB160 . ###Oh really ? E_S ###SpeakerA161 . ###You really truly do . E_S

34791:11	###SpeakerB174 . ###SpeakerA175 . ###It was just too perfect at all times . E_S ###SpeakerB176 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA177 . ###That was a mistake that they made *T*-1 . E_S ###They should n't have done it . E_S ###SpeakerB178 . ###Yeah . E_S

34820:16	###SpeakerA187 . ###Okay , E_S ###no problems .

35178:13	###and that suffices me . E_S ###But , \[ I like , \+ I like \] \[ good comedy , \+ good humor \] once in a while . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###Yeah .

35193:25	###and then you 're , you know , trying *-1 to pass the time *-2 to wait until the next comedian comes up . E_S ###SpeakerA110 . ###SpeakerB111 . ###You know what I did *T*-1 .

35271:10	###I think 0 it 's come around again . E_S ###It 's gone through cycles . E_S ###SpeakerB137 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it was , N_S ###we stopped *-1 watching for a couple of years in the middle there , E_S ###but we started *-1 watching again . E_S ###SpeakerA138 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB139 . 
35282:35	###SpeakerA140 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB141 . ###It 's funny now , E_S ###and it 's better , E_S ###but it 's real different than what it used *-1 to be *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA142 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB143 . ###SpeakerA144 . 
35288:22	###SpeakerA142 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB143 . ###SpeakerA144 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB145 . ###But you \[ ca n't be so , \+ ca n't be outrageous . \] E_S ###SpeakerA146 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB147 . 
35335:8	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , \[ \[ we 've , \+ uh , we 've , \] \+ we 've \] test driven the Oldsmobile Delta Eighty-eight and a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac , about three or four years old because , uh , I get married *-1 in a couple of weeks E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh .

35439:7	###the price already drops in half . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###So then it becomes , uh , more realistic . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S ###That 's what I 'm thinking about *T*-1 on my next car is do I want *-2 to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
35447:12	###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###But \[ I just , \+ I \] kind of worry about *-2 getting a car that *T*-1 's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that *T*-3 owned it want *-4 to get rid *-5 of it *T*-6 . E_S ###Is it a lemon , E_S ###\[ or \+ , or \] is something wrong with it E_S 
35455:94	###Is it a lemon , E_S ###\[ or \+ , or \] is something wrong with it E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###but I guess 0 that 's a risk 0 you have *-1 to take *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###SpeakerB60 . 
35481:30	###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###About how much do they charge *T*-1 *-2 to do something like that , E_S ###do you know ? E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Oh , I 'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's not bad . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . 
35484:7	###do you know ? E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Oh , I 'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's not bad . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###No , E_S ###huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . 
35518:10	###SpeakerA83 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###and when you 're ready *-1 to get another car *T*-2 * just pay cash for it . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I just about could *?* really because I think 0 my car , N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . 
35522:7	###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I just about could *?* really because I think 0 my car , N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###if I continue *-1 taking good care of it , it 's going *-2 to hold a pretty good resale value E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Oh yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . 
35546:29	###SpeakerB94 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S ###that 's fine . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Anyway . E_S ###But , uh , \[ I really , \+ I really \] enjoy the car 0 I have *T*-1 now , E_S ###and I do want *-1 to hold onto it \[ and , \+ and \] you know , enjoy it while it 's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever , E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###That 's right . E_S 
35625:5	###SpeakerB128 . ###It 's \[ a , \+ a \] Buick Century . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Are you going *-1 to trade it in on this new one E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###No , E_S ###my fiance is selling , uh , a nineteen seventy-eight Cutlass Supreme that she has *T*-1 . E_S ###It 's actually , in better condition than my car . E_S 
35660:5	###Well I turned around and sold it myself for forty-two hundred . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###Oh there you go . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###You can do much better . E_S ###I 'm glad 0 \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] taking care of it yourself . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 * trading it in , they just use that as additional , N_S ###they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car 0 you 're buying *T*-1 , E_S ###but they just , are going *-1 to give you that much less for your trade in . E_S 
35674:4	###So , N_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###I think 0 you 're right . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###But strangely enough , \[ the best off- , \+ I mean , the best bargaining \] 0 I had made *T*-1 with a dealer on my car was also the same place 0 I got the best price trade in *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerB150 . ###Interesting . E_S ###SpeakerA151 . ###but it 's a place in Arlington , E_S ###and I think , 0 maybe , as you get outside the Dallas area , E_S 
35686:29	###Well , maybe because it 's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better prices , E_S ###plus I was going through that T I fleet discount program . E_S ###SpeakerB152 . ###Okay , E_S ###\[ did , \+ did \] you use it at the car shop place . E_S ###SpeakerA153 . ###Well , it 's before they had that . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . 
35698:21	###SpeakerB156 . ###That 's right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . ###and what you could expect *T*-1 *ICH*-2 , they said *T*-3 , you know , a five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything . E_S ###SpeakerB158 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA159 . ###SpeakerB160 . ###Right . E_S 
35698:32	###SpeakerB156 . ###That 's right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . ###and what you could expect *T*-1 *ICH*-2 , they said *T*-3 , you know , a five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything . E_S ###SpeakerB158 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA159 . ###SpeakerB160 . ###Right . E_S 
35703:8	###SpeakerB158 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA159 . ###SpeakerB160 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA161 . ###So , I figured out a price based on that . E_S ###SpeakerB162 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's good . E_S 
35715:105	###SpeakerB164 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA165 . ###SpeakerB166 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA167 . ###and they said 0 there is no way 0 you can get this car for that price *T*-1 , especially if we add on the equalizer and the cruise control . E_S ###SpeakerB168 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA169 . 
35733:7	###SpeakerB172 . ###Is that right . E_S ###SpeakerA173 . ###And they had already told me , We located one at Town North . E_S ###So it was that same car . E_S ###SpeakerB174 . ###My gosh . E_S ###SpeakerA175 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , unless you 're selling car with hail damage and flood damage , I got the car off your lot for that price . E_S 
35733:108	###SpeakerB172 . ###Is that right . E_S ###SpeakerA173 . ###And they had already told me , We located one at Town North . E_S ###So it was that same car . E_S ###SpeakerB174 . ###My gosh .

35748:18	###SpeakerB178 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA179 . ###and , uh , that they required you to do *T*-1 . E_S ###And I took it to Town North , E_S ###and sure enough I saw that guy , E_S ###and he recognized me . E_S ###SpeakerB180 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA181 . 
35761:29	###SpeakerB182 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA183 . ###of course , when the place in Arlington went and took the car *T*-3 ###because I told him 0 there 's a place in Arlington that *T*-1 's going *-2 to give it to me for that price . E_S ###SpeakerB184 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA185 . ###He said , No they 're not *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB186 . 
35842:30	###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###Is that right ? E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh , * did a lot of * growing up . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###I bet . E_S 
35863:20	###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###He came from a poor immigrant family , E_S ###and he did n't have a chance *-1 to , uh , you know , N_S ###the family was n't wealthy , E_S ###so he had *-1 to do something *-1 to , put himself through school , E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Do it himself . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . 
35895:31	###SpeakerB38 . ###That 's pretty good . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###But , I 've been in school ever since . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###That 's good . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
35930:81	###and if they 're able-bodied people , I do n't see any problem *ICH*-1 at all with * having them go out there \[ and , \+ and , \] ###if nothing else , get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards , paint the houses . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we 'd learn service to other people in this country . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Sure , E_S

36217:17	###SpeakerB160 . ###And they served a good function . E_S ###SpeakerA161 . ###And they served a good function , E_S ###but there are enough laws *ICH*-1 on the books now that unions are outdated , E_S ###and they 're only there *-1 to perpetuate \[ their own , \+ their own \] power structure . E_S ###SpeakerB162 . ###I remember , 0 the company 0 my dad worked for *T*-1 , the people there went on strike against the management . E_S ###It was a steel manufacturing place , E_S ###and they , uh , N_S 
36228:20	###and they were having a hard time . E_S ###And they told the strikers there , look , E_S we need you to come back and get this stuff done *-2 . E_S ###Or else we 're going *-1 to be out of business . E_S ###And they would n't come back , E_S ###so they went bankrupt . E_S ###SpeakerA163 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB164 . ###\[ And , \+ and \] they all lost their jobs . E_S ###SpeakerA165 . 
36240:42	###SpeakerB166 . ###And it 's like , you know . N_S ###SpeakerA167 . ###SpeakerB168 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA169 . ###So many times , I mean , you had \[ the , \+ uh , the \] coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time .

36281:16	###SpeakerB182 . ###It teaches them pride in their country . E_S ###SpeakerA183 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and pride in themselves , too . E_S ###SpeakerB184 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA185 . ###\[ \[ They could , \+ they could , \] \+ I mean , you could \] organize something just within your community . ###SpeakerB186 . 
36324:5	###* Play golf some , E_S ###and I work out \[ on a , \+ on a \] hanging bag . E_S ###I 'm brown belt in karate , E_S ###so I keep up with that a little bit . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
36373:26	###or do you go to groups E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] do it on my own schedule . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###We used *-1 to try and belong to clubs or the Y , stuff like that , E_S ###but it *EXP*-3 was so difficult * to go on a regular basis , to drive the distance 0 you have *-1 to go *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . 
36390:23	###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 've got a weight bench , E_S ###and we got my wife an exercise bike , E_S ###and I use that sometimes too . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###It 's a little more convenient , E_S ###but , \[ you 're , \+ I guess 0 you 're \] not as dedicated if you do n't drive over *-1 to do it . E_S 
36402:38	###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Because my husband used *-1 to work out three days a week \[ with , \+ \] uh , at the Texas Instruments gym .

36847:23	###* just stay in your truck .

36919:5	###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###this topic is , is Russia a threat to our security ? E_S ###I think 0 they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time .

37608:22	###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh , that 's a good question .

41206:33	###SpeakerB118 . ###Oh ! E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###But , then it has like a kitchenette and things like that E_S ###but you , N_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###See , that would be great because then you could spend so much more time *ICH*-1 together , than if you all were in your own hotels or something . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . 
41231:5	###SpeakerB128 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###SpeakerB130 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###* Ask them what they have *T*-1 , you know , at area lakes and all . If they have something like that E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA133 .

41599:25	###SpeakerA24 . ###Yes .

41605:8	###SpeakerB27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###SpeakerB29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###What about the mini skirt ? E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###There are a few people *ICH*-2 every now and then that *T*-1 wear those to work . E_S ###They 're pretty strict about that , though . E_S 
41647:11	###SpeakerA40 . ###and again it depends upon the size , the shape of the person , as well as the shape of the person 's legs . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Uh-huh .

41662:28	###SpeakerB47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###Uh , even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through , uh , grandmothers , in my class . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###And , uh , \[ whe- , \+ \] I always try *-1 to emphasize 0 the , clothes that you wear *T*-2 should not necessarily be the greatest fad , E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
41682:59	###SpeakerB57 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S 
41693:7	###SpeakerB61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###uh , I , uh , uh , N_S ###again maybe because I was at the school , there were still many teachers who *T*-2 wore mini skirts , E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###uh , we had no regulation against it E_S ###and a lot of the kids did of course , E_S 
41698:48	###SpeakerB63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###uh , we had no regulation against it E_S ###and a lot of the kids did of course , E_S ###and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###Right .

41708:24	###SpeakerB67 . ###Right .

41765:39	###\[ and , \+ uh , and \] I find 0 \[ even , \+ even \] at home here now , \[ I , I \] will wear blue jeans or I 'll wear shorts and what have you *T*-1 , uh , and be very comfortable E_S ###but when I go out somewhere *T*-1 , then , uh , unless I have a pair of dress slacks , I do n't usually wear a lot of blue jeans .

44640:68	###I do n't know that a cat would do that , uh . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I used *-1 to have , a cat that *T*-2 could read me better than any human being in my life .

44680:226	###SpeakerB70 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###That 's the way , N_S ###well , I had that cat that I mentioned *T*-1 , Alfie . E_S ###One morning , you know , ###the first thing 0 you do *T*-1 is you get up and \[ \[ you , \+ you , \] \+ you \] feed this cat \[ some- , \+ something \] \[ and , \+ and \] you make * sure that it can get to its litter box . E_S ###Well , for some reason during the night , the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through E_S 
44694:28	###SpeakerA75 . ###SpeakerB76 . ###And so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket , for me . *-1 \[ Looking , \+ looking \] at me eye to eye , all the time while it was doing it .

44726:64	###and , uh , then she recouped . E_S ###She was okay for a couple of years . E_S ###And then she got sick on me again E_S ###and I brought her to a different vet this time E_S ###and I told the vet what medication I had given her *T*-1 and everything . E_S ###And , uh , he gave me \[ the medication , \+ the same medication \] that I gave her *T*-1 the last time E_S ###and she was okay E_S ###and she 's been okay every since . E_S ###It 's been about two years now . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . 
44731:19	###And , uh , he gave me \[ the medication , \+ the same medication \] that I gave her *T*-1 the last time E_S ###and she was okay E_S ###and she 's been okay every since . E_S ###It 's been about two years now . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Huh . ###Well , that 's great , E_S ###it really is *?* . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] glad that she was able *-1 to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . 
44743:160	###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Of course , you would *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###But \[ what they , \+ well , what they \] do *T*-1 is , is they say , well it 's going *-2 to cost , you know , twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this E_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ you know , and \] it creeps up on you . E_S ###You do n't know that , uh , you know . E_S ###\[ \[ You really , \+ y- , \] \+ you \] do n't know what it 's going *-1 to *?* *T*-2 until it 's all over . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###SpeakerA91 .

My mom had an elderly cat who , uh , ###whoever *T*-1 evidently got a hold of it N_S ###and , uh , the cat got sick . E_S ###So she took the cat to the vet E_S ###and she had the cat there for two days E_S 
44751:50	###SpeakerB90 . ###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh , * to give you an example . My mom had an elderly cat who , uh , ###whoever *T*-1 evidently got a hold of it N_S ###and , uh , the cat got sick . E_S ###So she took the cat to the vet E_S ###and she had the cat there for two days E_S ###and then the cat died . E_S ###So the doctor had called her up and said , uh , your cat died E_S ###and you owe me this bill , E_S 
44780:16	###SpeakerA99 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well even the , you know , N_S ###\[ they , \+ they \] claimed 0 they did the best that they could \[ have \+ have *?* *T*-1 \] E_S ###and then the cat , uh , died . E_S ###So N_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###My goodness . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] looking for another cat for them . 
44827:4	###SpeakerB118 . ###That 's my buzzer at the door . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###I 'll let you go . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . 
44854:16	###They 're going *-1 to do what they want *-2 to do *T*-3 . E_S ###They 're corrupt anyway . E_S ###And I think 0 one of the good ways of * solving that is \[ to \+ like , everybody likes *-1 to come to \] a party so * have a voting party \[ and , \+ \] uh , you know , like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go *-2 vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , N_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###I mean that 's the only , thing that I can figure *T*-2 out because I 've heard so many people say well I 'm not going on voting on that one , you know , ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] going *-1 to go *-3 fishing today . ###Or it wo n't make any difference \[ if , \+ if \] I do n't vote E_S ###SpeakerB10 . 
44855:24	###They 're corrupt anyway .

44871:53	###SpeakerA13 . ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Because people have *-1 to vote in different areas E_S ###and , uh , not everyone votes at the same place . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , I , personally , think that we need *-1 to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up , with the idea of \[ the , \+ the \] value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference . E_S 
44906:4	###That , N_S ###uh , perhaps we 'll finally get the youth weaned *-1 off of it . E_S ###But , uh , I know \[ I , \+ I \] spent thirty-four years in education here in the Dayton area E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###SpeakerB32 . ###and in nineteen fifty-one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana , giving away their heroin and what have *T*-2 you *T*-1 , *-3 to get them started *-4 .

44906:31	###That , N_S ###uh , perhaps we 'll finally get the youth weaned *-1 off of it .

44912:51	###SpeakerA33 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###And , you know , that was in fifty-one . E_S ###That 's forty years ago that it was already a problem . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###God .

44912:93	###SpeakerA33 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###And , you know , that was in fifty-one . E_S ###That 's forty years ago that it was already a problem . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###God .

44923:77	###SpeakerA37 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###and we also do n't make \[ the , \+ uh , the \] issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well I do n't know how it is *T*-1 up there E_S ###but down here , Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
44930:19	###but down here , Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###I mean , I 'm sure 0 you heard about some of ours . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###SpeakerB44 . ###Right . E_S 
44968:32	###SpeakerB52 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###And , uh , I know 0 my husband ###now we go *-1 vote every time . E_S ###I do n't care how small the ballot is *T*-1 , I mean , if there 's one thing , if there 's one issue , E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . 
44974:16	###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###because the way 0 I feel *T*-2 is 0 if I do n't vote , then I do n't have any reason , 0 * to gripe *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###To complain about it , ###right ? E_S 
44996:97	###SpeakerB64 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###SpeakerB66 . ###Tha- , N_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###He needs your vote ###just like he needs everybody else 's , you know .

45029:139	###\[ and \+ uh , \[ but it , \+ but you 're \] \] right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###SpeakerA77 . ###SpeakerB78 . ###And perhaps it 's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive 0 * to run *T*-1 , uh , that only the most wealthy can do so . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . 
45061:23	###SpeakerB90 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###If they did something like that and started kids out *-3 real young and showed them , okay now you 're not going *-1 to get *-2 to vote E_S ###but you 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do what that person says *T*-3 , E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Yes .

45078:76	###SpeakerA97 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Now some people object during primaries , *-1 having *-2 to declare a party , whether Republican or Democrat E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###and you do that in the primary . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
45095:128	###SpeakerA103 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###And it 's going *-1 to take these young N_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###I think 0 that sounds great . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###you know , it 's going *-1 to take \[ the , \+ uh , a \] whole generation of my feeling , uh , before that 's going *-2 to be accomplished *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Well , you know , they 'd have *-1 to start when they 're real young *T*-2 . E_S 
45105:39	###SpeakerB108 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###I mean , you know , it would have *-1 to be a child that *T*-2 is just coming into school . E_S ###Because , well I 'll tell you another thing too now .

45146:25	###And it really scared me , really bad . E_S Because I thought all these people are going *-1 to laugh at me because I do n't know how * to work this machine *T*-3 .

45805:17	###* does n't give you much respect for their team at all .

45877:14	###SpeakerB76 . ###I know . E_S ###Who was the quarterback *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Well , They , had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it .

45968:11	###SpeakerB114 . ###That was a few years ago . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , he was good .

46131:19	###SpeakerB178 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA179 . ###So , we 're watching the game . E_S ###All right . E_S ###The other team got the ball E_S ###and \[ we had \+ like , no , we got \] the ball back . E_S ###That 's the way 0 it was *T*-1 .

46224:96	###and , the , um , N_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Do they have many buildings that *T*-1 have security there ? E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Some buildings do , E_S ###it depends on the location .

46764:31	###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###I mean it looks , I guess , kind of like , uh , the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow , E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###no , E_S ###what N_S ###\[ Astro , \+ Astro , \] I guess , is what it , 
46774:38	###something like that , E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Oh , okay , E_S ###yeah .

46802:10	###and , uh , you know , I always been looking for something sporty E_S ###and I ended up *-2 getting , you know , basically something that I could , you know , afford *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###The only gripe 0 I have *T*-1 is performance .

46851:11	###SpeakerA81 . ###I do n't know , E_S ###it sounds funny though , does n't it ? E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Huh , E_S ###anyway , um , but I 'll probably , um , N_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###it just depends , E_S 
46862:21	###but I do n't know if I 'll get myself to spend that kind of money , E_S ###you 're looking \[ at , \+ you know , for \] a new R X seven or , a Supra or something , E_S you 're looking at twenty-five K or something , that like E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Oh , at least , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###and so , \[ ###anyway \+ but , ###Anyway \] my ultimate car *ICH*-2 though , \[ the , \+ the \] one that I really want *T*-1 is , uh , five sixty or so , Mercedes , E_S ###SpeakerA87 . 
46964:40	###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###But , uh , I think N_S ###hello , E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###okay , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I got off my pace or my cordless phone , 
46995:34	###SpeakerB132 . ###Wh- , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###the demand is so , high that , uh , you know , they were going *-1 to retail them around like \[ thir- , \+ you know , thirteen \] standard , you know , E_S ###and you get your options , you 're looking at fifteen or \[ si- , \+ fifteen \] E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###SpeakerA135 . ###That 's true . E_S 
47022:19	###but so , that 's MUMBLEx , N_S ###I mean , I would think 0 somebody would try *-1 to compete with that because it is very popular , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###But , N_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###Have you seen the new , uh , Dodge Stealth ? \[ The , \+ the , \] real nice one . E_S 
47118:22	###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , \[ there , \+ there \] are quite a few , um , \[ parks , \+ I guess , state parks , \] E_S ###and there 's a couple of national parks , I guess 0 *T*-2 , that you can camp at *T*-1 .

47158:4	###SpeakerB16 . ###Oh , I 've been camping for years , not on a regular basis E_S ###but , uh , I first started *-1 camping out in the desert in California .

E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###and , uh , then I moved to North Carolina E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I \] did n't camp for a long time , E_S ###and then I started *-1 to , uh , go *-2 camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting , E_S ###so , I 'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting . E_S 
47184:17	###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh , well , \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ uh , in terms of north , south I would say 0 it 's , \] uh , \[ a little , \+ a little \] more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###So what i- , N_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Are you kind of away from the Blue Ridge Mountains , E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Well , \[ it , \+ it 's , \] uh , N_S 
47219:33	###SpeakerB36 . ###I think 0 there 's quite a few . E_S ###I ca n't say 0 I 've checked them all out though . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###\[ What , \+ what 's \] it *EXP*-2 like *T*-1 * camping in the desert and California , E_S ###that seems , like a challenge .

E_S ###You know , you really can probably count thousands of stars , E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
47239:38	###you know , they hear desert E_S ###and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and * being real dry , and lack of water , E_S ###course it , it has all of those qualities E_S ###but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just do n't find *T*-1 anyway else except in a desert . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###So , it 's pretty nice . E_S ###\[ The , \+ uh , the \] movie , THE DOORS , has \[ so- , \+ some \] nice desert scenes , E_S ###those guys all go *-1 camping out in the desert . E_S 
47267:76	###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###I 've been camping in Death Valley , E_S ###one does n't go in July . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah , E_S ###true . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###But it 's beautiful in February . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Um , \[ last , \+ like a few \] summers ago I kept two children every day for the entire summer E_S ###and , I mean , they became like my children . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###I 'd think so . E_S 
47885:4	###SpeakerA15 . ###Not much at all . E_S ###I mean , I would get there at eight o'clock in the morning , E_S ###the children usually were n't awake by then . E_S ###And she would get home at like five thirty in the afternoon . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###And they would have dinner E_S ###and then it was time for them to go to bed . E_S 
47919:34	###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S ###MUMBLEx you say 0 \[ your , \+ you go \] to school ? E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###I go to L S U . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###And what are you studying *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh , communications . E_S 
47927:6	###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh , communications . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Well , * sounds like you 're getting a lot of experience in communicating with children . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###I mean , I love children . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
47939:10	###And I do n't , N_S ###\[ it would , \+ I think 0 it was \] very beneficial to us . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###I mean , like in the summer we were always in the library programs *-1 reading books E_S ###and we went *-1 skating a lot E_S ###and , you know , she was just always there for us , E_S ###but nowadays if there are two parents to a family , the mother works just as hard as the father does , E_S ###and the children either stay at home and get into trouble E_S 
47954:7	###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###But now I realize that it was better because , um , they have got into a lot of trouble , because of lack of supervision . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
47971:10	###SpeakerA43 . ###Well , I 'm majoring in , uh , public relations . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Public relations , E_S ###\[ so , \+ so , \] you would have a job with a company ? Rather than , uh , radio or television or newspapers or , what have you *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yes , ma'am . E_S 
47976:76	###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yes , ma'am . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . 
47996:19	###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###and in that case then \[ I 'll be , \+ I 'll be \] at home when my children are at home *T*-1 , E_S ###but I 'd like *-1 to stay at home with them until they get \[ in , \+ at least into \] kindergarten , where they 're at school from what , eight to three or something *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
48003:55	###but I 'd like *-1 to stay at home with them until they get \[ in , \+ at least into \] kindergarten , where they 're at school from what , eight to three or something *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###and then I would be at my school , *-1 teaching . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh , E_S 
48004:77	###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###and then I would be at my school , *-1 teaching . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S 
48034:4	###SpeakerB74 . ###I taught physical education . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Oh , oh , I started out as a P E major , in education . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###I wanted *-1 to be a P E teacher . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Well , N_S 
48069:92	###SpeakerA89 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###SpeakerA91 . ###SpeakerB92 . ###and I would n't have checked on him . E_S ###However , uh , \[ there are , \+ there are , \] points both directions in that , uh , from the standpoint of parents working and not working . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . 
48080:47	###I 'm working two jobs , E_S ###they each have their own television , E_S ###they each have their own telephone , E_S ###they each have their own rooms , E_S ###they each have this , E_S ###they each have that . E_S ###I 'd say , but what they do n't have *T*-1 is you . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###That 's right . E_S ###They need some attention . E_S 
48087:19	###SpeakerA95 . ###That 's right . E_S ###They need some attention . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Absolutely . E_S ###And , uh , I think out N_S ###because that is the way of * getting attention . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Well , see whenever my Mom stayed home with us *T*-1 , we did without a lot , E_S ###I mean , we were , N_S 
48096:13	###I mean , we were , N_S ###it *EXP*-1 's hard * to make it on one income , E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###but we did E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] we lived in a trailer for eighteen years . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . 
48143:45	###And , that is just as valuable *ICH*-1 , at that time , as to the rush in the elementary . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###It is *?* . Because all the peer pressure , it starts in high school E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###SpeakerA119 . ###SpeakerB120 . ###Yes , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###and the parent really needs *-1 to be there for the child . E_S 
48167:72	###And a thing such as , uh , N_S ###one of the biggest complaints 0 I well remember *T*-1 because I spent a lot of time with seniors , uh , was , um , * carrying their MUMBLEx E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###SpeakerB128 . ###when I was your age *T*-1 I did n't have this or that , E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###and \[ I know \+ 0 I never ever said that because I knew \] that that was one thing that *T*-1 was really irritating to young people . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . 
48172:5	###SpeakerA129 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###and \[ I know \+ 0 I never ever said that because I knew \] that that was one thing that *T*-1 was really irritating to young people . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###Well , I guess 0 that was good that \[ you were , \+ you were \] hearing it from other students . E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###Yes , E_S ###and I had *-1 to deal with their problems E_S ###and I could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing *T*-1 that they had *T*-2 just in general aspect E_S 
48182:32	###and our son would share this E_S ###and then he would have *-1 to make decisions for himself along those same types \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , lines . So that , I think 0 he benefited from my experiences . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###Well , um , N_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###SpeakerA135 . ###Does your son work for T I ? E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerA137 . 
48209:7	###and , uh , we had told him that if he ever wanted *-1 to go to college he could go , E_S ###if he got married *-1 he was on his own , E_S ###if he flunked out he was on his own ... E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , Stephanie , what 's your position on gun control *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , on a scale of one to ten , uh , being *ICH*-1 ten , no , kind of legislation and zero being , uh , total ban , I probably would lean more towards six or seven . E_S ###Um , I feel like a total ban on guns is just going *-1 to put the guns in the hands the criminals . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
48214:14	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , on a scale of one to ten , uh , being *ICH*-1 ten , no , kind of legislation and zero being , uh , total ban , I probably would lean more towards six or seven . E_S ###Um , I feel like a total ban on guns is just going *-1 to put the guns in the hands the criminals . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Um , I lived in Massachusetts for two years E_S ###and they have a total ban on guns E_S ###and I saw that , it did n't stop crime in that state . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
48252:70	###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature , uh , E_S you know , ###you should n't be able *-1 to go out there and just buy one \[ and , \+ \] you know , right off the shelf . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] agree with that . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###\[ And \+ but , \] N_S 
48264:67	###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###\[ I think that , \+ I think that \] the , N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And , so , I think 0 that kind of control \[ is , \+ would be \] good , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . 
48276:54	###and \[ I , \+ I \] know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true , uh , E_S ###only the guns were in the hands of the criminals , E_S ###but how many times , N_S ###I guess 0 I have never heard of \[ a , \+ a \] robbery being foiled *-1 or spoiled *-1 because the person who *T*-2 's being robbed *-3 had a gun . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Um , I , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###And maybe they just do n't report those E_S ###or I 'm not sure E_S ###or , you know , I ca n't think of *-1 ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who *T*-2 was being robbed *-3 E_S 
48280:79	###SpeakerB24 . ###Um , I , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###And maybe they just do n't report those E_S ###or I 'm not sure E_S ###or , you know , I ca n't think of *-1 ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who *T*-2 was being robbed *-3 E_S ###but good thing 0 they had their gun on them E_S ###and \[ they , \+ they \] thwarted the robbery attempt . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah , E_S 
48286:71	###but good thing 0 they had their gun on them E_S ###and \[ they , \+ they \] thwarted the robbery attempt . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] not really sure , E_S ###\[ I do n't , \+ personally I do n't \] own a gun , E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh .

48296:72	###\[ and I think 0 it 's good that everyb- , \+ and I think 0 everybody \] should learn how *-2 to handle one *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Um , you just never know when you might come into contact with one *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###True . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
48297:67	###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Um , you just never know when you might come into contact with one *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###True . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###\[ \[ Did , \+ did you , \] \+ were you \] brought up in a family that *T*-1 hunted E_S 
48301:22	###SpeakerA31 . ###True . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###\[ \[ Did , \+ did you , \] \+ were you \] brought up in a family that *T*-1 hunted E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###No . E_S ###Uh , nobody in my family hunted , E_S 
48312:36	###We lived in New Hampshire at the time . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###How about that . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###And he lived in Massachusetts and had *-1 to get rid *-2 of all his guns , E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###so we ended up , uh , with these guns , E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
48312:80	###We lived in New Hampshire at the time . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###How about that . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###And he lived in Massachusetts and had *-1 to get rid *-2 of all his guns , E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###so we ended up , uh , with these guns , E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
48325:64	###and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb ###and blood squirted everywhere . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Oh , jeez . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###And so that was really the only experience *ICH*-2 that I 've had *T*-1 with guns E_S ###and \[ it , \+ it \] kind of scared me . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
48339:27	###SpeakerA47 . ###Right . E_S ###I 've also always thought about the idea 0 , you know , most sports , you know , which *T*-1 are ###the N R A and people have their thing , you know , N_S 0 if you ban guns , you 're just banning \[ the , \+ the \] recreation , the sport of hunting , things of that nature . E_S ###Most of that 's done *-1 with rifles and such . Uh , though there 's , you know , probably I 'm sure 0 *T*-3 some sector that *T*-2 does it with handguns . E_S ###But just by the mere fact of * outlawing handguns , would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous , E_S ###you could n't be inconspicuous , when you walked into a store stuff like that *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . 
48342:62	###the N R A and people have their thing , you know , N_S 0 if you ban guns , you 're just banning \[ the , \+ the \] recreation , the sport of hunting , things of that nature .

E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###you could see someone coming or dressed *-1 inappropriately , you know , E_S ###\[ you- , \+ \] if they had *-1 to have a rifle or was , N_S you know , ###* made it more difficult * to get \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ uh , a \] handgun .

48346:21	###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###you could see someone coming or dressed *-1 inappropriately , you know , E_S ###\[ you- , \+ \] if they had *-1 to have a rifle or was , N_S you know , ###* made it more difficult * to get \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ uh , a \] handgun . N_S ###Now of course , you know , in this world anytime 0 you 've freedom *T*-1 you can be able *-2 to get anything 0 you want *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S 
48358:43	###I do n't know if that 's a large percentage of , uh , crime or not E_S ###but I guess 0 it would be some . E_S ###But \[ I , \+ I \] think definitely , N_S ###like today they just introduced \[ the , \+ \] what *T*-1 's called *-2 the Brady bill . The seven day mandatory waiting period , on * getting any guns . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###And I think \[ that , \+ Shoot that 's \] a good idea . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###I would definitely support that . E_S 
48362:36	###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###And I think \[ that , \+ Shoot that 's \] a good idea . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###I would definitely support that . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] agree 0 the thing *ICH*-2 that *T*-1 scares me , uh , though about where \[ I would , \+ I would \] \[ wa- , \+ definitely want \] some sort of legislation *T*-3 E_S 
48422:33	###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's what , N_S ###when this subject was mentioned *-1 to us *T*-3 I said , well , E_S I went , gee , that 's all 0 I use mine for *T*-2 is a word processor , E_S ###and I have n't used it since I got out of college , E_S ###and that was six years ago , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Oh , wow . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###but \[ it , \+ it \] was my sister 's who , N_S 
48426:5	###and I have n't used it since I got out of college , E_S ###and that was six years ago , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Oh , wow . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###but \[ it , \+ it \] was my sister 's who , N_S ###my sister bought it E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
48466:38	###What kind do you have *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Um , it 's an I B M , E_S ###I think 0 it 's a Professional Three Hundred , E_S ###no , E_S ###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] the digital one . E_S ###It 's an , uh , I B M P C Junior , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Oh , well , that 's a nice computer . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . 
48467:4	###SpeakerA21 . ###Um , it 's an I B M , E_S ###I think 0 it 's a Professional Three Hundred , E_S ###no , E_S ###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] the digital one . E_S ###It 's an , uh , I B M P C Junior , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Oh , well , that 's a nice computer . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah E_S 
48502:74	###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###but , um , I also am sponsoring a literary magazine , E_S ###and we 're doing our entire layout on the computer , uh , because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have *T*-1 , a publishing program . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] neat , E_S 
48568:20	###they just went through a course , uh , and took the electronic grafting course , drafting , not grafting , but drafting course , E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Oh , that 's , fascinating . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA65 . 
48581:11	###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and that 's really neat , E_S ###I mean , yeah , E_S ###you can do \[ graphs , \+ graphs \] on it too , E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###but \[ this is , \+ you know , this is \] one step above it , E_S 
48601:13	###you have *-1 to be so precise . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and the computer does it all for you . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###So it was really neat . E_S ###I wanted *-1 to go to that course , E_S ###but my boss would n't pay for it , E_S 
48650:42	###SpeakerB92 . ###Well , they vary tremendously . E_S ###Um , because you can get N_S ###because \[ you 're , \+ they 're , \] uh , N_S ###the ones that *T*-1 were made *-2 a few years ago , uh , have come down in price significantly , um , E_S ###\[ you can get them , \+ I 've seen them \] for five , and six hundred dollars , E_S ###but they 're much less , um , have much less memory , and capable , of much less . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Yeah , E_S ###they ca n't do \[ your , \+ um , your \] drafting and your graphs , and all of that . E_S 
48683:53	###SpeakerA103 . ###\[ You do run in- , \+ you do run into \] limitations on yours ? E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###SpeakerA105 . ###SpeakerB106 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Oh , wow . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###uh-huh , E_S 
48699:29	###SpeakerA111 . ###Wow , that 's neat that \[ you ev- , \+ you even \] reach the limits of yours . E_S ###I have n't even begun *-1 to reach the limits , E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###No , E_S ###but I , N_S ###mine is not as good as a P C , uh , uh , Junior , E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###Junior , E_S ###yeah . E_S 
48746:47	###SpeakerB128 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###SpeakerB130 . ###And she could have bought a typewriter also . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###Yeah , E_S ###a typewriter with memory \[ would , \+ would \] have been fine , E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###Yeah , E_S 
48780:4	###Did you use Word Perfect ? E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###Um , no , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] really do n't , N_S ###\[ it 's , \+ it was \] six years ago . E_S ###SpeakerB142 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###She pretty much set it up . E_S ###She goes , here , \[ this is , \+ \] you make your file , 
48830:19	###I know that they , uh , have capital punishment for certain crimes , E_S ###and that 's probably the way 0 I feel *T*-4 about it \[ is , \+ is , \] uh , it kind of depends on the crime that *T*-2 's committed *-3 . E_S ###My belief all my life , I guess 0 *T*-1 , has been \[ that , \+ that \] if you take someone else 's life , then you automatically are giving up , uh , yours in place of it . E_S ###But I do n't , N_S ###* seems *-1 to be a lot of controversy about that . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , uh , I tend *-1 to agree with you , uh , you know , E_S 
48844:113	###SpeakerA5 . ###That 's true . E_S I guess 0 *T*-1 , ###well , \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] probably two or three different types \[ of , \+ of \] views as far as the controversy goes . E_S ###I can see where if a life was taken *-1 by accident or , uh , I do n't know what you 'd call it *T*-2 , not premeditated or , I guess primarily by accident , , uh *T*-5 , there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for *-3 *T*-4 , E_S ###but I lean towards , ###if it 's premeditated or if it 's , uh , kind of a habitual \[ or , \+ or \] \[ a habit that , \+ uh , a tendency that \] people , uh , may get into *T*-1 , then I guess 0 I do n't really have a problem with it .

49447:4	###SpeakerA24 . ###I had a Buick Regal . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###Did you ? E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###I had , uh , a Mazda R X Seven before that E_S ###and that was the worse car 0 I 've ever driven *T*-1 in my life . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . 
49464:84	###SpeakerB31 . ###Really ?

49588:16	###SpeakerA78 . ###I was n't even looking for a car when I bought this car *T*-1 .

49792:29	###SpeakerB29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###SpeakerB31 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###And , uh , uh , unfortunately , of course , the Cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA34 . 
49811:21	###SpeakerA36 . ###That 's right .

49828:13	###SpeakerB43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###And , um , they 'd go after them *-1 saying , uh , jeez what you really need *T*-2 is a defensive end .

49881:4	###\[ \[ They gave up , \+ they , \] \+ they traded \] \[ Wa- , \+ Herschel , \] to Minnesota . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###They traded Walker , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Yeah , E_S ###okay . E_S ###My brain is really working well tonight . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###That 's okay , E_S

51363:26	###I mean , I 've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###Yeah , E_S ###* hope 0 I 'm going *-1 to do it this year because , um , uh , *-2 having a kid this fall , E_S ###so it 's like so much for * going to lots of baseball games .

51567:8	###SpeakerA65 . ###Well , I checked a lot of places *ICH*-1 out , you know , the Kinder Cares and the , stuff like that . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . ###Yeah .

51609:54	###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah .

51630:30	###SpeakerB92 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###But , she seems to me *-1 to be , you know , pretty quick and smart E_S ###and she 's already reading and writing and stuff , like that .

51740:69	###SpeakerB140 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###SpeakerB142 . ###That 's right . E_S ###I think 0 that 's an ideal situation . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###Because you do n't know , uh , N_S ###because like at her school , um , as soon as you drive up it 's got like a circular type drive . E_S ###They sit E_S 
51762:50	###SpeakerB148 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###But now that I 'm there , I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a lot more convenient because there 's so many kids that *T*-1 doddle .

52305:29	###Nobody had ever touched it before . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###Yeah .

52358:22	###SpeakerA118 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB119 . ###No E_S ###it does n't , E_S ###SpeakerA120 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB121 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerA122 . 
52405:8	###anyway . N_S ###Um , oh , there was another one , E_S ###what *T*-2 's the one that *T*-1 just , N_S ###oh , DANCES WITH WOLVES , have you seen that yet ? E_S ###SpeakerA134 . ###No , E_S ###I have n't * . E_S ###SpeakerB135 . ###Oh , you 've got *-1 to see that one , E_S ###it 's really , N_S

E_S ###SpeakerB137 . 
52428:16	###SpeakerA140 . ###Well my wife , uh , has got \[ a , \+ uh , a \] picture from Kevin Costner E_S ###and he signed it . E_S ###It 's from DANCES WITH WOLVES .

52493:26	###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###So , it *EXP*-1 really bothers me that there 's not a way of * getting him out of the way forever . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Really , E_S ###I think that , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S 
52504:62	###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###I think 0 it 'll only make them worse , E_S ###but , \[ I , \+ I \] believe that God can come in and change a person 's heart and genuinely change it , E_S ###but , that does n't negate that you do reap what you sow *T*-1 .

55800:4	###SpeakerB142 . ###Um , I get bored very easily . E_S ###Uh , the one nice thing about the bicycle is 0 you just sit .

E_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###With the stepper , you are conscious of what you are doing *T*-1 because you 're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###Huh . E_S

55952:75	###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh .

55972:154	###SpeakerA49 . ###Oh , that would , be a nightmare . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###And \[ just , \+ I mean , just \] * \[ getting , \+ getting \] it going . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB54 .

E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###So there 's a good combination in the hallways all the time , you know . E_S 
57185:24	###But , uh , he goes to work in his blue jeans , t-shirt , and tennis shoes , E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###and he just loves it . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###And that 's very acceptable at T I . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
57198:11	###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###\[ I wo- , \+ I would \] hate *-1 to be in that atmosphere .

E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
57243:52	###SpeakerA49 . ###The , N_S ###no , E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###I think 0 that 's great . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah , E_S 
57267:34	###I used *-1 to smoke a long time ago . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###I think 0 that 's , um , N_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###I used *-1 to burn my clothes , * talking about * getting back to clothes . E_S ###I used *-1 to burn my clothes with cigarettes . E_S ###That 's one of the reason that I stopped *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Well , um , \[ y- , \+ you \] mentioned 0 your daughter had graduated from college . E_S ###Well when she was in high school *T*-2 did she always have *-1 to have all the new fashions E_S 
57277:8	###and , uh ? N_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ she always had , \+ uh , yeah , she always had \] *-1 to have a lot of clothes .

57283:34	###but my mamma was not raised *-1 like that E_S ###and so , N_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###No , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] was n't *?* *-1 either , E_S ###\[ she , \+ my daughter , \] she 's real good at *-1 finding sales though , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Oh , me to , E_S ###boy I have *-1 to , hunt them down . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . 
57301:32	###but now \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] learned how *-1 to sew *T*-2 , E_S ###so \[ \[ I 'm , \+ well I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] still learning how , E_S ###\[ but I 'm ge- , \+ and I 'm getting \] much better at it E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I 'm \] going *-1 to be able *-2 to make my own clothes .

57391:39	###SpeakerA101 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###So \[ that , \+ that \] has a lot * to do with it . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###But , um , N_S ###well , N_S ###SpeakerA105 . 
57420:50	###SpeakerB112 . ###Uh , oh . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###\[ There was , \+ in the middle of the back of it , there was , \] N_S ###it 's like there , N_S ###it had been slit *-1 E_S ###and they had like just sewed it back together , right in the middle of the back , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Oh , no .

57435:13	###\[ but , \+ but \] still , \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] really \[ \[ not , \+ not , \] \+ not \] a good quality .

E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###The defect . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###um , they do n't really buy the first quality , E_S 
57462:16	###the \] last thing 0 I 've done *T*-1 as far as car repairs go \[ is , \+ is \] * change oil and filter \[ an , \+ and \] that kind of stuff . E_S ###I have n't gotten really involved in anything , uh , extensive in car repairs in , oh , oh , probably a year or so . E_S ###I think 0 the last thing 0 I did *T*-1 of any significance was * change the water pump on an Oldsmobile . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I had a similar thing , that I 've worked on cars ever since I was , uh , a kid . E_S ###And that was some time ago , E_S ###but I 've gotten to the point where , uh , the newer cars are getting so complicated 0 * to work on *T*-1 that , uh , oh , most of the cars N_S ###\[ I buy , \+ I try *-1 to buy \] as simple a car as possible . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . 
57470:25	###\[ I buy , \+ I try *-1 to buy \] as simple a car as possible . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###So , you know , * changing the oil , changing the spark plugs N_S ###and most of them now , you know , you do n't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that 's all solid state \[ or , \+ or \] fuel injected E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###or fuel injected , E_S 
57474:11	###SpeakerB4 . ###So , you know , * changing the oil , changing the spark plugs N_S ###and most of them now , you know , you do n't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that 's all solid state \[ or , \+ or \] fuel injected E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###or fuel injected , E_S ###and so there 's , N_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###so there goes the carburetor E_S ###and if the fuel injection system breaks down , there 's no way in the world 0 you 're going *-1 to work on that *T*-2 . E_S 
57493:18	###and I said 0 that means that I ca n't work on it . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###basically that 's it . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###You know , they 've gotten so complicated or so high tech that , uh , \[ the guys , \+ average guys \] ca n't really go out \[ in the , \+ in the \] garage and do a whole lot of repairs , ###uh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah , E_S 
57544:27	###SpeakerA27 . ###Well that 's kind of the way 0 I was *T*-1 , E_S ###I tried *-1 to remember *ICH*-3 as I took stuff off where it went *T*-2 , E_S ###and I do n't think 0 I had too many nuts and bolts left * over when I got it all put *-1 back together *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###A few years ago I had an Oldsmobile diesel E_S ###and , uh , the , N_S ###uh , it , N_S ###after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump *ICH*-1 went out on it .

57548:50	###SpeakerB28 . ###A few years ago I had an Oldsmobile diesel E_S ###and , uh , the , N_S ###uh , it , N_S ###after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump *ICH*-1 went out on it .

57554:23	###when I came back here *T*-1 , I brought the car back here E_S ###and , uh , I do n't know , ###diesels got pretty unpopular E_S ###and you could n't sell the thi- , N_S ###I mean , though for what you could get *T*-1 for one , you might as well drive it over a cliff . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Oh , yeah . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And , uh , the injector pump went bad E_S 
57555:5	###and , uh , I do n't know , ###diesels got pretty unpopular E_S ###and you could n't sell the thi- , N_S ###I mean , though for what you could get *T*-1 for one , you might as well drive it over a cliff . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Oh , yeah . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And , uh , the injector pump went bad E_S ###so I found a outfit down here 0 *T*-1 to rebuild it .

57559:21	###SpeakerA29 . ###Oh , yeah . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And , uh , the injector pump went bad E_S ###so I found a outfit down here 0 *T*-1 to rebuild it .

57570:29	###SpeakerB34 . ###Oh , well , \[ it , \+ you know , i- , \] N_S ###diesels do n't require mechanics , E_S ###they require plumbers . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Well that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###And , uh , . N_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###I think 0 the \[ onl- , \+ closest \] thing 0 I 've come *T*-2 \[ to , \+ to \] a diesel is , 0 I 've worked for a tractor repair shop , uh , when I was in high school *T*-1 E_S 
57580:114	###and , uh , we used *-1 to overhaul farm tractors basically , E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###and they were nearly \[ all , \+ all \] diesel , E_S ###but as far as cars I 've never , never been involved with them . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Well the injector nozzle and stuff in , you know , the big diesel farm tractors , you know , what *T*-1 are about the size of your thumb , E_S and the- , N_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Well , \[ ye- , \+ yeah , \] E_S 
57588:62	###SpeakerA41 . ###Well , \[ ye- , \+ yeah , \] E_S ###and \[ you ca- , \+ you can \] get to them . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###yeah E_S ###you can get to them , E_S ###and the ones \[ in , \+ in \] the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible 0 * to do anything with *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Well I , N_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
57612:54	###I su- , N_S ###I do n't know if it 's still , uh , limited like it was *?* , E_S ###I do n't notice it , probably because I don- , N_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###What , E_S ###the availability ? E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Huh ? E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###You mean the diesel availability ? E_S 
57631:30	###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###and it was the van that I needed *T*-1 then , *-2 to buy the , you know , N_S ###* traded it in on the Chevy van . E_S ###But , uh , * sure enjoyed it . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###But \[ yo- , \+ you \] got \[ the , \+ the \] three fifty in the van ? E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah , E_S 
57646:11	###and , uh , if you treat them right , they 're not the gas guzzlers 0 I think that they 've got the reputation * to be *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###I 'm convinced that , uh , Detroit or whoever it is *T*-1 made a major mistake , years ago when they stopped *-2 putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah E_S ###co- , N_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###SpeakerB62 . 
57651:31	###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah E_S ###co- , N_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S 
57669:43	###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Little , you know , not whole lot more \[ \[ than the , \+ than the , \] \+ than the \] six cylinder that I think 0 *T*-1 was like about two thirty-five or so . N_S ###But , uh , they kept *-1 boring that block out to where you could a get a \[ four hundred , \+ small block four hundred \] that *T*-2 was , uh , the same block *T*-3 , you know , \[ just , \+ just \] kept *-1 boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more , an . N_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###I think 0 \[ those gu- , \+ those little \] V eights could have been made *-1 to be pretty powerful little engines , if they would have gone with it , E_S ###but .

E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###The two little cars 0 I 've got *T*-1 now , N_S 
57714:39	###SpeakerB84 . ###The friend of ours over here , he 's got , uh , sixty-five , or sixty-six Mustang the six cylinder . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###And , uh , I was look under the hood of that the other day E_S ###and like you say , you can see the road . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . 
57727:52	###SpeakerB90 . ###\[ You coul- , \+ yeah , you could \] stand in there if you really wanted *-1 to *?* , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###My dad 's got a new , um , N_S ###I guess 0 it 's an eighty-nine or ninety , uh , Chrysler something or other . E_S ###It 's one of those transverse mounted V sixes , front wheel drive . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###And , uh , he was showing it to me E_S 
57741:16	###SpeakerB94 . ###SpeakerA95 . ###And he 'd never really thought about it . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###And he says well , hopefully I wo n't have *-1 to change them , before I trade it off . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's going *-1 to be a problem * getting back there because it was shoved *-2 right up against the fire wall . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . 
57757:9	###like well , actually , I guess 0 *T*-1 , her- , N_S ###within a couple of years ago anyway was the last 0 I 've paid any attention to it *T*-1 .

57757:61	###like well , actually , I guess 0 *T*-1 , her- , N_S ###within a couple of years ago anyway was the last 0 I 've paid any attention to it *T*-1 .

57797:43	###SpeakerB116 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###And , uh , I had *-1 to struggle with that for a while *-1 to figure which belt *T*-2 goes where . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's kind of like the inside dual on a truck . E_S ###You know , when one of them breaks *T*-1 , it 's not the outside one , E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###Oh man . E_S 
57801:54	###SpeakerB118 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's kind of like the inside dual on a truck .

57820:5	###Is this , N_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Uh , I 've got , uh , five stickers *ICH*-1 here from T I , E_S ###so I guess 0 I 've done probably , uh , I 'd say seven or eight of them .

E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###Yeah , E_S 
57859:93	###SpeakerB2 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Um , * looking back , like maybe some of the things that I know *T*-1 now , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] not sure 0 I do believe 0 it was worth the cost in dollars and lives . E_S ###That was one of the questions that she asked us *-1 to think about *T*-2 , E_S ###\[ because I , \+ because we \] never went to war . E_S ###I do n't think 0 we were committed to * winning it and getting out E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I \] feel like it went on and on . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Right . E_S 
57871:87	###SpeakerB6 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###You know , I just feel like maybe we went in *-1 to be policeman E_S ###and I 'm not sure 0 that 's our role , E_S ###but .

57890:28	###I mean I do think that , \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ it 's \] been too long in * coming E_S ###but I feel like maybe the American people \[ and , \+ and \] the government are aware of the things that we did *T*-1 wrong that we did n't support \[ \[ that , \+ that \] \+ those , \] E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###so many people were opposed to the war , E_S ###what it translated into *T*-1 was 0 they were opposed to the folks that *T*-3 were there *-4 fighting it E_S ###and those guys were there *-1 doing their duty .

57897:5	###and those guys were there *-1 doing their duty .

E_S ###It was a tragic mistake , E_S 
57935:42	###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###And then he has backed out , E_S ###he has pulled out .

58200:24	###Uh , do you , uh , find it useable ? E_S ###Have you tried much with it ?

58217:71	###SpeakerA9 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh , it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it 's all decimal . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###And it *EXP*-1 's so easy * to convert from one set of units to another . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh , E_S 
58230:55	###\[ and , \+ uh , so \] \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] lived with MUMBLEx pounds and inches and found it *EXP*-1 really quite easy * to convert over .

E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###SpeakerB16 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###and , I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 hung people up the most is 0 they went now * wait a minute , ###an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters , E_S 
58239:26	###an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###how on earth am I every going *-1 to do the math *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And the problem is that we tried *-1 to convert everything from inches to centimeters * preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than * saying no , a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail , or whatever , \[ and , \+ you know , and \] leaving it at that E_S ###and , uh , you know , a kilogram weighs about this much E_S 
58244:4	###SpeakerB20 . ###Right .

E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
58256:115	###people , you know , N_S ###it *EXP*-1 's hard * to take it seriously . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###And as long as both were given *-1 , you , basically , just do n't read the kilometers per hour , E_S ###you just say , well look * read the miles per hour one , E_S ###the other one must be for someone else . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###That 's right . E_S 
58277:16	###except I think , that they probably just said well , we 're just going *-1 to start *-2 using the things now E_S ###and you sort of have *-1 to force people to change since they do n't want *-2 to . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Of course , * being part of the European community , if everybody else did it \[ they , \+ they \] were probably much more , N_S ###* is much more necessary for them than for us . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###That 's true , E_S ###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] probably true E_S ###and America does have a long history of * sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting , you know , some other model . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
58323:21	###I did n't mean , you know , I did n't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything , you know , E_S ###at midnight , tonight we all switch over or anything . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Did they switch ? E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh , I believe so , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###and I think 0 they did it overnight E_S ###cause you know , you ca n't do it gradually .

58488:49	###Or are you not at that stage yet ? E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it does . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###We try our hardest *-3 to get them to eat what we , \[ w- , \+ \] eat *T*-2 , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Right . E_S

58532:4	###SpeakerB43 . ###SpeakerA44 . ###Oh really . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###it has a French name , E_S ###it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese , cream sauce with it E_S ###and you pour it over rice , E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###Oh yeah , E_S ###\[ what 's , \+ what is \] that *T*-1 , 
58542:20	###Saint Jack or something . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###Yeah , uh . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###Scallops Saint something , E_S ###or , yeah , MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I ca n't even remember what the recipe 's name is *T*-1 anymore , E_S ###SpeakerA50 . 
58551:19	###SpeakerA50 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###but , uh , \[ i- , \+ it \] was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then , uh , standard cream sauce base and then , uh the scallops .

58592:26	###and that kind of interrupted the game , E_S ###\[ so , \+ so \] I was thinking 0 there 's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I 've tried *T*-1 before that *T*-2 's pretty good E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###and then you can make that ahead E_S ###and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you 're ready . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
58645:18	###SpeakerA84 . ###Oh , gosh , E_S ###so do you , N_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###Course , she grew up * Catholic E_S ###so you know , \[ they , \+ they \] sort of come with the , N_S ###SpeakerA86 . ###Oh , they did the , N_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###there 's a certain amount of meatless meals 0 you have *-1 to have *T*-2 .

58758:18	###SpeakerB117 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA118 . ###\[ And , um , so \+ \] I can make a pretty mean pie , E_S ###but , um , I do n't do it anymore because it 's just too fattening .

58968:49	###SpeakerB10 . ###\[ Ye- , \+ yeah . \] E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###I mean , \[ i- , \+ it \] really is coming to that because most women now days can not afford the time that they could take *T*-1 off unless the company pays them .

59038:40	###SpeakerB36 . ###Yea- , E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Because I work now , E_S ###I work full time E_S ###and , uh , you know , it , N_S ###when you put them through college *T*-1 it just takes just about everything 0 you got *T*-2 . E_S 
59048:5	###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###They get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that , E_S ###that helps out , E_S ###but still , it cost a lot .

62368:11	###and yes E_S ###we had *-1 to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey *-2 \[ to get , \+ to meet \] these people . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###And so we went there , E_S ###we told them about the stuff E_S ###and the guy said , uh , that the computer would fit our needs .

62387:13	###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh .

62424:41	###They probably did n't know what they were talking about *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Right . E_S ###That 's completely it . E_S ###The salesman did n't know .

E_S ###SpeakerA53 . 
62434:29	###SpeakerA53 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Okay . E_S ###So they did that .

62459:60	###SpeakerA59 . ###Oh , jeez . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###And see now we 're dealing with * having *-1 to bring it back again E_S ###and they say 0 they can , you know , do something different and change some connectors E_S ###and we hope so , E_S ###but it 's a hassle .

62780:38	###SpeakerA9 . ###I agree .

E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###\[ I , \+ I 'd \] heard something stranger , E_S ###* talk about bottles the other day \[ on , uh , \+ on \] the radio station , I think 0 it 's K L T Y .

E_S 
63811:38	###SpeakerB82 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###You know they 're , N_S ###along that same line , they said 0 they were using , um , N_S ###what is , ###oh , I know , N_S ###it was toilets .

65458:16	###SpeakerB134 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###But I park for free up \[ at , \+ at \] Memorial Stadium because I know where I can do it for free *T*-1 .

65493:81	###SpeakerA151 . ###SpeakerB152 . ###So Arlington 's going *-1 to build a stadium , a bigger one . E_S ###SpeakerA153 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###So \[ we 're going *-4 to , \+ they 're going *-1 to \] stay there . Which *T*-2 is fine , because Arlington 's got a lot of things 0 * to offer *T*-3 .

65527:30	###I 've , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB164 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ \[ We , \+ you know , we , \] \+ I \] like it there .

E_S 
65588:44	###SpeakerA185 . ###SpeakerB186 . ###\[ So , \+ but \] he 's reading it , E_S ###and he 's r- , N_S ###and he says , He 's so interesting , Mom .

65678:118	###In other words , they 're in there for a purpose , E_S ###* put them to work rather than * sitting there . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###It 's the same thing like the whole \[ criminal , \+ I should n't say *RNR*-1 criminal , but the whole police \] department of the United States . E_S ###I feel the same way . E_S ###Uh , someone gets picked *-1 up for drunk driving , E_S he should put enough *ICH*-2 in there that *T*-1 goes back into *-3 paying for that policeman being out there . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
65698:112	###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###it *EXP*-1 's tough * \[ to , \+ to \] say \[ what , \+ uh , you know , what , \] uh , N_S ###as far as this , that good or bad or what .

E_S ###They , N_S ###so , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
65714:11	###But I 'm just saying that even the differences , uh , is that , you know , some countries pay for students to go \[ to , \+ through \] college and etcetera . E_S ###But here , \[ it , \+ you know , it 's \] just up to high school . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah .

66047:52	###SpeakerB75 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###and then \[ they , \+ they \] just ca n't pay for it .

66107:83	###SpeakerA100 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] can do that . E_S ###I believe 0 it costs about ten dollars . E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###* Might be worth it for peace of mind . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###It is *?* , E_S ###it is *?* . E_S 
66128:11	###Or something 0 you have n't paid *T*-1 in sixty days or ninety days , you know . And things like that .

E_S ###SpeakerA108 . ###Do they charge a lot of interest on that card ? E_S ###SpeakerB109 . 
66157:44	###Or there 's a couple of other places that *T*-1 are able *-2 to charge us like twenty-one and twenty-two percent interest .

66165:14	###SpeakerB121 . ###SpeakerA122 . ###And I looked at the credit card agreement one day , E_S ###and it was like twenty-three percent interest . E_S ###SpeakerB123 . ###Holy cow !

66234:15	###* Does n't seem like it 's being carried *-1 out very well in my opinion .

E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S 
66244:11	###Um , I , N_S ###in Maryland \[ they , \+ they \] do have capital punishment , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
66257:11	###I saw a statistic *ICH*-2 just a few days ago , um , 0 so far this \[ ye- , \+ year , \] or was it during the last year , \[ somewh- , \+ during \] a year 's time , I think 0 it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation .

E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###So \[ I , \+ I , \] N_S ###and it 's building up , you know , E_S ###\[ they 're , \+ they 're \] convicting them faster than they 're executing them E_S ###so it 's really building up . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S 
66268:5	###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###And , uh , here in Maryland I know 0 *T*-1 we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons , ###uh , E_S just , N_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###everybody 's got that . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah , E_S

66367:72	###and we are there by going *-1 to remove them from society , not temporarily , but permanently . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah .

66375:21	###the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole .

66451:7	###what *T*-1 was the results there . N_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Oh , he was found *-1 guilty , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Oh .

E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Yeah . E_S 
66494:53	###SpeakerA89 . ###Yeah .

66505:69	###SpeakerB92 . ###Uh-huh .

66523:29	###SpeakerA99 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###And the people 0 I 'd most likely want *-1 to sentence *T*-2 to death are the people that *T*-3 just show a really low regard for human life .

69801:7	###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###The biggest problem \[ with , \+ with \] the weather and the rain in this area is the soil . E_S ###It 's that black clay soil . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . 
69812:15	###okay . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###You know , it 's not sandy like most of the state is *?* , E_S ###so it does n't absorb the water real well . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###You know , once it rains a little bit , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] filled *-1 up ###and everything else just runs off , E_S 
69829:20	###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] a complete mess , ###everything *ICH*-1 floods , all the under passes . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah .

69850:28	###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###\[ And , \+ uh , so \] they 're still talking water rationing this Summer , E_S ###so it would seem strange because in San Antonio , N_S ###we had lived out , um , west of San Antonio , in Castroville , E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###And the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down , that they were considering that they might have *-1 to do water rationing E_S 
69861:77	###and there 's no problem with water . E_S ###And then I came here and found out 0 they were in the , you know , four year draught . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###So I said , well , gee , this is pretty much like Texas . E_S ###And it pretty much is *?* in the middle of Summer . E_S ###They have rolling hills around here E_S ###but , um , they turn to golden dead grass , for the majority of the Summer just because there is no water 0 *T*-1 to keep them green . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . 
69918:5	###SpeakerA103 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###and you do n't have *-1 to worry about the high humidity . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###Does Dallas get high humidity ? E_S ###Or is it pretty dry . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . 
69930:14	###but it 's nothing like , I guess , San Antonio Summers , E_S ###it 's nothing like Houston . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###MUMBLEx or East Texas , is a little more humid . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###Yeah . E_S ###It seems like San Antonio is increasing in humidity over the years , E_S ###because I had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years , E_S 
69965:19	###SpeakerA119 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###It 's just completely different E_S ###and it 's much nicer . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference , E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
69965:49	###SpeakerA119 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###It 's just completely different E_S ###and it 's much nicer . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference , E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
69982:43	###SpeakerA123 . ###That 's nice . E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###So it 's been good . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Well , my wife 's originally from Virginia E_S ###and we lived there for about nine months E_S ###and that was a real change for me . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###Oh , I imagine . E_S 
70008:14	###SpeakerA133 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Their Springs and Summers are pretty mild , too . E_S ###It never gets real , real hot . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I 'll have *-1 to try that out because I had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB136 . 
70020:60	###Because a lot of people that *T*-1 are from that North Carolina region really like it . E_S ###And , uh , they get the snow , E_S ###but they said 0 it does n't really get messy E_S ###and it does n't really hang around that long . E_S ###SpeakerA137 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB138 . ###So , \[ they , \+ the people \] 0 I know *T*-1 that *T*-2 are from there , uh , they always miss it E_S ###and they want *-1 to go back . E_S ###Nothing seems quite as good . E_S 
70054:26	###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA147 . ###Well , I enjoyed *-1 talking with you Lisa , E_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Good luck to you . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###You , too . E_S ###SpeakerB150 . 
70085:4	###SpeakerB6 . ###I live in Houston . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###I see . E_S ###Is that pretty typical for your area ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , for the neighborhood 0 I 'm in *T*-1 , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
70127:63	###SpeakerB16 . ###Well , in the , uh , newer neighborhoods and development communities , the houses are so close together , E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###That 's exactly right . E_S ###That 's the way 0 we are *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ We have , \+ uh , one thing 0 we have *T*-1 \] that we really enjoy *T*-2 here , is we have a hot tub in the back . E_S 
70169:19	###and then you get those Visa bills in . E_S ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###So anyway , um , anything else \[ about the area , \+ about , \] um , N_S ###you know , can you compare yourself to any thing around there . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Most of the neighborhood 0 I 'm in *T*-1 is pretty typical . E_S ###This whole neighborhood was built *-1 between sixty and sixty-five . E_S 
70208:30	###and it seems like N_S ###now \[ that 's , \+ that 's , \] N_S ###I almost wish 0 I was in an apartment or something . You know , E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###It 's rained MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , um , I do n't know , ###do we just terminate this ###or do you have *-1 to talk for a certain amount of time ? E_S 
70316:18	###SpeakerA71 . ###I never have much luck with tomatoes . E_S ###I do plant a lot of beans , because it seems like , the , uh , bugs get on them so easily E_S ###and I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that , E_S ###so , the only thing that I use *T*-1 is soap . E_S ###I water , you know , spray the plants , because they say , 0 supposedly , that will keep the bugs off them . E_S ###But , uh , I do n't have luck with that tomato plant , E_S ###so I hate *-1 to spray them with anything . E_S ###Um , what do you do *T*-1 ? E_S ###Do you have any tips 0 you could give me *T*-1 ? E_S 
70325:9	###Do you have any tips 0 you could give me *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Um , my favorite one is * putting on the , um , tomato plant \[ is * to put , \+ \] uh , MUMBLEx dust , E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time , E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###That 's true . E_S 
70343:5	###SpeakerB76 . ###Well , I 've done some rewiring on it . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Eventually , if we stay here , I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to rewire the entire house . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###Do you plan on like *-1 adding any rooms or , N_S ###you have enough space E_S 
70397:13	###SpeakerB96 . ###We 'll , N_S ###he 's nine months old . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Oh , so he does n't know , right . E_S ###I guess , 0 he 's a big help out in your garden . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###He likes *-1 to dig around a little bit . E_S ###His mother comes in and says , why did you let him play in the dirt *T*-1 , E_S 
70407:24	###SpeakerA99 . ###SpeakerB100 . ###I guess 0 he 's enjoying himself . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###That 's right . E_S ###It 's healthy , E_S ###why not . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###He was eating the dirt , E_S 
70422:27	###and I turned out okay , E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###SpeakerA105 . ###so , * do n't worry about it . E_S ###Just * let him enjoy himself . E_S ###So you think that you want *-1 to move away from the big city , uh ? E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###Well , that 's what I 've always , N_S ###I was raised *-1 up in a town that *T*-2 was about ten thousand people . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . 
70430:16	###I was raised *-1 up in a town that *T*-2 was about ten thousand people . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Yeah . E_S ###So you 're just the opposite from me . E_S ###You want *-1 to go back to that , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###After we got married *-1 we \[ moved , \+ ended up *-2 moving \] to the Houston area . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S 
70469:14	###SpeakerB12 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Well , at the my- , N_S ###I introduced you a little bit to it , a few minutes ago , when I said that \[ we are , \+ uh , we 're \] on the east coast now *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###My husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that , N_S ###well , we both decided 0 we wanted *-1 to move to North Carolina . E_S 
70474:41	###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###My husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that , N_S ###well , we both decided 0 we wanted *-1 to move to North Carolina . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###And so naturally we put ourselves , N_S ###we looked at our budget , E_S 
70488:12	###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And , uh , so , we had *-1 to make some adjustments E_S ###because we really are kind of looking for something that we want *-4 to do *T*-1 and he wants *-2 to do *T*-1 that *T*-3 's satisfactory , E_S ###and we 've been here seven months E_S ###and he 's still has n't hit up on anything permanently . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Oh , no . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . 
70517:14	###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###and then we put that on the computer E_S ###and then we took about three months \[ and , \+ uh , and \] adjusted , where we could come down *T*-1 and where we did n't want *-2 to come down *T*-3 , E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S 
70517:60	###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh .

70522:52	###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###and we really , uh , lessened \[ it , \+ uh , our living expenses , \] uh , more than what we thought 0 we would *?* *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Wow , that 's great . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
70522:74	###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah .

70529:64	###SpeakerB40 . ###Wow , that 's great . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Did you have a special program on your computer 0 * to do that *T*-1 E_S ###or was this just your own design of , N_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Oh , just our own design . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
70547:41	###of N_S ###our first fifteen years or eighteen years of * being married nothing worked . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###We spent too much money , until our children went to college , E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###\[ so . \+ So , \] * tell me about , N_S 
70568:62	###and we were just , you know , dirt poor . E_S ###Then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage *T*-1 we decided 0 we 'd bank my salary so we could buy a house . E_S ###So , we virtually did that for about two years , which *T*-1 worked real well , and then moved from California where we realized 0 we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved *T*-2 *T*-6 , and moved to Texas , bought a house *ICH*-5 immediately , you know , which *T*-3 , of course , is now devalued *-4 with the housing market , E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Wonderful . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###so , I do n't know if \[ we , \+ we \] did a good thing * to buy a house *T*-1 or not E_S 
70570:8	###So , we virtually did that for about two years , which *T*-1 worked real well , and then moved from California where we realized 0 we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved *T*-2 *T*-6 , and moved to Texas , bought a house *ICH*-5 immediately , you know , which *T*-3 , of course , is now devalued *-4 with the housing market , E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Wonderful .

70571:35	###SpeakerA55 . ###Wonderful . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yes .

70594:61	###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And we really do n't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all , E_S ###but it seems like there 's , um , times when we just have *-1 to get out *T*-3 where we 'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we 'll go and we 'll blow , you know , fifty , sixty dollars in one night * going out *-2 to eat , going to a show or doing something *T*-4 , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Well , I think 0 that 's important for your budget * to be realis- , N_S ###for it to work though , you have *-1 to do something . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah , E_S

E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###and they 're both boys E_S ###so they just MUMBLEx one year after the other in each other 's clothes , N_S ###so .

E_S 
70617:83	###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh , \[ we , \+ we \] tended *-1 to want *-2 to keep on *-3 giving lavish , gifts as , we had done before . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 .

70681:11	###so this last year he changed it , of course , E_S ###we did n't get \[ hardly and then \+ \] nearly as much back E_S ###and it was like oh , no . E_S ###* Better find another way of * saving money . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Well , uh , but I do realize that , that is realistic for some people , E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###and it was *?* for us many years , for many years . E_S 
70700:11	###SpeakerB100 . ###Yeah , E_S ###because we do n't miss it , E_S ###we really do n't , when it 's just taking *-2 out of the paycheck and stuff *T*-1 , E_S ###\[ so . \+ But \] we 're trying *-1 to put a little money away for the kids because we can \[ en- , \+ envision \] the , uh , expenses for college already , you know , eighteen years away or whatever .

70773:80	###why \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] a little concerned about *T*-2 today is that this , uh , \[ rather , uh , quick \[ and , \+ and \] easy , \+ I do n't know , I should n't say easy , rather quick \] victory \[ in the , \+ \[ in , \+ in \] the , \] uh , Mideast , uh , uh , over the , uh , Iraqis , uh , might lead us into , uh , a false sense *ICH*-1 of security that we can do that against any other foe .

E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###uh , uh , I find 0 * working in a high school is very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###Yeah . E_S 
74056:85	###SpeakerA133 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###and it keeps me from *-1 being the old fogy E_S ###so , but at the same time , it also it prevents kids from *-1 try *-2 to go *-3 pull the wool over your eyes , E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###SpeakerB136 . ###SpeakerA137 . ###Yes , E_S ###I think 0 that 's true .

74076:25	###SpeakerA141 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB142 . ###one is now a senior in high school ###and the other 's in college , E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###Well , N_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA145 . 
74091:17	###she needed *-1 to work E_S ###and he opted *-1 to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her *T*-3 . \[ And , \+ uh , and \] looked a long time before she found one that *T*-2 was laid back enough so \[ they \+ she \] would be able *-4 to interact with them , E_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh .

74108:26	###SpeakerB154 . ###\[ \[ That 's , \+ that is , \] \+ that is \] so true , E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###Yeah , ###uh , E_S ###SpeakerB156 . ###and it 's not \[ that always \+ that the children always \] say something E_S ###but every once in awhile they 'll come up and make a comment , E_S ###SpeakerA157 . ###Yeah .

74128:20	###SpeakerB162 . ###Well , I , N_S ###Linda Lee . E_S ###SpeakerA163 . ###Linda . E_S ###SpeakerB164 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA165 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB166 . 
74166:6	###SpeakerA4 . ###And I think 0 a lot of it has *-1 to do with the fact that we do n't train our teachers very well . E_S ###And then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents . E_S ###And then , oh , \[ we do n't , \+ uh , we put \] too much , uh , responsibility *ICH*-2 on the teachers , for things that *T*-1 are really not education . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###SpeakerA6 . ###SpeakerB7 . ###SpeakerA8 . ###They 're social services . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . 
74185:49	###SpeakerB13 . ###Do youself have children \[ wi- , \+ \] who *T*-1 are *RNR*-2 or have been *RNR*-2 through the public school system ? E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Yes , E_S ###I do .

74187:32	###SpeakerA14 . ###Yes , E_S ###I do . E_S ###And I was not very happy with the results . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###I see . E_S ###So if you were *-1 to improve it , what would you do *T*-2 *-3 to improve it ? E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Well , I think 0 I would start \[ with a -bout , \+ with \] *-3 getting rid *-4 of about two-thirds of the administrators . And all the auxiliary personnel . The school bureaucracy that *T*-1 exists *-2 mainly to perpetuate itself . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . 
74194:31	###SpeakerA16 . ###Well , I think 0 I would start \[ with a -bout , \+ with \] *-3 getting rid *-4 of about two-thirds of the administrators . And all the auxiliary personnel . The school bureaucracy that *T*-1 exists *-2 mainly to perpetuate itself . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###SpeakerB19 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###And then I would \[ provide , \+ uh , use \] the money that we 've paying them *T*-1 *-4 to , uh , provide some special help in training and particularly , uh , mentor teachers 0 *T*-2 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who *T*-3 may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . 
74203:148	###SpeakerB21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###SpeakerB23 . ###Sure . E_S ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###And then * let them try some innovative things and see what *T*-2 works .

And then from the parents ' side , have the parents support the school . Get involved . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
74211:36	###SpeakerB25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###SpeakerB27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###* Pay attention to what *T*-1 's happening . Talk to the teachers .

E_S ###That 's , uh , some pretty good ideas . E_S ###Why do n't you do something with those *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Well , I 've done about all 0 I can do *T*-1 which *T*-2 is * get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published *-3 and read *-3 by a lot of people . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
74224:4	###SpeakerA30 . ###Well , I 've done about all 0 I can do *T*-1 which *T*-2 is * get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published *-3 and read *-3 by a lot of people . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , you should , uh , run for a school board position . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Oh , well . That I 'm not so sure about *T*-1 . E_S ###I 've got a lot of things 0 *T*-1 to keep me busy . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
74226:42	###SpeakerB31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , you should , uh , run for a school board position . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Oh , well . That I 'm not so sure about *T*-1 . E_S ###I 've got a lot of things 0 *T*-1 to keep me busy . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###That ... N_S ###SpeakerA34 . 
74244:36	###they 've always been involved . E_S ###My parents through \[ the , \+ the \] P T A organization . E_S ###And my mother was on the school board for eight years . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###But , uh , \[ that was , \+ that 's \] the extent of which I guess 0 that 's more \[ than , \+ than \] some people , less than others . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###That 's more than a lot . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . 
74256:53	###But I believe that there 's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of * even being a teacher . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###And if there was a way 0 * \[ to , \+ \] through the public mind , set that image to be a little higher esteem , \[ a little , \+ uh , uh , a little \] more prestige to * being a teacher *T*-1 . N_S ###And with that , of course , you know , you have *-1 to pay them \[ a , \+ \] accordingly . E_S ###If we paid them more , it would attract more \[ the , \+ the \] higher educated people \[ to , \+ to \] either move into that field or to continue in that field . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . 
74271:98	###SpeakerB47 . ###SpeakerA48 . ###SpeakerB49 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###SpeakerB51 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###So we 'd have *-1 to have some way 0 * to , uh , reward and recognize the teachers who *T*-2 are doing a good job and give them \[ a , \+ a \] pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . 
74280:64	###SpeakerB53 . ###SpeakerA54 . ###SpeakerB55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###SpeakerB57 . ###\[ \[ It , \+ unfortunately , it 's a , \] \+ and it 's a \] business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S 
74293:125	###You know , if there 's some gauge that they could make *T*-1 . N_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###Uh , also , \[ I 've alw- , \+ I 've \] thought \[ around \+ \] about the idea of * making teaching and the , N_S ###before you can get a certificate , you have \[ a , \+ a \] certain residency period . \[ So \+ \] much like a doctor . E_S ###Maybe not the four years definitely . E_S ###But some certain type \[ of , \+ of \] position where you 're overseen *-1 *T*-2 * to begin with . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Yeah . E_S 
74301:37	###SpeakerA62 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Now that 's a very good suggestion . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Uh , just something 0 *T*-1 to , i- , N_S ###rather than * throw someone \[ in , \+ into \] that environment , uh , you know , it N_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ I do n't think 0 student , \+ I do n't think 0 student \] teaching is enough . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . 
74315:10	###SpeakerB67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###SpeakerB69 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###And then the student teacher did n't stay but about six weeks . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . 
74315:59	###SpeakerB67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###SpeakerB69 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###And then the student teacher did n't stay but about six weeks . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . 
74315:126	###SpeakerB67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###SpeakerB69 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###And then the student teacher did n't stay but about six weeks . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . 
74334:175	###SpeakerB77 . ###SpeakerA78 . ###SpeakerB79 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###And then also * to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance . N_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###Sure . E_S ###Sure . E_S ###That 's good as \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] teaching aid . E_S 
74334:188	###SpeakerB77 . ###SpeakerA78 . ###SpeakerB79 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###And then also * to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance . N_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###Sure . E_S ###Sure . E_S ###That 's good as \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] teaching aid . E_S 
74346:31	###SpeakerA82 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###And , you know , the whole electronic classroom idea . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###SpeakerB85 . ###I do n't know if I I 'm \[ in favor \+ yeah , in favor \] of , yeah , N_S ###SpeakerA86 . ###I do n't think 0 that 's going *-1 to work . E_S ###SpeakerB87 . 
74357:139	###SpeakerA88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , another thing 0 I think 0 *T*-1 would be helpful would be * to have some sort \[ of , \+ of \] say a national curriculum . Because one of the problems with * getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for , uh , curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that *T*-2 will sell in Texas and California . E_S ###And then everybody else is stuck *-1 with that , regardless of what they want *-2 to teach *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###Huh . E_S ###Is that because that 's where the two biggest markets are *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA90 . ###Because it ... N_S ###SpeakerB91 . 
74361:40	###SpeakerB89 . ###Huh . E_S ###Is that because that 's where the two biggest markets are *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA90 . ###Because it ... N_S ###SpeakerB91 . ###or ? N_S ###SpeakerA92 . ###Well , that 's the two states that *T*-1 adopt on a state wide basis . E_S ###SpeakerB93 . 
74364:20	###SpeakerA90 . ###Because it ... N_S ###SpeakerB91 . ###or ? N_S ###SpeakerA92 . ###Well , that 's the two states that *T*-1 adopt on a state wide basis . E_S ###SpeakerB93 . ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerA94 . ###Uh , and so it , uh , N_S 
74389:92	###SpeakerB101 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###MUMBLEx California is the biggest for elementary schools E_S ###but Texas , uh , adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade . E_S ###SpeakerB103 . ###I see . E_S ###Well , * definitely is a national problem \[ if , \+ \] that they need *-1 to address *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###Yep . E_S 
74464:6	###I mean \[ wha- , \+ what \] part of town . \[ In \+ here in \] Denison . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Okay , E_S ###we- , N_S ###see , that 's north . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Or down here in Denison , N_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Okay , E_S 
74506:70	###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Anyway , my home \[ is , \+ um , I guess 0 it 's \] about twenty-five hundred square foot E_S ###and I have , uh , four bedrooms at the present . E_S ###We 're busting out walls and things like that . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###That 's what I want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S ###How many kids do you have *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB32 .

74531:19	###We just had a baby a couple months ago E_S ###and we 've got a den , E_S ###it 's more or less a spare room . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###We rarely go in there , except for *-1 to play chess . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
74550:5	###SpeakerB44 . ###Right , E_S ###there 's they , uh , N_S ###I know what you 're saying *T*-1 there , E_S ###ours is the same E_S ###and they tend *-1 to put windows in the strangest places .

74566:38	###so . N_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###No privacy . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###No , E_S ###we do n't have a lot of that , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Well , we 've got at least two windows on every wall in the house . E_S ###It , N_S 
74603:5	###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###and he did it hisself , E_S ###so most of that , by now , is falling apart . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###You know , well I mean , it 's not just horrible , E_S ###but like this tile 's come loose off the wall , E_S

74716:16	###he really should have hired people . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Well that 's something , N_S ###my husband 's in construction E_S ###and he wo n't even touch electrical stuff .

75287:10	###I mean I can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have *-1 to worry about it .

E_S ###Do you live in a real small town \[ or , \+ or \] out in the country ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###I live out in the country , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
75298:5	###SpeakerB12 . ###I 'm about fifteen miles out . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###About fifteen miles .

75343:37	###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh , I would say 0 the majority of it 's happening during the day , uh , between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh .

75352:4	###SpeakerA37 . ###Well , \[ most families , \+ most families \] are young E_S ###and both people are working . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh .

75387:9	###SpeakerA53 . ###Well , uh , the police force , for one , E_S ###I think 0 they could , uh , definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use *T*-1 . E_S ###Uh , it 's , E_S ###oh , right now I think 0 *T*-1 , we are about thirty thousand people E_S ###and there 's only eight officers that *T*-1 patrol \[ for thirty , \+ for that amount \] of people which *T*-2 is not very many . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . 
75393:66	###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###And , N_S 
75408:15	###SpeakerA61 . ###Well , the , N_S ###course in our particular state , uh , we have the prison overcrowding , whatever , E_S ###so they 're giving the early release , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Right .

75419:15	###but for the , N_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###So you think 0 that would be a deterrent ? E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###That would \[ be , \+ certainly be \] a deterrent . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And , uh , not necessarily , you know , give in to their , uh , human rights desires .

75432:24	###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh , I think 0 they 'd have *-1 to go to extra measures *-2 to make * sure 0 a person 's guilty , you know , in a lot of cases .

75526:40	###SpeakerB110 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###SpeakerB112 . ###Uh-huh .

75556:16	###SpeakerB124 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 \[ in our , \+ in our \] particular neighborhood , vigilantism is becoming a \[ real , \+ real \] possibility . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###Uh , we 've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually , you know , shot the people *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB128 . 
75565:37	###SpeakerB128 . ###Oh , my God . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###and , uh , return offenders have , N_S ###they 've actually waited for them , where they 've robbed , you know , particular neighborhood *T*-1 , E_S ###they 'll rob one house , E_S ###then other people will wait up , you know , and wait for somebody to do something else , try *-1 to take it in their own hands . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . 
75570:25	###they 'll rob one house , E_S ###then other people will wait up , you know , and wait for somebody to do something else , try *-1 to take it in their own hands . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###Course it does n't always work out in their favor . E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###Right .

75603:22	###SpeakerB144 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###And , uh , it helps for a while E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA147 . ###but then just another different set of people come in , E_S ###and most of the people are transients from \[ out , \+ outside \] of the state . E_S ###SpeakerB148 . 
75620:23	###SpeakerB152 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA153 . ###it 's not many from the local communities . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###But , uh , it 's a problem , E_S ###and \[ \[ I , \+ I just , \] \+ I think \] that the court systems need *-1 to be more \[ accurate \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ stiffer in \] their penalties , E_S ###SpeakerB156 . 
75634:73	###SpeakerB158 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA159 . ###SpeakerB160 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-1 to agree with you .

E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###\[ You , \+ You \] are experienced I would say 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
75684:18	###SpeakerA11 . ###Well , I agree . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###I have done something , uh , like that , too , only not nearly as extensive . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###But it *EXP*-4 must be interesting now * trying *-1 to do something to a basic ranch , style home . Uh , after *-2 having a one that *T*-3 was historical looking . E_S 
75706:5	###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , the town that I was living in *T*-1 only about eighty miles from here . E_S ###So , uh , you know , \[ I , \+ we , \] N_S ###really it was just N_S ###the market was so good , E_S ###we had n't really planned on *-1 buying E_S ###and , as you probably heard \[ from the , \+ in the \] Dallas and Texas area period the housing market is just unreal . E_S ###I mean you can get things for such a song . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
75717:37	###This is not \[ what we , \+ you know , what we \] want *-1 to stay in *T*-2 forever , because \[ I have *-3 to have my , \+ I 've found that after *-4 doing this other house , I have *-5 to have my \] hands into stuff E_S ###and , you know , I 'm always just wanting *-1 to paint \[ and , \+ and \] wallpaper and redo and redo , E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###so , uh , you know , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] ready *-1 to get ahold of another one that I can have a little more input into *T*-2 E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Well , maybe you can , uh , make that one charming \[ and , \+ and \] make a little bit money , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB28 . 
75718:40	###and , you know , I 'm always just wanting *-1 to paint \[ and , \+ and \] wallpaper and redo and redo , E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S 
75730:24	###new carpet and everything E_S ###so I feel sort of , uh , you know , like it *EXP*-5 's sort of defeating my purpose *-1 to go *-2 rip everything out now and do it over just because I 'm in the mood 0 *-3 to do it *T*-4 . E_S ###So , uh , \[ we 'll see , \+ we 'll see \] how much longer we 're here *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Well , we just moved to Charlotte , from Enid , Oklahoma . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
75733:46	###SpeakerA29 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Well , we just moved to Charlotte , from Enid , Oklahoma . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###Oh , Oklahoma of all places . E_S 
75745:18	###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###and I 'll tell you , uh , 0 \[ we , \+ we \] had kind of a charming house . E_S 
75785:7	###we kind of had planned this , uh , trek to the east , because we 're both originally from this part of the country . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###I see , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###And so , I think 0 some of the things that I did *T*-1 paid off . E_S 
75808:68	###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###and uh , all the men started *-1 going down to the barn . E_S 
75828:11	###SpeakerA77 . ###Yes , E_S ###I 'm going to the barn , too . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Exactly . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###They , uh , auctioned some tools and , things like that , E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . 
75872:9	###SpeakerB100 . ###For forty dollars ? E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###For forty dollars . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Oh , my . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###And so what we did *T*-1 , N_S ###we had built a deck on the back of that house , E_S ###SpeakerB104 . 
75906:36	###SpeakerB116 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###but I figured the sand and all , had that delivered *-1 and , leveled it \[ and , \+ and , \] placed most all the bricks . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###SpeakerB120 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . 
75937:4	###I know 0 my parents bought a house about ten years ago , E_S ###they 're fixing *-1 to sell it again , \[ but , \+ and \] move again . E_S ###They 're kind of , N_S ###my mom 's like I am *?* . E_S ###She 's a renovator , a lover of old things E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###Uh-huh .

76029:23	###She may just , N_S ###hopefully they 'll sell the house , and go somewhere else . E_S ###SpeakerA167 . ###SpeakerB168 . ###SpeakerA169 . ###Well , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 she needs *-1 to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB170 . ###And then she wo n't have *-1 to worry about it .

76045:6	###SpeakerB174 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA175 . ###Dursban or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB176 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ what it , \+ what it \] is *T*-2 \[ that *T*-1 'll , \+ that *T*-3 'll , \] take care of them . E_S ###SpeakerA177 . ###Dursban , E_S ###SpeakerB178 .

76080:33	###SpeakerA189 . ###Yeah .

76222:13	###That 's really scary . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S

80399:38	###SpeakerA37 . ###Well , uh , we used a latex , uh , wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork E_S ###and my job was mostly the woodwork . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Okay , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###My husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers E_S ###and I got *-1 to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine , uh , trim work , where I 'd use a small brush and , uh , try *-2 to keep the paint from * dripping on the windows and things like that *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . 
80408:71	###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well \[ we only have on- , \+ only one \] of our bathroom has a window in it E_S ###so I 'm hoping that , um , it wo n't be too much of \[ a , \+ a \] problem . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
80426:55	###SpeakerB48 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Um , I tried *-1 to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago , oh , with a just a scraper and wet sponge E_S ###and it took forever . E_S ###I would not recommend that method . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh , \[ if \+ if you can rent a steamer , \] if it 's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble . E_S 
80440:33	###SpeakerB54 . ###\[ It , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] hard * to tell , E_S ###it 's , N_S ###the patterns look like they 're nineteen sixties style . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###And I know 0 the house , um , was built *-1 around the mid fifties . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
80490:38	###and if you discover 0 you like it then you can always upscale . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###It would n't be any kind of \[ special , \+ um , special \] effects type thing . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Yeah . E_S 
80505:155	###and it can be done *-1 a whole lot faster . ###And with rollers and , uh , modern latex paints , E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Um , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###you can wash up easily because they 're water soluble . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###And they dry fast E_S 
80520:69	###SpeakerB84 . ###\[ It , \+ it \] peels the paint off when you take it off *T*-1 , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Well , not , N_S ###\[ i- , \+ if \] you leave it on for weeks , it will do that . E_S ###If you take it up the next day it should be fine . E_S ###You want it to get dry , but not , uh , just real hard . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah , E_S 
80520:91	###SpeakerB84 . ###\[ It , \+ it \] peels the paint off when you take it off *T*-1 , E_S ###yeah .

80541:23	###SpeakerB90 . ###Oh really , E_S ###okay . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###and then you end up *-1 tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###And the whole point of * using it is * to save yourself work . E_S ###You can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape . E_S 
80552:60	###SpeakerB94 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###SpeakerB96 . ###Well I really appreciate all the helpful tips , E_S ###I think 0 you \[ are , \+ \] just made my project a lot easier .

E_S ###The last time 0 I had something done * *T*-1 was my kitchen cabinets E_S 
80573:19	###I may just be flat painting over it . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Well , of course that 's the other advantage of paint . E_S ###If you do n't like it all 0 you do *T*-1 is * put on another coat . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###I guess 0 we 'd better go because our time looks like it 's about up . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Yeah , E_S

80628:50	###We seem *-1 to start dinner around six and finish it up . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###I find that I 'm leaning on , uh , N_S ###I travel a great deal , uh , even overseas , E_S ###and I find that I lean on , uh , C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff .

80642:28	###SpeakerA16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###SpeakerA18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###And they seemed *-1 to have the best coverage . E_S ###They had more information sooner than , most of the other networks . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###Uh . E_S 
80662:57	###SpeakerB25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###and if you did n't like it , that was just too bad , you know .

81324:18	###SpeakerA161 . ###THE NEVER ENDING STORY ? E_S ###SpeakerB162 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA163 . ###It 's a child 's movie , E_S ###but , oh , it 's good , E_S ###I enjoyed it . E_S ###SpeakerB164 . ###I love Disney movies . E_S 
81430:4	###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay , E_S ###I live in Plano , in a four bedroom , two bath house , which *T*-1 is ###the area 's dominantly three bedroom , two bath . E_S ###So , I 'm just a little bit different than typical , uh , E_S ###and of course , the Plano area is basically with alleyways , E_S ###so everything around here is set *-1 up that way . Which I think 0 *T*-4 is a little bit different than most areas , in the houses , the way 0 they 're constructed *-3 *T*-2 . E_S ###And it 's a brick house , with , uh , some wood . E_S ###It 's real nice , E_S ###I like it . E_S 
81433:40	###the area 's dominantly three bedroom , two bath . E_S ###So , I 'm just a little bit different than typical , uh , E_S ###and of course , the Plano area is basically with alleyways , E_S ###so everything around here is set *-1 up that way . Which I think 0 *T*-4 is a little bit different than most areas , in the houses , the way 0 they 're constructed *-3 *T*-2 . E_S ###And it 's a brick house , with , uh , some wood . E_S ###It 's real nice , E_S ###I like it . E_S ###How about you ? E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Well \[ I , \+ I \] certainly hope so . E_S 
81437:37	###And it 's a brick house , with , uh , some wood . E_S ###It 's real nice , E_S ###I like it . E_S ###How about you ? E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Well \[ I , \+ I \] certainly hope so . E_S ###We have \[ a , \+ a \] classic ranch , up in Denton . E_S ###Ranch style home , ###\[ I shou- , \+ I would \] hate *-1 to think that anybody thought , uh , 0 the lot 0 we live on *T*-2 as a ranch . E_S ###Uh , it 's in a subdivision and one story . E_S 
81459:11	###they 'll say , oh this could be five bedrooms . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###if you had two people that *T*-1 do n't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house , E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###Yeah , E_S ###to . N_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###* do n't need a closet . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###The only thing about mine , um , I think 0 there 's probably about , oh , 
81470:5	###and usually they are the four bedroom , um , E_S ###but they 're spaced *-1 out , oh I 'd say *ICH*-2 maybe three , on a two block period . E_S ###Because it 's all different builders up here . E_S ###So it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard at that point * to , you know , classify some of the builders . E_S ###But most of the builders all built three , two . E_S ###But the one thing , my house is a little bit different E_S ###and I can pick it out again because it 's not typical , E_S ###\[ is \+ \] I 've got the , oh , ###what do you call a , uh , double ceiling , double high in one half of the house *T*-1 . E_S ###So like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings . E_S 
81479:4	###So like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Uh , cathedral ceilings . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###And , uh , the kitchen is norm E_S ###and the bedrooms are norm . E_S ###So it just goes down the dining room , the family room , and the living room that way . E_S ###And I love the space . E_S ###\[ It just , \+ it 's , \] uh , N_S ###luckily I came from a house in Colorado which *T*-1 had the cathedral ceiling E_S 
81489:29	###and I just lucked out and walked into this one E_S ###and of course I felt the same airy feeling , which I liked *T*-1 it real well , E_S ###so it *EXP*-1 's a nice thing * to move into , E_S ###but , again , it 's not typical in this area . E_S ###You can just spot them because \[ the ce- , \+ the roof \] is so \[ hi- , \+ much higher . \] E_S ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Well I had n't thought about it in that sense , of the high roofs . E_S ###We have cathedral ceilings in , uh , two rooms . In the , uh , family room and in the master bedroom E_S ###and those \[ are , \+ are \] pleasant . E_S 
81491:31	###so it *EXP*-1 's a nice thing * to move into , E_S ###but , again , it 's not typical in this area . E_S ###You can just spot them because \[ the ce- , \+ the roof \] is so \[ hi- , \+ much higher . \] E_S ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Well I had n't thought about it in that sense , of the high roofs .

81517:11	###but until that time . E_S ###But , uh , I 've noticed 0 the houses around here \[ are basically , \+ it 's one story and they 're all basically \] two , uh , bath , \[ two , \+ \] uh , with three bedrooms . E_S ###And we 're N_S ###\[ \[ ninety , \+ I would say 0 \[ about , \+ oh , about \] ninety-five \] percent , \+ no I guess 0 \[ may- , \+ probably \] a hundred percent \] of them all are mostly brick , uh , with some wood . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###But \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] basically all brick . E_S ###The next subdivision over from me is total brick E_S ###and the one on the other side of me is about the same as mine . E_S 
81531:46	###SpeakerB21 . ###If it 's the kind of river 0 I 'm thinking of *T*-1 , better \[ them , \+ \[ than , \+ than \] \] us , you know .

E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh .

83126:37	###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . ###but in Florida now , uh , uh , uh , \[ at eighteen years , \+ someone was just sentenced *-1 to eighteen years , \] I heard it on TODAY , uh , without any specific recommendation for , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , * waving the normal , uh , procedures .

83164:18	###\[ Do you , \+ do you \] think 0 that should be changed *-1 ?

83199:26	###\[ It , \+ it \] is faced *-1 with , uh , uh , enormous costs * to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system .

84878:9	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] major cause it seems 0 *T*-1 up here is exc- , N_S ###I live right on the ocean E_S ###so it *EXP*-2 's kind of hard for me to tell what *T*-1 would happen if I lived in some of the valleys inland , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###but the major cause here , and we always seem *-3 to , and it seems *-1 to be validated *-2 by the press , is the car pollution .

84932:58	###\[ and , \+ and , \] we certainly turned into an air conditioned society . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Society , has especially recently . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S 
84947:19	###SpeakerB26 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###it 's quite , N_S ###\[ is , \+ is \] the un- , N_S ###it *EXP*-1 's really out of the norm * not to find something that *T*-2 is n't air conditioned . E_S ###And , N_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S 
84994:58	###SpeakerA43 . ###Converter , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###And no lead gas \[ was , \+ came \] to the pumps . E_S ###\[ And , \+ and \] that 's been done *-1 .

85117:124	###SpeakerB92 . ###Well , \[ since , \+ since \] Texas and Louisiana and , uh , California \[ that , \+ in that \] ranking order , the worst pollutants in America .

85220:25	###and the carpet was new E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###Huh . E_S ###Do you live in the high-rise ? E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###No , E_S ###it 's not a high-rise . E_S ###It 's just \[ a , \+ a \] two story building . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . 
85237:22	###SpeakerB19 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###\[ So , \+ so \] \[ you just , \+ you \] have one floor all to yourself ? E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###The rooms are nice and large E_S ###and , * let 's see , 
85283:44	###SpeakerA36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###\[ It just , \+ It 's \] a real good , N_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###It just never happened before . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###SpeakerB39 . ###So it 's really surprising everybody . E_S ###All the developers do n't know what * to do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . 
85292:20	###SpeakerA40 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's a good time 0 * to buy *T*-1 , if you 're in the market . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###SpeakerB43 . ###unfortunate- , N_S ###\[ we 're , \+ uh , we actually have \] our house on the market because we have two kids E_S ###SpeakerA44 . 
85326:12	###and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###And , uh , they had a basement , E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###SpeakerA58 . ###and \[ they , \+ you know , they \] finished the basement , E_S ###and they were able *-1 to rent that out also .

85345:14	###SpeakerA62 . ###No , E_S ###it 's a- , N_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###They put pools and garages *ICH*-1 on , but , uh , no basements . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###SpeakerA66 . ###\[ \[ I have n't , \+ I have n't , \] \+ I have \] yet *-1 to see a basement in a house . E_S 
85372:42	###SpeakerB71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . ###or the foundation is sinking or something . You know , \[ just a little , \+ just a little \] bit , some more than others .

E_S ###SpeakerA76 . 
85377:80	###SpeakerB73 . ###SpeakerA74 . ###SpeakerB75 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###And , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###Well , out here \[ we , \+ um , we \] live in what *T*-1 used *-2 to be , uh , like a prairie or whatever a \[ natural , \+ you know , natural \] grasslands . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
85385:45	###SpeakerA78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###And , uh , they , N_S ###it 's just , 0 you go down four inches E_S ###and \[ you get to sands- , \+ well , fourteen inches you get to sandstone . \] E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###And so any place where they put a basement in *T*-1 they had *-2 to blast . E_S 
85395:16	###SpeakerA82 . ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###It 's just solid sandstone . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###Huh . E_S ###Where did you say 0 you 're at , *T*-1 Colorado ? E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###No , E_S ###Virginia . E_S 
85402:4	###SpeakerB85 . ###No , E_S ###Virginia . E_S ###SpeakerA86 . ###Virginia , E_S ###Virginia . E_S ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's sort of unusual really . E_S 
85452:11	###This is called *-1 \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] country , you know , with only , you know , maybe twenty miles total from D C , twenty-five from the city . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB103 . ###But , um , it 's considered *-1 the country since it 's , uh , you know , that far out . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###Well MUMBLEx , N_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###But , um , yeah , E_S ###we live out by Dulles Airport . E_S 
85497:25	###SpeakerA118 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB119 . ###Uh , my folks , um , had an apartment for a while when we were kids *T*-1 E_S ###but , um , for the most part \[ i- , \+ \[ they , \+ they \] \] always had , you know , N_S ###and Pennsylvania always had a single family home E_S ###and so , you know , as soon as we could \[ we , \+ we \] got a single family home , E_S ###SpeakerA120 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB121 . 
85501:38	###but , um , for the most part \[ i- , \+ \[ they , \+ they \] \] always had , you know , N_S ###and Pennsylvania always had a single family home E_S ###and so , you know , as soon as we could \[ we , \+ we \] got a single family home , E_S ###SpeakerA120 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB121 . ###and that 's all 0 I ever knew *T*-1 * growing up , E_S ###SpeakerA122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB123 . 
85570:16	###\[ And , \+ and \] right now , \[ I , \+ I \] think that that 's been proven *-1 in the fact that , um , they have just , N_S ###well , anyway , I just think that , you know , the United States policy over there , N_S ###I think 0 we should just leave them alone . E_S ###I really do . \[ In , \+ in \] a major way because \[ they just , \+ um , that whole region over there , \] I think 0 *T*-2 needs *-1 to settle its own differences within itself . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And that 's \[ the way , \+ the course \] that they should go *T*-1 , E_S ###I mean , you know , we can maybe help them a little bit , prompt them , E_S ###but I do n't think 0 this intervention at such high levels should be going on . E_S 
85613:60	###SpeakerA33 . ###Well , ye- , E_S ###well , yeah , E_S ###um , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 we could be a catalyst for their change . E_S ###I , um , N_S ###the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there E_S ###and I do n't think 0 we 'd be talking about this , you know , the \[ Israeli situation , \+ Palestinian situation , \] um , sort of came to a head , um , unless there had been a war . E_S ###I mean that was one thing *ICH*-2 , that *T*-1 came out of it , good or bad , E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah . E_S 
85613:82	###SpeakerA33 . ###Well , ye- , E_S ###well , yeah , E_S ###um , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 we could be a catalyst for their change .

85659:38	###SpeakerA49 . ###Oh , well yeah , E_S ###\[ they , \+ they \] understand violence . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###There was nothing else . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###They love violent leaders , to , you know , E_S ###I mean * look at , you know , the leader 0 they had *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ They , \+ they \] just adored him , because he was so strict and cruel , E_S 
85675:19	###SpeakerA55 . ###Well it has a lot 0 * to do *T*-1 with their religion . E_S ###I got *-1 to say , that over there , um , N_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yes , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###and I know this only because from personal experience that I 'm speaking of this , E_S ###because \[ I , \+ I 've , \] you know , traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I 've done that *T*-1 E_S ###and \[ one , \+ one \] of the kindest people 0 I 've ever met *T*-1 in my whole life , um , is from that area of the country E_S 
85684:69	###and \[ one , \+ one \] of the kindest people 0 I 've ever met *T*-1 in my whole life , um , is from that area of the country E_S ###and I mean \[ he is just overly , \+ \[ he , \+ he \] is abounding \] in kindness , * let 's say 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###And his wife is so godly ###, I mean , every thought , E_S ###they have a totally different life than we have *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Huh . E_S 
85696:17	###SpeakerB62 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###And they have very basic life , um , E_S ###well it 's just a very basic life E_S ###and they just really believe in Allah , or God , or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###And \[ it 's , \+ you know , everything is \] to the glory of Allah , E_S 
85709:5	###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well that 's , see using that , E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###yes , E_S ###and they abuse that . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . 
85724:4	###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###So it 's really hard , when you see the leaders , compared to the people *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###But \[ I think 0 \[ in a , \+ in a \] way the war , \+ uh , I think 0 in a way all , the involvement \] over there too , though , has shown \[ a lot of people \+ that there are a lot of people \] that *T*-1 do n't follow what those few are doing *T*-2 .

85752:16	###Um , you know , E_S there are political boundaries E_S ###and those are man made boundaries , E_S ###but , you know , for heaven sakes , that 's something that *T*-1 's been *-2 going on for ages , E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 so much of it is what you 're taught *T*-1 .

85788:66	###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right . E_S ###Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] was listening , uh , on the radio the other day E_S ###and they were talking that , \[ \[ s- , \+ s- , \] \+ something \] like this , N_S ###I think 0 they were talking about the fact that , um , the money that *T*-1 could be saved *-2 , um , in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by * consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider , um , \[ could , \+ uh , could , \] N_S 
85799:80	###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh , we 're currently , where I 'm working now , under Blue Cross *T*-1 .

85802:21	###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###I do n't know what the total cost of the program is *T*-1 E_S ###but for dependent coverage I 'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars \[ a , \+ a \] month or something like that .

85823:18	###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah , E_S ###H M O . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] fairly expensive .

E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###And , uh , the reason 0 \[ I , \+ I \] quite *T*-1 was \[ because of , \+ uh , not because \] I did n't like it , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] really kind of did .

E_S 
85856:87	###but , you know , if you do n't have a doctor anyway normally it does n't really make much difference .

E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###and then , we did find several good doctors . E_S ###And , um , like you say it 's , uh , five dollars an office visit . E_S ###And , um , my wife was in the hospital \[ had our , \+ had our \] daughter E_S ###and I think 0 her total bill was around three hundred dollars for everything . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
85925:56	###SpeakerB70 . ###Right .

85930:20	###SpeakerB72 . ###Right .

85937:98	###SpeakerA77 . ###Right .

87259:76	###SpeakerA103 . ###Oh , I think so . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Um , in spite of , uh , N_S ###or \[ if you , \+ if you \] do buy it , it 's extremely expensive .

87279:41	###I decided 0 \[ I , \+ I \] just could n't quite make myself , um , buy it because I do make cheesecake E_S ###and somehow I did n't want *-1 to do that because it , N_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###There you go *T*-1 .

87359:7	###SpeakerB142 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###SpeakerB144 . ###SpeakerA145 . ###SpeakerB146 . ###SpeakerA147 . ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###I 'll bet . E_S 
87388:69	###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And \[ her , \+ her \] time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###I see .

87415:120	###Now , I think 0 I 'm leaving out a portion .

E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###now \[ I 'm , \+ uh , uh , oh , I , \] N_S ###\[ we 'd , \+ when we \] moved to \[ R- , \+ Richardson *T*-2 , \] one of the reasons 0 we chose it *T*-1 was \[ for the , \+ uh , for the \] schools . ###\[ And , \+ and \] * realizing that \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing \[ to , \+ uh , *-1 to \] go for that , because we supported the , N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah .

87634:21	###\[ And , \+ and \] * realizing that \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing \[ to , \+ uh , *-1 to \] go for that , because we supported the , N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Then again \[ the , \+ the \] community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent , E_S ###and the public , colleges also , the tuition has got *-1 to be among the lowest in the country . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
87650:40	###Well if you double the tuition , it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 that 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That would provide , uh , possibly some relief there * to utilize some of the property taxes for other things *T*-2 , see . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
87687:94	###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] even if it is , is n't going *-1 to , uh , uh , provide you with \[ any , \+ any \] services in that it 's not doing *-2 to provide a route from \[ your , \+ your \] home to a business , for instance , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Well , \[ this , \+ this \] is a thing E_S ###I think 0 it 's like , uh , back east . E_S ###You had *-1 to start your public transportation when you started your cities *T*-2 . E_S ###You ca n't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it . E_S ###If we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that , and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and , uh , construction costs were cheap *T*-1 , you could afford it .

87709:38	###SpeakerA47 . ###Absolutely . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Whereas \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ uh , in \] Dallas here \[ \[ we 've , \+ we 've got , \] \+ \] uh , those patterns were well established \[ before , \+ before \] we really \[ tried * to , \+ tried *-1 to \] do the DART .

87722:24	###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###New York N_S ###and some , people do n't even own a car and know how * to drive a car *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###Right , E_S 
87727:36	###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Someone made the analogy , uh , with Texans as *-1 being like the old cowboys and their horse . E_S ###An old cowboy would jump on his horse *-1 to go across the street .

87758:51	###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###we saw about them traveling to San Francisco *-1 to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###I felt 0 that was a little , uh , wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying *T*-1 , you know . E_S 
87792:6	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , \[ I saw , um , \+ lately I 've seen \] SOAP DISH . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Which *T*-1 was a , N_S ###and that was a lot of fun .

90924:61	###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###I think , uh , 0 I would agree with that .

90949:25	###SpeakerA71 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###SpeakerA75 . ###does it have a big ten football team E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB76 . 
90979:30	###But \[ I , \+ I \] think , you know , 0 I 'm actually at a smaller program , E_S ###I 'm not at \[ the col- , \+ the big College Park campus , \] you know , E_S ###that 's the big one with the football team . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###So \[ \[ I , \+ I think , \] \+ um , I think \] 0 you 're right , that \[ there 's a lot of , \+ there 's difficult decisions \] *ICH*-1 there based * on name recognition . E_S ###Um , you know , when I first was applying for graduate schools *T*-1 , I applied to some big programs *ICH*-2 , you know , in this area , like Stevens Institute of Technology , which *T*-3 is recognized *-4 in the Northeast \[ as , \+ as , \] you know , one step below M I T in a sense , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S 
90987:20	###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###so it 's got big name recognition in this area , ###a big science school , no football team , but a big science school , E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###and technical people know that . E_S ###But I don- , N_S 
90987:110	###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###so it 's got big name recognition in this area , ###a big science school , no football team , but a big science school , E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###and technical people know that . E_S ###But I don- , N_S 
91001:27	###and when I , N_S ###now , I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs *T*-1 , E_S ###I was going *-1 to be a teacher , E_S ###I was just a high school teacher , E_S ###so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of , E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###you know , but then when I went , um , for graduate work , you know , or for a new job *T*-1 , people said to me , you know , Shippensburg State , ###where is that *T*-1 , you know . E_S 
91003:28	###I was going *-1 to be a teacher , E_S ###I was just a high school teacher , E_S ###so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of , E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah .

91010:20	###where is that *T*-1 , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###So I think yeah , E_S 
91011:4	###SpeakerB90 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###And , you know , when I went into higher education *T*-1 , even at other universities , they were n't aware of it , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###So I think yeah , E_S ###that 's important , E_S 
91016:19	###SpeakerB92 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###So I think yeah , E_S ###that 's important , E_S ###um , . I think 0 it depends on \[ if you want *-1 to be a , \+ if you want a \] regional job or a national job , E_S ###you need that first , job or so out of school , too . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . 
91030:18	###Oh , \[ go- , \+ in * going \] to school , you get taught *-1 the things 0 you learn *T*-2 in school , E_S ###but there is also a whole other dimension , I mean the growing up while you 're going *-1 to school *T*-2 part . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###And , uh , actually , in the Midwest especially , a lot of the schools \[ have , \+ like University of Missouri , will have \] a main campus like Columbia , which *T*-1 is big , multi disciplinary , E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Right .

91037:99	###SpeakerA99 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###and they 'll have a satellite campus *ICH*-1 \[ in a , \+ usually in a \] smaller town that *T*-2 specializes in the technical field .

93309:4	###SpeakerB107 . ###Uh , we 've only gone on the seven day cruises . E_S ###SpeakerA108 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB109 . ###They have shorter ones E_S ###and then they have ten day ones .

93324:15	###and that was pushing it a bit . E_S ###SpeakerA112 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh , I tend , ###\[ when , \+ when \] I spend enough money * to go overseas *T*-1 , N_S I , go for a long time .

93449:34	###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh .

93935:4	###\[ wh- , \+ where \] do they get it *T*-1 ? .

93946:104	###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###so I just , N_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###It \[ helps if you , \+ \[ I \+ \] helps if you \] leave the pit in it . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Oh , does that help ? E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah , E_S 
94048:16	###Uh , you mix , um , cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of , uh , like Cool Whip E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Right , E_S ###right E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###that 's good and quick and easy , E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###that 's always good , E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###SpeakerA113 . 
94077:4	###SpeakerA7 . ###Down at Lake Texoma lodge . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yes , E_S ###this is one that *T*-1 's , uh , the Baker family reunion E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
94111:48	###SpeakerA23 . ###Very important , because , uh , you 'll start *-1 losing people if it 's too far * to go . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###We have factions , when it 's one part *T*-1 , E_S ###\[ we , \+ I \] have one reunion on my mother 's side , E_S ###and we found that if it 's in a certain part of Texas , some people come , E_S ###and if it 's elsewhere , other people come E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S 
94116:16	###\[ we , \+ I \] have one reunion on my mother 's side , E_S ###and we found that if it 's in a certain part of Texas , some people come , E_S ###and if it 's elsewhere , other people come E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah .

94158:5	###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh , generally , uh , I think 0 *T*-1 it 's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###I think 0 normal 's about sixty or seventy . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , I guess , um , 0 ours probably is n't that big . E_S ###Our family is dwindling , for one thing . E_S 
94177:10	###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###and we 're kind of off on the sidelines . E_S ###But it does remind us that we have family and roots . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###So we keep *-1 going even though we 're not a real big part of it . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . 
94236:35	###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia , E_S ###and I think 0 we 've been to one in thirty-five years or something like that , E_S ###so , That 's just too far away . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah , E_S 
94260:23	###SpeakerA81 . ###SpeakerB82 . ###They 're going *-1 to have it at Fort Davis E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###and we thought 0 that would be fun * to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . 
94279:12	###And it takes a lot of planning , and assembling of stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###SpeakerB92 . ###And * choose , some place that everybody 's going *-1 to like *T*-2 as far as food and all that . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###SpeakerB94 . ###SpeakerA95 . ###Right . E_S 
94399:4	###SpeakerB2 . ###The biggest problem , well , like in this part of town seems *-1 to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that , uh , you know , you can throw money at it , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###but it 's , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know , because , I mean , the general values that we 're teaching *T*-1 kind of conflict with what we expect *T*-2 out of people in school , I mean , E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
94407:107	###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###\[ Is it the , \+ do you think 0 it 's the \] values that they 're teaching *T*-1 in school or the values 0 they get *T*-2 from home . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh , well , the values , more or less at home and the T V , just a general , N_S 
94435:93	###and , uh uh , I think that that part of that showing up now , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] things because kids I think have probably less respect \[ than \+ \] \[ for , \+ for \] people \[ than \+ \] \[ in , \+ in \] other things , than we may have seen in the past , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and part of it 's \[ the , \+ the \] family , I think 0 *T*-1 , E_S ###and part of it 's , uh , the living conditions \[ of \+ \] 0 certain people are subjected *-1 too *T*-2 , E_S ###drugs is a big problem now , E_S ###and I think 0 \[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's , \] \+ that 's \] another root problem . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S 
94453:66	###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###I thought , well , you know , of course they 're doing better , ###and not so much when I was growing up *T*-1 , E_S Catholic schools are generally considered *-1 a little bit easier than the public schools , E_S ###but , uh , they still had \[ a , \+ a \] better success rate , simply because they started with a lot better raw material . E_S ###I mean everybody that *T*-1 went to a Catholic school \[ had , \+ uh , at least the parents did , at least , had \] education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Right , E_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
94458:15	###but , uh , they still had \[ a , \+ a \] better success rate , simply because they started with a lot better raw material .

E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Right , E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###And I wonder if , not so much that , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA23 . 
94471:26	###\[ and , \+ and \] they 're not all that way , E_S ###but , you know , some that *T*-1 are *?* um , \[ \[ that , \+ they 're , \] \+ they 're \] not quite the same as the kids that *T*-2 are going to the inner city , uh , you know , public schools . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah , E_S ###this is interesting because in my mind I do n't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment , E_S ###but , uh , \[ this , \+ this \] was actually inner city E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
94486:44	###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , you know , in a lot of cases like that , where , you know , if kids are going to a public parochial school like that , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education . ###\[ It shows , \+ I think 0 it shows \] that the parents have some , uh , desire \[ for , \+ for \] the kid to \[ do , \+ do \] well , you know , E_S ###and that may be passed *-1 on down to the kid as well , E_S ###and , uh , maybe they pick up on that . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###And then from the other aspect , um , maybe the , uh , school itself \[ \[ has , \+ has , \] \+ has \] more emphasis on , uh , *-1 trying *-2 to do a good job because the classes may be smaller , uh , E_S 
94501:25	###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh , that 's a tough question how * to fix the school system *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh , with , uh , N_S ###I would try *-1 \[ to , \+ I guess , to \] see about * getting parents more involved , \[ with , \+ \] try \[ * to , \+ *-1 to \] come up with more ways 0 * to do that *T*-2 . Uh , uh , uh , stress the importance of education to \[ both \+ both \] the parents and the students , and , uh , \[ more , \+ more \] classes \[ that \+ I think that \] *T*-3 are , N_S ###and I think 0 this is happening some around the country in terms of , um , morals , * trying *-1 to teach the kinds of things \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 are n't getting taught *-3 at home , \[ \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] \+ and \] respect for other people .

95729:28	###SpeakerB88 . ###And I think , N_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###because I think 0 my husband was not quite as , uh , good at *-1 saving and so on before we got married *-2 E_S ###and \[ I was , \+ I was \] really diligent about that .

97841:4	###SpeakerA9 . ###That was excellent . E_S ###It was just \[ a really , \+ a really \] funny movie . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###That is one 0 I 've been dying *-1 to see *T*-2 .

97858:4	###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh , it 's still on , to the best of my knowledge . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###But , I mean , time wise , how long , E_S ###was it two hour E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###or , N_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
97877:24	###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but this one , it was fairly long . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes , maybe . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh , E_S ###and , uh , it , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###But excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby , E_S 
97894:9	###oh , Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Oh , great . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###So we really enjoyed that .

98085:24	###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh .

98172:35	###SpeakerA2 . ###Well , it depends where in Dallas you are *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###There are certainly parts of town 0 I would not want *-1 to live in *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Because it 's the situation E_S

E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
98212:36	###SpeakerB17 . ###Yeah , E_S ###something like that . E_S ###No one 's , you know , N_S ###\[ or , \+ or \] fathers are just missing , you know , E_S ###so there 's \[ no , \+ uh , no \] consistency there in the home or whatever .

98257:16	###SpeakerA34 . ###Well , the thing is , 0 I do n't , N_S ###it 's one of those things where , if you 're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on N_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###Unfortunately there are often these correlations that *T*-1 are inverse of what they should be *T*-2 like , uh , wherever there are more , uh , criminals *T*-3 , there are more policemen E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Yeah .

98264:41	###SpeakerB37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###but that 's which *T*-1 came first . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###But , on the other side of it is N_S ###\[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \+ basically \[ the , \+ the \] problem is \] \[ within the , \+ in the \] society and the society 's views E_S ###SpeakerB41 .

98298:49	###uh , so it 's effected all of us . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 \[ they , \+ the drug culture \] definitely \[ has , \+ uh , is \] one of the main problems . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ our , \+ uh , our \] mayor in , uh , Baltimore is one of the people that *T*-1 goes on national television and says 0 they should , uh , legalize drugs .

E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . 
98332:4	###SpeakerA66 . ###Uh , y- , N_S ###well , the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side , N_S ###and I think 0 if I look back fifty or a hundred years I 'd say 0 , you know , back then there were the opium dens E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###but the thing is , 0 if somebody ruined their life , uh , society did n't try *-1 to then save themselves from it , E_S ###they let this person who *T*-1 had ruined it uh , \[ become , \+ well , die \] or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . 
98341:18	###SpeakerB69 . ###Uh-huh .

98361:103	###SpeakerB77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###SpeakerB79 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well I think 0 you know , they did that in Alaska . \[ That , \+ that \] actually , Alaska just recently legalized marijuana . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###Uh , Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###SpeakerA82 . 
98412:43	###Of course uh , I work for lawyers a lot E_S ###SpeakerB95 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###\[ That , \+ I think that , \] uh , the drunk driving has \[ just \+ actually , just \] caught on .

98503:20	###SpeakerB133 . ###Well , see Maryland is one of the most , N_S ###we just voted in , uh , \[ gun control , \+ strong gun control \] here in the state of Maryland . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] guess because I work quite a bit with lawyers , I 'm not a lawyer , uh , that *T*-1 I find 0 a lot of things are so specialized that I 'm not sure , E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I \] look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense \[ of , \+ of \] the value of , and worth , so that they have real problems when it comes to , uh , uh *T*-1 , N_S 
98513:125	###they can find guilt or innocence E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Right .

98518:15	###SpeakerB5 . ###Right , E_S ###I agree , too . E_S ###I do n't think 0 the jury should be the ones \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 put the \[ sense- , \+ sentencings \] down .

98524:128	###SpeakerA6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###SpeakerA8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Because I find that , uh , N_S ###I 've been on a few juries E_S ###and , uh , as a say , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-1 to be around , uh , civil cases because I 've been an expert witness some , N_S ###and , uh , many matters are so complicated that it *EXP*-1 's so hard * to , uh , come up with the fair value , uh , or the fair sentence E_S ###and one thing that you get *T*-2 if you have some expertise is , uh , you know the range \[ of , \+ of \] possible values or terms or , you know , how heinous was the crime *T*-1 . E_S 
98534:108	###SpeakerB9 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Uh , that , uh , N_S ###when I only do something one , two or three times *T*-1 I 'm hardly an expert on it , E_S ###and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three .

98545:9	###SpeakerB13 . ###Right , E_S ###that 's , N_S ###yeah . E_S ###\[ And , \+ and \] most people that *T*-1 do sit on juries , N_S ###some people just sit on them once in their lifetime , you know , if they 're that lucky sometimes .

98551:93	###SpeakerA14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###SpeakerA16 . ###Yeah .

98733:49	###SpeakerA27 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 some of the dress codes are different at different schools .

98790:31	###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###That , N_S ###so that 's , N_S ###and I do n't know , you know , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think about , well , the dress code 0 they have *T*-1 for the kids , you know .

98832:40	###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah , E_S ###there 's a couple teachers up there \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 do dress up more than others . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB66 .

98858:33	###I , N_S ###some of those male coaches , that might really , N_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Right . E_S ###They go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Right , E_S ###and a T-shirt . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###SpeakerA77 . 
98886:21	###SpeakerB84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###That 's what I would think *T*-1 .

98929:44	###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh .

99065:57	###And , uh , one thing that I did *T*-1 this summer , which I thought 0 *T*-2 might benefit both my daughters is , 0 my youngest daughter got involved *-3 in band , E_S ###and Baylor has a band camp .

99403:72	###SpeakerB60 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###well , \[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] toward Ann Arbor , E_S ###so it 's probably out in that direction , E_S ###but that 's the only one 0 I probably could name *T*-1 after all these years E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh .

99425:22	###I said 0 I was n't close to downtown Pontiac , E_S ###I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles \[ from , \+ from \] the city limits E_S ###and it was really nice out there .

99447:29	###SpeakerB76 . ###Right , E_S ###right E_S ###in the summertime they have musicals there E_S ###and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###That 's right , E_S ###that 's right . E_S ###I know , 0 we used *-1 to , N_S ###\[ we , \+ we \] did n't do a lot of it , E_S 
99490:12	###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###You know , because they were from Alabama where it never snowed *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Oh .

99535:10	###SpeakerA105 . ###No , E_S ###that 's not fun either , E_S ###so , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] just as soon *ICH*-1 have all the slushy snow on the streets than * have the ice on the streets E_S ###\[ so , \+ But , \] uh , well we have , N_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###SpeakerA107 . ###our house is kind of on a little hill , E_S ###so , uh , we get the sled out E_S ###and , uh , the kids go down \[ the hi- , \+ the hill \] on the sleds when it 's icy *T*-1 , E_S

E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###And she got kind of fearful of *-1 being on her own . E_S ###She never really ate very well . E_S ###It was one thing . E_S ###She hardly ever took care of herself E_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
100018:40	###SpeakerB24 . ###Well , she was almost ridiculous . E_S ###Like she 'd eat ice cream and cookies . E_S ###She 'd , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yes . E_S ###Well you know that 's part of the aging process , That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Did n't one , N_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
100054:37	###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###So as a family you all just visited nursing homes E_S ###or probably in College Station there was n't a whole lot of choice . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###No , E_S ###I do n't think 0 there was *?* . Um , E_S 
100121:39	###but \[ the , \+ the \] places like Presbyterian Village and some of \[ the , \+ the \] retirement places \[ where , \+ where \] they have different levels of care *T*-1 seems *-2 to be so much better , as far as elderly people adapting .

E_S 
100166:22	###She 's going *-1 to endanger herself before she 'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision . E_S ###And that scares me \[ the , \+ the \] thought of * forcing somebody to do something . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###But \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] so lonely , E_S ###you know they ca n't get out and see anyone E_S ###and I mean , it *EXP*-1 's hard \[ for , \+ for \] someone like me to understand that E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah .

100176:35	###It 's a house , E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###it 's walls E_S ###and it 's furniture E_S ###but there 's nobody there . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Not as independence . E_S ###SpeakerB84 .

100214:18	###SpeakerA97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###What *ICH*-1 does that house got *T*-2 attraction ? E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Well , they fear *-1 being dependent on somebody .

E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###My husband 's mother will have major surgery E_S 
100239:10	###SpeakerA107 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , \[ she stayed , \+ she stayed \] in a temporary nursing home . Until she was okay . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###Oh .

100286:55	###SpeakerB7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###Um , what do you think *T*-1 about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two , N_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###I think 0 it 's a good idea .

E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###I just , um , N_S 
100298:56	###SpeakerA12 . ###I just , um , N_S ###I guess 0 \[ that 's MUMBLEx , my , \+ that 's something that my \] family has always believed strongly in *T*-1 , E_S ###and , uh , I had opportunities in high school , * to work in some programs , um E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###SpeakerA14 . ###SpeakerB15 . ###Did you ? E_S ###Oh ! . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . 
100309:31	###SpeakerB17 . ###SpeakerA18 . ###SpeakerB19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###and \[ \[ I , \+ uh , I , \] \+ I \] think 0 it gives you a better perspective , on life E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###SpeakerA22 . ###and , uh , it gives you a little bit , uh , more a glimpse of \[ the , \+ the \] real world E_S ###\[ and \+ and \] it would certainly help the country , too , uh . E_S 
100330:125	###SpeakerA28 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###SpeakerA30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , I think 0 sometimes through groups and organizations , um , N_S ###\[ \[ \[ my first , \+ when I first thought of it *T*-1 , \] \+ I thought 0 it , \] \+ uh , when they asked the question *T*-2 I thought , \] well that sounds wonderful .

E_S ###Um , but I do know 0 through some organized groups like Scouts and church um , they , do still have opportunities . E_S 
100337:84	###And then , I wondered if people were unwilling E_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] I think 0 even if you went in with a negative attitude I do n't think 0 it would stay negative very long .

E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###SpeakerB33 . ###SpeakerA34 . ###SpeakerB35 . ###Yeah , E_S 
100373:22	###What part of the country ? E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###Well , I live in Richardson *ICH*-2 right now . Which *T*-1 is just , N_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###We 're in Plano E_S ###so we 're not far apart . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S 
100376:33	###SpeakerA48 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###We 're in Plano E_S ###so we 're not far apart . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###okay . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###One of the calls 0 I 'd gotten *T*-1 before was , uh , down to Austin E_S 
100429:31	###but I think 0 by the time 0 they 're , oh , early teenagers anyway *T*-1 , I think 0 it 's too late now . At least around here . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I think , \+ uh , I think \] 0 it does help , um , even preschoolers , you know E_S ###they 're , um , things even just * starting around the home . You know E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###little ones can do a little bit *-1 to help the family . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . 
100443:24	###and then that helps *-1 develop that attitude . E_S ###Um , I guess 0 I would really like *-1 to see this happen with families more . E_S ###You know , I think 0 this is certainly a possible way , um , 0 * to handle it *T*-1 E_S ###but I wish , MUMBLEx N_S ###that 's something that I think that *T*-1 has been lost *-2 in families E_S ###and I think 0 that 's a good place 0 * to start again *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I think 0 it has *-1 to start in the families first because if you do n't do it \[ for , \+ for \] your own immediate family , you 're sure not going *-2 to do it for anybody else . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . 
100457:17	###I mean when you live in areas like that where there 's so much *T*-2 *T*-3 they do n't realize what a small percentage of the world that is *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###I mean , that 's , uh , N_S ###gosh I 'm sure , 0 not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas E_S ###and , uh it 's , N_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###That 's probably true . E_S ###That 's probably true . E_S 
100458:13	###SpeakerB73 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###I mean , that 's , uh , N_S ###gosh I 'm sure , 0 not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas E_S ###and , uh it 's , N_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###That 's probably true . E_S ###That 's probably true . E_S ###SpeakerA76 .

100543:69	###SpeakerA3 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###But from * talking to people in other districts there are some major problems , uh , with dropouts . E_S ###Uh , when I was in Minnesota last summer *T*-1 there was a teacher who *T*-2 said that , uh , on a given day she did n't know how many of her students *T*-3 would show up E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###and sometimes they did n't even show up for class E_S ###and she taught in high school in inner city , uh , Minneapolis . E_S 
100548:10	###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###and sometimes they did n't even show up for class E_S ###and she taught in high school in inner city , uh , Minneapolis . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###And , uh , they just did n't come to school . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
100548:47	###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###and sometimes they did n't even show up for class E_S ###and she taught in high school in inner city , uh , Minneapolis . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###And , uh , they just did n't come to school . E_S ###SpeakerA9 .

100561:48	###SpeakerA11 . ###Right . E_S ###Well just recently in the paper here , were *T*-4 articles about students , uh , working . High school students that *T*-1 work and the percentage of hours that they work *T*-2 and how that affects their grades *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###But then the follow-up the next day was , N_S ###I was kind of glad *-1 to see , N_S ###because \[ it , \+ it \] said that , you know , N_S ###yes E_S 
100564:107	###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###But then the follow-up the next day was , N_S ###I was kind of glad *-1 to see , N_S ###because \[ it , \+ it \] said that , you know , N_S ###yes E_S ###but for those students who *T*-1 are determined *-2 to do well anyway , that , you know , * handling a job was very possible .

100572:16	###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###SpeakerB16 . ###I think so too . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###You know like , what are their plans after high school *T*-1 , you know . E_S ###And what 's their home situation *T*-1 . E_S ###You know that , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###The home is the key . E_S 
100578:17	###And what 's their home situation *T*-1 . E_S ###You know that , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###The home is the key . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###I think really is *?* because if the home , does not place a high priority on education N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . 
100579:6	###You know that , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###The home is the key . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###I think really is *?* because if the home , does not place a high priority on education N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 .

100613:8	###It 's what *T*-1 's wrong with families . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###That 's right .

100663:63	###But , you know , part of my feeling is that if you \[ solve , \+ help \] them to work through their problems while they 're littler , then they wo n't have as many problems up there .

100712:28	###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###What *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen to them ?

103917:25	###Pop bottles all had a deposit on them . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###Oh , of course . E_S ###That , they did . E_S ###You know actually , we had milk delivered *-1 to our house in glass bottles E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Oh . E_S 
103917:58	###Pop bottles all had a deposit on them . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###Oh , of course . E_S ###That , they did . E_S ###You know actually , we had milk delivered *-1 to our house in glass bottles E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Oh . E_S 
103933:31	###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###and so you just put the empty ones back out there E_S ###and he took them away and \[ put , \+ you know , put \] another gallon of \[ glass , \+ glass \] bottle in there . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###So , uh , yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
103957:70	###* seems like \[ there 's a pretty well , \+ there 's a \[ p- , \+ pretty \] continual flow \] of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###so that 's kind of encouraging . E_S ###\[ I did n't know , \+ you know , I did n't know \] if we started *-1 to do that . E_S ###I did n't know what *-2 to expect *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well I 'll have *-1 to say 0 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm , \] the only one 0 I 'm good at *T*-2 at this point is the newspaper .

103964:16	###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well I 'll have *-1 to say 0 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm , \] the only one 0 I 'm good at *T*-2 at this point is the newspaper .

104028:58	###\[ And , \+ and , \] uh , uh , I 'm not really say going back to good old days , E_S ###but certainly we were doing things the way 0 we think 0 we should do them now *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###well , N_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Well , it *EXP*-1 will be interesting * to see how , over the next year , this all works out *T*-2 because , like on the , uh , grass , \[ I 'm , \+ I \] know 0 your husband , uh , does n't really like the paper sacks . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###No , E_S 
104036:36	###SpeakerA61 . ###No , E_S ###he does n't like the paper sacks E_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ uh , but he , \] \+ but , you know , he \] likes *-1 to pick the grass up , too .

104048:39	###but I do n't believe in * throwing it into \[ the , \+ uh , the \] landfill , E_S ###so I have my compost pile , E_S ###but most of us do n't have the , uh , sufficient , lot size *-1 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] do that . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh , so I 'm glad 0 the city 's willing *-1 to take that on . E_S 
104062:11	###SpeakerB70 . ###Well , there 's someplace , you know , E_S ###if it 's , N_S ###because really , when I look at what my grass does *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] actually about twenty-four hours *T*-3 , uh , *-4 knowing what the farmers do *T*-2 in rural areas , ###they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it ###and it naturally , uh , composts or stores E_S ###and , uh , so all 0 you have *-1 to do *T*-2 is * just place it somewhere and churn it E_S ###and it will naturally decompose , uh , E_S ###so you just have *-1 to kind of keep in separated E_S ###and then , uh , who *T*-1 knows how they process it from there *T*-2 and what they turn it into *T*-3 , E_S 
104072:16	###but it 's certainly usable material . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###well \[ they must , \+ they must \] keep it separate if they have this date in .

104086:28	###SpeakerA75 . ###No .

104103:29	###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah , E_S ###now \[ I ha- , \+ I have n't \] seen THE TERMINATOR movie , E_S ###\[ but , \+ and \] that 's kind of blood and guts , is n't it . E_S ###I do n't particularly care for that sort of stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , I do n't either . E_S 
104175:26	###Yeah , E_S ###we 've got *-1 to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late * to watch it *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###So , We saw , uh , \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , movie with , uh , Sylvester Stallone , OSCAR . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 .

104192:4	###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I know 0 my daughter saw that E_S ###and she liked it E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Did she ? E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
104217:52	###\[ and , \+ ###because \] I have a ten year old E_S ###so , \[ We , \+ we \] watch a lot of movies around that category , you know \[ that she , \+ that she \] can watch *T*-1 .

104308:41	###SpeakerA87 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###but , other than that it just seems like it 's so expensive . E_S ###And then the popcorn and everything else , E_S ###you almost ca n't afford *-1 to do it . No matter what . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Although we did actually get , N_S 
104314:39	###SpeakerA89 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Although we did actually get , N_S ###we went on vacation couple months ago , E_S ###and we got *-1 to go *-2 see WHAT ABOUT BOB ?

104320:30	###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###That was kind of a funny movie with , uh , Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###That was fun . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Golly , E_S 
104338:44	###SpeakerB98 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###the house explodes ? E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . 
104369:58	###and we were doing all right there until , uh , the price dropped out E_S ###and they were n't worth anything anymore . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###And we , N_S ###it took us , almost a year *-1 to get a garbage sack full . E_S ###We just do n't drink that many . E_S ###So as far as at home use , uh , we 'll pick up a six pack *ICH*-1 every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] by the time 0 we gathered up enough crushed cans * to take it in *T*-1 , uh , N_S 
104396:21	###Least it gets back into the system , E_S ###but , as far as a habit at the house , uh , I have n't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants *-2 to pick *T*-1 up . E_S ###Have you all got the individual containers yet ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###No , E_S ###I read in the paper this week where maybe , N_S ###I do n't know if it \[ w- , \+ was , \] N_S ###I guess 0 maybe this week someone may start *-1 getting them if the truck that *T*-2 picks them up is outfitted *-3 in time . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Um . E_S 
104398:67	###Have you all got the individual containers yet ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###No , E_S ###I read in the paper this week where maybe , N_S ###I do n't know if it \[ w- , \+ was , \] N_S ###I guess 0 maybe this week someone may start *-1 getting them if the truck that *T*-2 picks them up is outfitted *-3 in time .

104402:24	###I do n't know if it \[ w- , \+ was , \] N_S ###I guess 0 maybe this week someone may start *-1 getting them if the truck that *T*-2 picks them up is outfitted *-3 in time .

E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###But , \[ it , \+ it \] should be starting , I would stay probably in the next month \[ if , \+ if \] everything goes that , N_S ###I 'm not sure all what we 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do *T*-3 , whether we have three separate containers , E_S ###I really do n't understand that part on what they 've told you *-1 to separate everything *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Right . E_S 
104409:18	###I really do n't understand that part on what they 've told you *-1 to separate everything *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###it seemed like , uh , N_S ###\[ if , \+ if \] I recall , it 's been a long time . E_S ###They 're way behind schedule on that particular part of it . E_S ###They were fine on the \[ green , \+ big green containers \] E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
104410:28	###SpeakerA11 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###it seemed like , uh , N_S ###\[ if , \+ if \] I recall , it 's been a long time . E_S ###They 're way behind schedule on that particular part of it . E_S ###They were fine on the \[ green , \+ big green containers \] E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . 
104426:103	###But when it comes down to just general purpose trash , that all the houses , uh *T*-1 , N_S ###the success rate of * getting it sorted *-1 properly seemed *-2 to be poor , E_S ###so they felt that * having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better \[ than , \+ than \] * having a household try it . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###But \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know , E_S ###that sounds like an awful lot of labor * to sort the entire week 's worth of trash for a house . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Well , it would get messy , too . E_S 
104441:46	###they have *-4 to , like , wash out their glass jars and whatnot . \[ And , \+ \] uh , which we 're not in the habit of *-2 doing *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###I was brought *-1 up , uh , you know , long time ago , that they did n't even have cans . E_S ###They had bottles E_S ###and you 'd return them to the the grocery store E_S 
104442:65	###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###I was brought *-1 up , uh , you know , long time ago , that they did n't even have cans . E_S ###They had bottles E_S ###and you 'd return them to the the grocery store E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
104472:59	###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and they , uh , p- , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 kids do n't appreciate , maybe the value of money , that it 's so little that they do n't care , E_S ###they can get more somewhere else . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . 
104496:23	###so I would say 0 in the last three years , we 've probably used a lot more cans than ever before . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh , it *EXP*-1 was just easier *ICH*-2 * to do that than * to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###So that 's the main reason 0 \[ we 're , \+ we , sort of are \] into cans *ICH*-1 at this point rather than the liter bottles . E_S 
104508:4	###SpeakerB44 . ###Well , as you say , it takes a while * to build it up . E_S ###Since we 've had the crusher all summer , \[ we \+ , I guess 0 we \] just now maybe have a bag full that we have n't ta- , ###oh , N_S I think 0 the kids , when we were on vacation *T*-1 , they said 0 they did take them to \[ a , \+ a \] recycling place , probably at one of the li- , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###do you subscribe to magazines yourself ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###I do n't , uh , subscribe to any magazines at home , because we get so many *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 at work that , uh , I need *-1 to read *T*-2 that , uh , I just do n't take any at home .

104512:29	###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###do you subscribe to magazines yourself ?

104525:54	###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###And , uh , I read magazines mainly because they 're fast E_S and if I want *-1 to relax while I watch T V , E_S ###of course , I 'm one of those that *T*-1 does two things at once , E_S 
104525:109	###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Right .

104558:58	###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###I do n't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with *T*-1 uh , on a general basis , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh .

104575:32	###I 'm , \[ re- , \+ read \] it fast and put it down . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###\[ When , \+ when \] I had my magazines at home *T*-1 , I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures , you know , E_S ###and if something caught my eye , then I might read something , E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right .

104580:17	###and if something caught my eye , then I might read something , E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###but otherwise than that , you know , they were , uh , you know , not too useful to me . You know E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Well , That 's what I do *T*-1 .

104587:16	###SpeakerB32 . ###I got some good recipes from them sometimes , E_S ###but N_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###You clip recipes E_S ###and you save them forever E_S ###and you never really use them . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . 
104603:15	###SpeakerB38 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###But , uh , that 's mainly my , uh , whole idea on you know , short subject , uh , reading and things like this . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] subscribe , like I said , to a few E_S ###and once in a while I buy that new magazine called * FIRST *ICH*-1 on the newsstands or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
104616:31	###SpeakerB44 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . ###Well , since I work with computers during my work , I have *-1 to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything .

E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right . E_S 
104641:14	###I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we , N_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###no matter what it is *T*-1 , ###air travel or anything ###and I , N_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Right . E_S

104660:11	###Now see your computer ones , N_S ###I got into computer work somewhat , uh , E_S ###we have our own computer system at home E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
104672:42	###so I never did get into them . E_S ###\[ I \+ , when I \] bought the computer *T*-1 , all of a sudden I was receiving them , for some unknown reason , through the mail .

E_S ###My father was on staff there , E_S ###and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats , sailboats , speedboats , E_S ###you name it , they had it E_S ###and we did a lot of \[ watering , \+ , water sports . \] E_S 
105001:163	###and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it . E_S ###If you ever got it dumped *-1 over , though , it was a mess 0 * to get *T*-2 back up .

105020:4	###or current , N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , about the only memories that I have *T*-1 of boating , uh , N_S ###my husband 's family had \[ a , \+ a \] motor boat , uh , when we got engaged *-2 *T*-1 E_S ###and they took us out on the lake several times .

E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know that I ever learned *-1 to drive it or anything , E_S ###but , uh , we did some water skiing *ICH*-1 , of course , \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , * driving around the lake in the boat ###\[ and , \+ and \] just the basic safety rules and things I found *T*-1 real interesting .

105042:18	###I guess 0 I was seven or eight years old E_S ###and the lake that we learned on *T*-1 was the smaller of the two that we had access to *T*-2 E_S ###and it was maybe fifteen , twenty acres E_S ###and \[ it was , \+ uh , it had \] a lot of , uh , turtles in it . E_S ###And I got all ready *-1 to go E_S ###and I was down in the water \[ and , \+ and \] set *-1 to go E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , and \] just as that boat took off , a turtle bit me in the middle of the back . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
105054:19	###And the boat went off without me E_S ###and I reached back there and \[ s- , \+ \] pushed him away and got out of the water \[ a , \+ a \] while E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , it did n't even leave a mark . E_S ###It was just a little nibble E_S ###and so I told everybody what *T*-1 happened E_S ###and they go , oh , yeah , sure , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###And so I get back down in there E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] I 'll be if he did n't do it again . E_S 
105059:19	###and they go , oh , yeah , sure , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###And so I get back down in there E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] I 'll be if he did n't do it again .

105067:66	###* Did n't go very far , E_S ###but I got up .

105454:10	###That , N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Right , E_S ###I N_S ###at T I , if you get called *-1 in and you test positive for drugs , then you 're put *-2 on a program E_S ###and , uh , you know , you go through the program E_S ###and then you 're called *-1 like six months after you complete the \[ pro- , \+ program \] E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
105494:76	###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] it would be , uh , you know , out of the question . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
105540:19	###\[ and , \+ and \] I think 0 that 's good because so many of the kids that *T*-4 are on them are sort of bums that *T*-3 they need *-1 to get their life straightened *-2 up at an early age E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
105552:54	###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###You know , I think 0 personally I 'm for it . E_S ###There 's several reason why \[ I , \+ I \] could think of *T*-1 right now why we should n't have it *T*-2 such as drug testing , E_S they say , runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time 0 you do it *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And , N_S 
105558:17	###SpeakerB66 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###It 's that high ? E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yes . E_S ###And , oh , yeah , E_S ###it 's very expensive . E_S 
105558:57	###SpeakerB66 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###It 's that high ? E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yes . E_S ###And , oh , yeah , E_S ###it 's very expensive . E_S 
105619:43	###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###I can see 0 if , N_S ###because , you know , if it 's a thousand dollars , that 's a thousand dollars 0 they wasted *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Theirs might not run a thousand dollars . E_S ###Our , N_S ###from what I understanding *T*-1 here at T I , they run close to a thousand dollars an employee . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . 
105628:8	###SpeakerB96 . ###Well , maybe they run , N_S ###I do n't know , you know , E_S ###that 's just guessing it . E_S ###Maybe they run a lot of other tests , E_S ###or maybe it 's under a health type program that *T*-1 \[ \[ it \+ it , \] \+ it \] would catch a lot of things . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###SpeakerA99 . 
105654:4	###SpeakerB4 . ###China painting and ceramics . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Ooh , how great . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###I enjoy it . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Oh , uh , ceramic painting . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
105671:4	###That sounds so interesting . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###My husband kept *-1 begging me , E_S ###and he 's been dead now for twenty years , E_S ###so you understand that this was a long time ago .

105685:34	###And it has just been the most relaxing , enjoyable , self-satisfying thing 0 I 've had *T*-1 . E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Now , do you do it just for yourself , E_S ###or do you do it *-1 to give as gifts , E_S ###or do you actually sell it ? E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###I have sold quite a bit . E_S ###I give a lot to our two daughters that *T*-1 are grown and have their home , E_S ###and then I just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it . E_S 
105744:17	###SpeakerB34 . ###Well , my sister is the seamstress of the two of us . E_S ###\[ And , \+ but \] she does n't china paint E_S ###so we both have our expertise side .

E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh , Houston 's , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
105901:66	###SpeakerB28 . ###Do you like Mexican ? E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Do you like Mexican food . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Not particularly E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 .

E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###But in the Addison , well about everything that you could want *T*-1 in Dallas is in the Addison area , anyway . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . 
105963:32	###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###Oh I 've had , N_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Magic Time Machine is the place 0 you 're thinking of *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###That 's it , E_S ###that 's it . E_S 
105976:22	###the people drove me crazy first of all E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###True . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###True . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###but then I just thought 0 the food was over priced for what it was *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
105984:39	###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###all right , E_S ###well , that 's great . E_S ###Uh , no , E_S ###Italian is fine . E_S ###I make it a habit of * always going out to Pasta Oggi 's which *T*-1 is right down there in Ad- , N_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Do you \[ like , \+ like \] Southwestern ? E_S 
105992:48	###SpeakerB62 . ###Do you \[ like , \+ like \] Southwestern ? E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Well , now there 's a good place *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 in Addison too called * Blue Mesa Grill that *T*-1 's on Belt Line that *T*-2 's close to Houston 's , as a matter of fact . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###All right . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . 
106008:20	###but I went there recently , E_S ###and I thought , Well , this really is good . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###So \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a very good place 0 * to eat *T*-1 , The Blue Mesa Grill . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Good . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###And , um , N_S 
106039:37	###SpeakerB82 . ###SpeakerA83 . ###SpeakerB84 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###and other than that , they , you know , leave you go about five minutes , E_S ###and then , \[ that , \+ that 's \] about it . E_S ###I guess 0 that 's what they need *T*-1 for their machines to get everything down pat , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB86 . 
106047:21	###so . N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Okay , E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###It *EXP*-1 was a pleasure * talking to you . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Well , thanks for * calling for * helping us out . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . 
106065:4	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I do n't feel very good about it , E_S ###but I think that at some times it can be the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S ###We sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of * caring for himself anymore *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###He actually died a few months after that , E_S ###and so as , N_S ###at least in retrospect , it was the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S 
106069:35	###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###He actually died a few months after that , E_S ###and so as , N_S ###at least in retrospect , it was the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S ###because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . 
106081:7	###SpeakerB8 . ###Um , well , the , see , uh , well , N_S ###\[ we , \+ he \] wanted *-1 to get into a Mennonite nursing home which *T*-2 is very popular and hard 0 * to get into *T*-3 and had like a ten year waiting list E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Oh , my . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###right , E_S ###we wound up just *-3 choosing \[ a , \+ another \] Mennonite nursing home that *T*-1 was easier 0 * to get into *T*-2 . E_S ###\[ Or \+ but \] naturally , N_S ###no , E_S 
106081:31	###SpeakerB8 . ###Um , well , the , see , uh , well , N_S ###\[ we , \+ he \] wanted *-1 to get into a Mennonite nursing home which *T*-2 is very popular and hard 0 * to get into *T*-3 and had like a ten year waiting list E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Oh , my .

E_S ###\[ Or \+ but \] naturally , N_S ###no , E_S ###it was even Mennonite related , E_S ###I 'm sorry , it was actually not a particularly great nursing home . E_S ###Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it *T*-1 , because he suddenly got sick and needed *-2 to be put *-3 in . E_S 
106094:29	###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###SpeakerA13 . ###so the convenience , N_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh , what do you think *T*-1 ? E_S 
106104:9	###SpeakerA17 . ###My grandmother lived with us , um , until August , um , E_S ###and we made the decision * to put her in a nursing home . E_S ###She has leukemia E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###and \[ her , \+ the rest of her \] family and her regular doctors and everybody 0 she trusted *T*-1 and knew *T*-1 was in Dayton , and were several thousand miles away E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S 
106117:47	###She had her own little room and did n't have *-1 to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and T V set E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###yeah , E_S ###that 's important I would say 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yes . E_S 
106143:28	###SpeakerB32 . ###Right , ###so that , N_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Right , E_S ###and that becomes difficult then . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###So . E_S 
106159:57	###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yep , E_S ###we tried *-1 to convince my grandfather *-2 to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life , E_S ###but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could *?* E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
106188:23	###It *EXP*-1 sure would n't have been Granny 's decision * to leave us and go back to a nursing home , E_S ###but she 's accepted it real well now E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Right E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###so . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###well \[ that 's , \+ yeah , that 's \] right that the children have some responsibility *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 , too , to their parents and such , * to help * decide what *T*-2 's the right thing . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Well , we enjoyed *-1 having her here , E_S 
106196:105	###SpeakerA55 . ###Well , we enjoyed *-1 having her here , E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###And . N_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###but we feel 0 she 's much safer where she is *T*-1 now . E_S ###She still continues *-1 to fall , E_S ###but when she does *T*-1 \[ there , \+ \] a nurse is right there * to help her E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
106202:28	###She still continues *-1 to fall , E_S ###but when she does *T*-1 \[ there , \+ \] a nurse is right there * to help her E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###and I know 0 she 's eating the right things , E_S ###and her doctor 's right there where he can come in and check on her *T*-1 , E_S ###so . It *ICH*-2 became dangerous for us * to keep *-1 transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yep . E_S 
106204:7	###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###and I know 0 she 's eating the right things , E_S ###and her doctor 's right there where he can come in and check on her *T*-1 , E_S ###so . It *ICH*-2 became dangerous for us * to keep *-1 transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###so , I think 0 she 'll adjust , E_S 
106209:21	###so .

E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Yeah , E_S ###this is a great topic for me , because I just did my first two painting projects ever . E_S 
106227:5	###SpeakerB8 . ###two little deals , N_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###The first one , um , N_S ###I helped someone repaint an apartment , E_S ###and it was very easy . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###\[ it , \+ was it *?* ? \] E_S 
106258:15	###SpeakerB20 . ###Well , \[ \[ it 's , \+ uh , it , \] \+ that 's \] half the problem right there is that \[ it was n't , \+ it was \] a oil base , E_S ###so I had *-1 to get , N_S ###and when I painted them *T*-1 , I did n't realize that we did n't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house . E_S ###So I \[ had it , \+ had it \] all over my hands . E_S ###At first I did n't realize , you know , N_S ###I had never painted anything , E_S ###so I did n't realize that I needed that . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
106262:7	###So I \[ had it , \+ had it \] all over my hands . E_S ###At first I did n't realize , you know , N_S ###I had never painted anything , E_S ###so I did n't realize that I needed that . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###I mean , I kind of knew , in the back of my mind , E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###So you ca n't use oil on wood ? E_S 
106297:30	###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] \[ it , \+ it \] just like N_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###the same with the toys , N_S ###it *EXP*-1 's just important * to look for one that *T*-2 does n't have lead in it , you know , E_S ###it says Safe for Children , and all that . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . 
106329:14	###and , uh , I had this big five gallon jug , E_S ###and it was like paint thinner . E_S ###I mean \[ I , \+ you know , it \] looked just like , it was the viscosity of paint thinner E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###but , uh , you just took a roller and put it on there , E_S ###and , uh , if you saw that the wood was getting wet , you know , \[ that was , \+ that was \] all 0 you needed *T*-1 . E_S ###So . N_S ###SpeakerB46 . 
106434:9	###SpeakerB76 . ###Well , a couple of week ends E_S ###we would go down two or three hours on the weekends , E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###So there was two of you all ? E_S ###SpeakerB80 . 
106447:53	###SpeakerA81 . ###Well , that 's easy enough . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###So , there 's a whole bunch of people . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###So now I feel like if I ever buy a house , I can probably paint , if nothing else . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###I think 0 I could probably do it uh , 
106458:28	###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###SpeakerB88 . ###But you know , I went in to a hardware store *-1 to get paint for those toys , E_S ###and the guy said , Oh , * get this , ###it 's a nice shiny gloss , which *T*-1 was true , E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###SpeakerB90 . ###but I did n't realize what , you know , pain it *EXP*-2 is *T*-1 * to clean the brushes and everything , if you do n't have latex E_S 
106465:23	###SpeakerA89 . ###SpeakerB90 . ###but I did n't realize what , you know , pain it *EXP*-2 is *T*-1 * to clean the brushes and everything , if you do n't have latex E_S ###I do n't if N_S ###it 's worth the shine , E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh-huh .

106499:20	###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###so \[ I , \+ I \] manage it .

106514:40	###and so \[ we , \+ we , \] um , set aside a certain amount *ICH*-1 each week that *T*-2 goes for things that *T*-3 have *-4 to be paid for *-5 , you know , E_S ###just our bills .

106549:35	###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah .

106761:22	###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
106765:31	###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###And for most of , uh , N_S

106793:11	###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah .

106799:15	###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###and that was a real eye opener . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###\[ It , \+ it \] is *?* when you do it that way *T*-1 . E_S

106809:29	###SpeakerA67 . ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh .

107178:17	###SpeakerA5 . ###Oh , my . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And I , N_S ###so I mean , how I would go about *-1 doing it *T*-2 is I would just call all my relatives . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh .

107195:15	###but it 's real different . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###And I grew up in a real \[ not , \+ I think 0 *T*-1 not \] normal setting .

107704:49	###SpeakerA47 . ###And , It 's really more of \[ a , \+ um , like a \] respect issue \[ th- , \+ \] that the \[ older , \+ older \] people in other countries that I 've been to *T*-2 seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] they really seem as wise E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] in this country \[ nobody really , \+ Yeah , nobody really \] pays attention E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###They 're seen *-1 as senile .

112773:74	###I have no interest , for example , in *-1 taking a cruise . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###To me why somebody would want *-1 to ride around on a boat for a few days *T*-2 is mind boggling . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###It would be sort of , N_S ###I feel like it would be confining . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah . E_S 
112778:11	###SpeakerA63 . ###It would be sort of , N_S ###I feel like it would be confining . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###You know I would \[ rather \+ much rather \] get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . 
112797:88	###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , I like that kind of stuff . E_S ###I could just sit there all day and look at the scenery . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Yes .

112823:17	###but she 's , uh a very picky eater E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Uh-huh .

113041:7	###and we all ran out and bought the records , E_S ###and now we feel like they 're kind of a collector 's item . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah .

113068:16	###SpeakerB5 . ###I think 0 they get a lot of people in trouble . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Yeah , E_S ###definitely . E_S ###I have one right now E_S ###and , um , I just got it about \[ eight , \+ six \] months ago E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . 
113089:21	###SpeakerA12 . ###Oh , my goodness . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###\[ And then , \+ you know , so \] I eventually got it all paid *-1 . E_S ###Now I carry one .

113107:40	###so . N_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###SpeakerB21 . ###That 's a good idea . ###* Stops all them interest rates , E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###That 's , N_S ###SpeakerB23 . 
113199:35	###We just waited until time *ICH*-2 come around that we could afford it *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###And you know , we had all the necessities , E_S ###so . And I very seldom use a credit card on necessities . E_S ###I always use it for something 0 I want *T*-1 not something 0 I need *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA54 . ###Exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . 
113220:102	###SpeakerA60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###Of course , we would n't have the retail market 0 we have *T*-1 either E_S ###so I guess 0 they trade one for the other . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###I disagree with it , E_S ###but they still trade one for the other . E_S 
113252:4	###like last weekend was homecoming E_S ###and I needed a pair of shoes E_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . ###so I just went out and bought them \[ and \+ \] on my credit card . E_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###I did n't really have the money 0 * to do it *T*-1 E_S 
113295:4	###SpeakerA88 . ###They 're giving us a lot of time . E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA90 . ###SpeakerB91 . ###\[ They may not , \+ they must not \] have too much traffic on Saturdays . E_S ###SpeakerA92 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Have you done a lot of this ? E_S 
113338:39	###and in light of these , uh , hearings 0 we 've all been sitting through *T*-1 the last two weeks , we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed .

E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###And the other thing is , uh , besides that 0 I think , uh , 0 two things that * very definitely need * looking at *T*-1 , one is foreign aid . E_S ###I have a real problem with all the foreign aid that *T*-1 is going to the countries that *T*-2 really have no use for us . E_S 
113343:84	###SpeakerB10 . ###Right .

E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###I find that *ICH*-1 a total waste and part of the defense budget . E_S ###Uh , * again being just a voter and a taxpayer , you know , working through our congressman , I do n't think 0 there 's too much that I 'm going *-1 to be able *-2 to do *T*-3 about it , E_S 
113359:68	###and the , um , regular normal taxpayers are , you know paying such a large proportion \[ of , \+ of \] our personal income E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###and then the , uh , corporate , you know , industries just do n't seem *-1 to not pay proportionally . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Right .

113382:34	###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###I mean this nonsense that *T*-1 's coming through now about , uh , uh , * lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has *T*-2 in mind in order \[ t- , \+ to \] * boost the economy because people have \[ n- , \+ \] more money as \[ it 's , \+ \[ gets , \+ \] it 's \] ridiculous . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###If they do n't have that money now , * bringing in less is not going * to help the problem as far as the government . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###\[ Not , \+ not \] going * to help . E_S 
113411:16	###but I guess 0 it 's sitting around so long that it 's sort of like our mortgages .

E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Is n't , N_S ###that 's the way 0 they 're thinking these days anyway *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###It \[ seems , \+ seems \] *-1 to be *?* .

113422:20	###I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 it ever will *?* really .

E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Really . E_S 
113433:33	###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] believe in *-1 paying my share , E_S ###and I do n't mind , uh , *-2 paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to *T*-1 .

N_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Well , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] quite possible . E_S 
113499:4	###SpeakerB4 . ###I am very much for capital punishment . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , wonderful . E_S ###I am *?* too , one hundred percent . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###My Dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
113533:21	###but Texas 's I do n't know are , N_S ###I do n't know E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] no one 's f- , E_S ###I mean it 's not the judge 's fault I do n't think 0 *T*-1 .

E_S ###Man \[ our cr- , \+ our , uh , prisons are so crowded \] that , uh , they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set *-1 free within a year to two .

E_S 
113545:16	###same thing . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###And finally our governor at the time \[ which \+ who \] *T*-1 is not in office now came in and said , okay , where we draw the line *T*-2 is no sex offenders will be let *-3 loose .

113623:18	###But , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Well , part of that is the overcrowding of the court system . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Yea- , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###It is overcrowded because there 's so much \[ drug , \+ uh , problem with the people on drugs \] E_S ###because that ha- , N_S ###\[ they , \+ with the drugs \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] \] robbing and killing E_S ###and , uh , that 's why it 's filled the prisons up so much *T*-2 I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S 
113633:21	###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh , \[ it does n't , \+ it does n't \] help them any at all E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###No , E_S ###it does n't . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###and , of course , your court system when you get into the appeals *T*-1 , N_S ###I do n't believe 0 criminal is in a court by itself .

113704:50	###SpeakerA9 . ###No , E_S ###I do n't think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \[ necessa- , \+ n- , \] N_S ###I think of that . N_S ###\[ It , \+ it \] could n't be . E_S ###Military service is not that much E_S ###but , the , \[ m- , \+ military \] used *-1 to do it E_S ###but the idea that , uh , there are things \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 do need *-3 to be done *-4 that *T*-1 could be done *-5 N_S ###and then , uh , country would benefit from one year \[ from , \+ from \] everybody and even out \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , requirement .

113745:51	###SpeakerB24 . ###There 's lots and lots of volunteer programs E_S ###\[ and , uh , \+ but \] \[ most of those are \+ at \[ l- , \+ least \] \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-3 's \] my opinion that most of those \] involve adults .

113794:42	###I do volunteer work for the American Lung Association . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###And I \[ have , \+ have \] \[ done , \+ uh , gone \] *-1 to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society .

113809:30	###SpeakerA51 . ###Well , that could be . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself , you 're just kind of down the tube , you know .

114413:36	###and those who *T*-1 do n't want it , do n't have *-2 to have it . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Right .

114443:21	###I have kids E_S ###and , you know , that 's just kind of part of it E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###Yeah .

120636:23	###but I keep *-1 putting off *-2 learning . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Hey , you 've got the right idea . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###That 's right . E_S ###But I had recently gone out and planted mums . E_S ###We had decided *-1 to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago , E_S ###and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway 's E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
120674:48	###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###And the next spring , I guess 0 *T*-3 in that March , every time 0 we would go out and just try *-1 to walk on the grass or reach down *-2 to pull a weed *T*-4 , we 'd have big whole patches come up . E_S ###Have you ever seen it what grub worms do *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S 
120679:20	###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by *-1 raking it , E_S ###it would just come off in the rake , down to the dirt . E_S ###So we had *-1 to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything . E_S ###It took a lot of money and a lot of time , E_S 
120693:36	###SpeakerA33 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###we found them E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###yeah E_S ###we found them . E_S ###We dug under there about an inch E_S ###and you could see them . E_S 
120711:36	###SpeakerA39 . ###yeah , E_S ###\[ but in , \+ but in \] the , N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###and some people call them May beetles . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah , E_S 
120722:13	###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###so any how , occasionally I find them in the flower beds . E_S ###They said that every yard has some E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###but it was a preponderance of them that *T*-1 caused our problem . E_S ###So that 's the number one thing 0 we do *T*-1 , whether we fertilize or anything else , just because we got burned *-2 so badly before . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
120740:10	###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I 'm still \+ I 'm still \] replacing that in the back , especially , under the trees ###uh , you know , kind of slow , and , as you say , very expensive . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah , E_S 
120759:62	###and , uh I bought about twenty of them . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###I guess 0 you did too . E_S ###It 's what they 've done *T*-1 in the spring or the fall . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh , well , I put , you know N_S ###SpeakerA63 . 
120766:11	###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh , well , I put , you know N_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###that was late , E_S ###that was like , N_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yeah , E_S ###because I started *-1 to say , 0 \[ you can , \+ \] there 's different times 0 they say 0 it 's okay * to do it *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . 
120822:136	###and we did n't know the difference . E_S ###And every year we learn one more thing *ICH*-2 that we did n't know *T*-1 before . Like about these mums . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah .

120876:4	###SpeakerB102 . ###Well , I had , uh , tomatoes \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , uh , peppers , E_S ###and \[ I had , \+ I had \] okra , E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###That is amazing .

120883:39	###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###they kind of came out *-1 looking like gourds . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Well , * put them in a salad , though , E_S ###and you say , well , I made it though , ###at least it 's mine . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###But I had squash , E_S

123916:56	###and , um , * seems like a people \[ just do n't , \+ or also do n't \] have any family around .

124005:50	###SpeakerB4 . ###Yes , E_S ###I agree .

124028:19	###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I know 0 \[ just , \+ uh , just \] with me , ten years ago , I was comparing the , N_S ###I think 0 \[ I , \+ I \] was living better *ICH*-1 ten years ago than I am *?* now , even though I 'm making more money now , E_S ###but my dollar went a lot farther .

124053:16	###Around here Minnesota , Wisconsin area \[ it 's , \+ uh , it 's \] dropping , E_S ###but I think 0 it 's about a dollar fifteen on an average .

E_S ###Well \[ that 's , \+ uh , that 's \] unu- , N_S ###most of the people 0 I talk to *T*-1 are Texas , E_S 
124167:15	###SpeakerB62 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I did n't really care for them either . E_S ###But now I , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , what 's your favorite baseball team *T*-1 , Rita ?

E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh , uh , you know , I would like *-1 to say the Rangers , E_S ###but unfortunately they 're not *?* . E_S ###I was from Illinois , E_S 
124200:4	###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah E_S ###they did pretty well . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###What did you think *T*-1 of the World Series ? E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Well , I 'll tell you . E_S ###I just , uh , moved down from South Dakota in July , E_S 
124207:4	###SpeakerA15 . ###Well , I 'll tell you . E_S ###I just , uh , moved down from South Dakota in July , E_S ###and , uh , in South Dakota , the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where I was living *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###and so everybody was a Twins fan , E_S ###and I \[ was kind of , \+ \] uh , did n't have much interest in the Twins , you know , E_S ###\[ it was , \+ it was \] kind of pathetic 
124211:49	###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
124233:96	###and we used *-1 to tease \[ about , \+ \] ###my son E_S and I used *-1 to have a bet *ICH*-3 going about some of the players that *T*-2 had moved from here to Minnesota , E_S ###but \[ it was int- , \+ it certainly was \] an exciting Series , anyway . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###It sure was *?* , E_S ###it sure was *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###What do you think 0 *T*-1 going *-2 to happen to the Rangers ?

124241:4	###SpeakerA27 . ###Well , \[ I \+ I \] would like *-1 to \[ \[ a- , \+ a- , \] \+ assume \] that they 're going *-2 to \[ do , \+ do \] better this coming year , E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Or can we predict ? E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###I was sure hopeful anyway . E_S ###When we moved down *T*-1 , uh , I was able *-2 to go to my first , you know baseball game , and thought , this is great , ###this is incredible . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
124248:5	###this is incredible . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###So I became a Rangers fan . E_S ###I did n't really have one in South Dakota . E_S ###So I adopted the Rangers , E_S ###or rather they adopted me , I guess 0 *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
124264:7	###SpeakerB34 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###and it *EXP*-1 's so much more exciting * watching a ball come at you , E_S ###and . N_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh , is n't it *?* though . E_S ###You know , but , oh , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 * going to the ball park just really makes it . Because then you watch it on T V you feel like you 're more a part of it too . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###That 's right , E_S 
124290:17	###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###He 'll be at least one more , E_S ###and he said 0 he 's been saying one more , and it 's been two and three , might be two and three more . E_S ###He likes it . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###That 's right E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah . E_S 
124314:6	###SpeakerA53 . ###Management . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###SpeakerA55 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###But , \[ he 's , \+ uh , he \] certainly is a good example , uh , for the kids . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . 
124325:75	###SpeakerA59 . ###You know , some of the , N_S ###like , uh , Ivan Rodriguez was n't even born *-1 \[ when , \+ when , \] uh , Nolan Ryan started *-2 pitching *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###And it *EXP*-1 's just incredible * to think that \[ there 's , \+ uh , there are \] players who *T*-2 are the sons of ball players that *T*-3 used *-4 to play against Nolan or with Nolan , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . 
124328:46	###SpeakerB60 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###And it *EXP*-1 's just incredible * to think that \[ there 's , \+ uh , there are \] players who *T*-2 are the sons of ball players that *T*-3 used *-4 to play against Nolan or with Nolan , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###and now their sons are *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Oh , he 's been a legend for so many years , you know , E_S 
124332:70	###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###and now their sons are *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Oh , he 's been a legend for so many years , you know , E_S ###and I do n't know , E_S ###\[ were you here , \+ had you moved here \] yet when he did the exhibition at U T with his son *T*-1 . E_S ###His son pitched for U T E_S ###and he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers . E_S 
124340:40	###His son pitched for U T E_S ###and he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###I was n't *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it was a , N_S ###I think 0 it was a little early part of the summer , E_S ###and uh , Nolan against . N_S 
124368:45	###SpeakerA75 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###but Nolan I think 0 *T*-2 took himself out after a couple of innings *ICH*-1 or something , you know , of the game E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###So what do you , uh , think 0 *T*-1 is \[ the , \+ uh , the \] worst culprit for air pollution ? E_S ###SpeakerB3 . 
124377:7	###SpeakerB3 . ###Well , I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] probably a combination of things . E_S ###Um , factories \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 burn coal as \[ a , \+ an \] energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants , you know , E_S ###and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Uh , those are the ones 0 I think 0 *T*-1 primarily contribute to acid rain , E_S ###and I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] probably hurting us a little bit .

124387:102	###So we 're not the lone ranger here . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ I , \+ uh , I , \] N_S ###it *EXP*-1 's hard * to put the finger on , uh , what *T*-2 's worse , \[ you \+ know , \] the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion , um , with , uh , your hydrocarbons , uh causing the damage in which , N_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###SpeakerB9 . ###Hopefully we 're backing off from that a little bit , E_S 
124392:43	###SpeakerB7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###SpeakerB9 . ###Hopefully we 're backing off from that a little bit , E_S ###but I know 0 we have n't cured it yet by a long shot . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Well , I notice 0 on one of these , uh , home shopping networks they were selling these , uh , halogen , uh , fire extinguishers E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Yeah . E_S 
124418:29	###SpeakerA16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###kind of hard * to do anything about that , I guess *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###I know , E_S ###uh , in the Twin Cities area , N_S ###I just moved out of there and was kind of happy 0 I timed it just right , E_S ###but they had a new policy where in order * to get \[ your , \+ uh , your \] \[ license , \+ uh , your car license , \] uh , renewed *-1 , you had *-2 to meet the pollution standards *T*-3 E_S ###SpeakerB19 . 
124427:21	###SpeakerB19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###and , uh . N_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###We have that here , too , E_S ###but it 's part of the inspection sticker , you know , E_S ###they put a probe in your exhaust pipe E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] the computer reads whatever the ionization *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 coming out , E_S ###and so \[ that 's , \+ you know , that 's \] the way 0 they 're dealing with it here *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###SpeakerA24 . ###Yeah , uh , E_S ###yeah E_S ###I guess 0 that was just mainly in the cities there , E_S ###and as far as where I live *T*-1 , I do n't have *-2 to do that , E_S ###but I have an old car which I doubt 0 *T*-1 \[ would , \+ uh , would , \] uh , pass the inspection , a seventy-six , E_S

124552:6	###SpeakerA7 . ###I ju- , N_S ###in what major or what year ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah , E_S ###major . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###International business . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Oh , really . E_S 
124575:6	###SpeakerB16 . ###Forever . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###* Seems like *?* , anyways . N_S ###It 's about five years , E_S ###but it 's probably going *-1 to take me longer , because I did n't decide *-2 to major in that until , uh , about a year and a half after I was already in school , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###You know , I read a study once , E_S 
124609:7	###SpeakerA29 . ###My advice \[ is \+ is , \] uh , * look \[ for , \+ at \] the student to faculty ratio , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###if you 're going *-1 to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one *T*-3 , I do n't think 0 you 're going *-2 to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you 're down to the thirty to forty to one . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Is that , what was yours more like *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah E_S 
124614:37	###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Is that , what was yours more like *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Was there a , N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###it was about twenty-six to one . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
124617:13	###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Was there a , N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###it was about twenty-six to one . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S 
124631:4	###\[ it , \+ it 's \] interesting , E_S ###but \[ it , \+ it 's \] N_S ###what I thought 0 *T*-1 was nice is 0 \[ you could al- , \+ there was always \] time 0 * to talk to professor , you know *T*-2 , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] they knew you . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###You were n't just in their class , you know , E_S ###and so \[ you could , \+ you could \] go *-1 talk to them in their office almost at any time , E_S ###\[ and , \+ or \] if you ran into them in the student union or whatever , you know , you could sit down , talk to them about a problem . E_S 
124634:5	###\[ and , \+ and \] they knew you . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###You were n't just in their class , you know , E_S ###and so \[ you could , \+ you could \] go *-1 talk to them in their office almost at any time , E_S ###\[ and , \+ or \] if you ran into them in the student union or whatever , you know , you could sit down , talk to them about a problem . E_S ###They 're always willing *-1 to help you out . E_S ###\[ So , \+ but \] \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I 's , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] put that against , uh , my high school where we had , uh , a biology class of three hundred and fifty students *T*-1 E_S ###and . N_S 
124643:97	###and . N_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Wow , in high school ? E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###it was a biology lecture class E_S ###SpeakerB46 . 
124701:9	###SpeakerB60 . ###Oh , man . ###I think 0 your advice is good . E_S ###Um * let 's see . ###My advice would be * to pick a major before you get into college E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###That 's excellent advice . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###because \[ I , \+ I \] did n't , E_S ###and I took tons of classes that I did n't need *-2 to *?* *T*-1 , E_S 
124720:30	###SpeakerB64 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###You know , \[ I , \+ I \] mean , I was taking summer classes E_S ###and MUMBLEx * let me get out of here . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###But , uh , no , E_S ###that 's good advice . E_S 
124731:51	###so you do n't want management , E_S ###but you think 0 you want business , E_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###So how many , um , credit cards do you have *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Um , I think 0 I 'm down to one . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Oh , my gosh , E_S ###I wish 0 I was that way . E_S ###Is that why you said 0 I had more experience than you *T*-1 ? E_S 
124735:8	###SpeakerA2 . ###Um , I think 0 I 'm down to one . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Oh , my gosh , E_S ###I wish 0 I was that way . E_S ###Is that why you said 0 I had more experience than you *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Well , no . E_S ###I was pulling your leg . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . 
124741:10	###SpeakerA4 . ###Well , no . E_S ###I was pulling your leg . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Oh . E_S ###Well , \[ how , \+ how \] do you use your credit card *T*-1 ? E_S ###I mean , do you just keep it in reserve , E_S ###or . N_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###\[ I , \+ I , \] 
124747:21	###I mean , do you just keep it in reserve , E_S ###or . N_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###\[ I , \+ I , \] ###well , N_S ###the way 0 I 'd like *-1 to try and use it *T*-2 is , um , \[ \[ you , \+ you , \] \+ you \] make your purchases \[ at , \+ at \] prime buying time E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###and then you pay that off and do n't use it until , uh , it 's paid *-1 off . E_S 
124764:16	###SpeakerA12 . ###Emergencies come along , E_S ###\[ and I \+ and I \] use it . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###SpeakerB15 . ###that 's understandable , ###exactly . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . 
124813:32	###SpeakerB29 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###so we just disposed of them , paid them off , and got out of it . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###I just . N_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Uh-huh , E_S 
124870:44	###SpeakerA52 . ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###so that I use *T*-1 , because I travel some . E_S ###So I use that , E_S ###and I do n't really have *-1 to worry about that , because I only use it for business , E_S ###so I automatically have the money 0 * to pay it off *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . 
124922:16	###SpeakerB73 . ###Yeah , E_S ###you ca n't say too much about it really . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###Other than , you use them or you do n't use them . E_S You like them E_S or you do n't like them . E_S ###So . N_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###I guess , uh , 0 they do n't care if we end it early . E_S 
124960:5	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I guess Cadillac . E_S ###I guess 0 that 's kind of everybody 's dream . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , why would that be *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh , I guess 0 it 's a General Motors product , E_S ###and I like General Motors because they 're made *-1 in the United States , E_S ###and , uh , we 've had General Motors for years and have always had real good luck with them . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
124965:9	###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh , I guess 0 it 's a General Motors product , E_S ###and I like General Motors because they 're made *-1 in the United States , E_S ###and , uh , we 've had General Motors for years and have always had real good luck with them .

124976:67	###SpeakerB8 . ###Oh , um , I think 0 I 'd still go with the Cadillac . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Do you ?

124984:5	###SpeakerB12 . ###Oh , I do n't know . E_S ###I guess the Seville , probably or . N_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###The Seville . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###That 's a sharp looking car . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . 
125011:42	###SpeakerB22 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###I thought , now that looks sharp E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###that looks real sharp . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
125085:5	###SpeakerB48 . ###Mostly Oldsmobiles . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Oldsmobiles . E_S ###Those are real nice riding cars too . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Oh , yeah .

125138:51	###SpeakerB68 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###you just do n't want any hassles with it . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###No .

125184:30	###SpeakerB88 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###SpeakerB90 . ###Uh-huh .

125224:11	###if we 're going *-1 to have national health insurance , which *T*-2 seems likely , it 's necessarily going *-3 to involve more taxes .

125232:25	###SpeakerA5 . ###Where 's it all going *T*-1 ?

125333:5	###SpeakerB40 . ###Oh , I did n't know that .

125369:43	###and then my little one , three year old , is in , um , a University of Gymnastics , E_S ###it 's \[ a , \+ a \] preschool E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh .

125401:40	###SpeakerA19 . ###Or staying home .

E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###and we know a lot of people at the church E_S ###so I would feel very confident with *-1 leaving my child there . E_S 
125406:30	###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###and we know a lot of people at the church E_S ###so I would feel very confident with *-1 leaving my child there . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###That 's a very good place 0 * to start *T*-1 I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
125419:13	###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###and , uh , the churches always have I think 0 *T*-1 , \[ a , \+ a \] pretty good program , E_S ###and you have *-1 to make * sure \[ that you , \+ um , that you \] apply pretty early , because \[ they do have , \+ a lot of places have \] very long waiting lists . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###\[ And , \+ um , and \] another question 0 * to ask *T*-1 is if they 're , um , state certified um , you know , if the teachers have , um , their Master 's degree \[ in , \+ in \] child education and um , child development . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
125435:32	###Um , when your child 's a little bit older , like a three year old *T*-3 you 'd be more concerned with if there 's a type of care that it *EXP*-2 's torture for them to lay down and take a nap *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Right . E_S 
125452:73	###SpeakerB40 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Um , you know , it 's kind of scary , I guess 0 *T*-1 , because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately , E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###and so , \[ it 's , \+ I guess 0 it 's \] such a growing concern , E_S 
125466:10	###and sometimes you even consider , um , you know , *-1 having a private person come to your own home when they 're real little *T*-2 \[ or \+ or \] something like that , E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Right .

129207:9	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , \[ I , \+ I \] just last Friday got off a capital murder case . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Oh , you did ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I was on the jury . Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . 
129221:4	###SpeakerA9 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so I am just hitting it right . E_S ###Uh , how do I feel about it *T*-1 ? E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know . E_S ###Well , I guess 0 it is right in certain cases . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
129227:9	###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know . E_S ###Well , I guess 0 it is right in certain cases . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Becau- , N_S ###well , the one 0 I was just on *T*-1 , I do n't , N_S ###I was an alternate on the case , E_S ###so I do n't know what *T*-1 was decided *-2 . E_S 
129237:18	###SpeakerA13 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###They are probably still in deliberations on it . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###But , uh , what I found *T*-1 out , N_S ###\[ once , \+ once \] I was declared *-1 an alternate and I was dismissed *-2 , we met with the judge , ###the two alternates did . E_S 
129251:36	###and I remember *-1 hearing about it . E_S ###It was about a year ago . E_S ###Uh , \[ he was , \+ he was \] involved *-1 in \[ another one , \+ another \] capital murder the very next month E_S ###and he was caught *-1 just , N_S ###\[ they , \+ they \] drove up , E_S ###the police drove up just as he fired the \[ g- , \+ gun \] and killed the guy . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Oh , wow . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###So he was caught *-1 E_S 
129292:45	###SpeakerA33 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###He just , ###well , N_S from what I can tell *T*-1 . ###I mean , I did n't talk to the guy or anything , E_S ###but I mean , he does n't seem *-1 to have any regard for \[ anythi- , \+ \] anybody 's life including his own . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
129297:15	###I mean , I did n't talk to the guy or anything , E_S ###but I mean , he does n't seem *-1 to have any regard for \[ anythi- , \+ \] anybody 's life including his own . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###So , \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] kind of strange that , you know , N_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
129314:54	###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , it 's funny because when , you know , they interview you before you go on the jury \[ and \+ \] for capital murder *T*-1 , ###I was interviewed *-2 by four attorneys for about five hours . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . 
129334:25	###and I said I ca n't imagine , E_S ###I said 0 if I knew beyond a doubt *RNR*-1 or if I felt beyond a doubt *RNR*-1 that he had done it , yeah , E_S I guess 0 I could convict him , E_S ###but I ca n't imagine you ever making me that sure of something . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###But they really did . E_S ###\[ It was , \+ it was \] really amazing . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Really ? E_S 
129368:38	###SpeakerB66 . ###Well , \[ they ca n't , \+ they can , \] I think 0 *T*-2 in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because \[ he has n't been , \+ he has n't been \] found *-1 guilty of it . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###Of that crime E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . 
129405:29	###SpeakerA81 . ###Okay . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###So there is a lot of outs , E_S ###but the only result is , 0 otherwise he gets life in prison . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and I 'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . 
129435:6	###I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Personally I do n't know which I would pick *T*-1 if I had a choice for myself . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###That 's true . E_S ###I mean , I do n't know whether I 'd stay in prison or not E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB96 . 
129440:19	###SpeakerA95 . ###That 's true . E_S ###I mean , I do n't know whether I 'd stay in prison or not E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so , you said 0 you 're from Mississippi ? E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Yes , ma'am . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . 
129512:49	###SpeakerA6 . ###Um , * let 's see , E_S ###uh , I like seafood . E_S ###Uh , * let 's see , E_S ###uh , shrimp , ###steamed \[ she- , \+ uh , shellfish \] with maybe herbs . E_S ###Uh , spicy lobster with \[ lem- , \+ linguini . \] E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###That sounds good . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . 
129525:28	###SpeakerA10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###And what would that be like *T*-1 , ###a clam or , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . 
129529:6	###a clam or , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh , I think 0 hors d'oeuvres are good , too . E_S ###Uh , and that way , you can have a variety . Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB15 . 
129540:79	###SpeakerA16 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or , N_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Yeah , E_S ###fresh vegetables would be good E_S ###or , uh , just , N_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Probably not nachos and dip , huh ? E_S 
129554:100	###SpeakerA22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Okay . E_S ###And then when you serve the meal *T*-1 , what type of wine would you have *T*-2 \[ \[ with , \+ uh , with the , \] \+ with \] seafood ? E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###Oh , all these hard questions . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###SpeakerA26 . 
129560:10	###SpeakerA24 . ###Oh , all these hard questions . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###SpeakerA26 . ###Uh , what , white wine ? E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###That would be my guess . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . 
129560:31	###SpeakerA24 . ###Oh , all these hard questions . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###SpeakerA26 . ###Uh , what , white wine ? E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###That would be my guess . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . 
129587:8	###SpeakerA36 . ###Oh , you do ? E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###So , we might have some cocktails *ICH*-1 ahead of time and maybe \[ some , \+ uh , some \] dip , uh , some cheese . E_S ###One of our favorites is , uh , * to take some , * let 's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think , is that what *T*-1 comes in those little blocks ? And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and , uh , wash them and cool them and then dump them in the , uh , sauce and then take crackers E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###SpeakerA40 . ###Yeah . E_S 
129606:28	###Cake sometimes , E_S ###but , uh , that 's what we would do *T*-1 for a dinner party , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###That sounds good , too . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###But \[ \[ that 's , \+ I guess 0 when you talk about dinner party *T*-2 , that 's probably not , \] \+ uh , that 's more for like \] when friends come over *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###Traditional E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###SpeakerA48 . 
129608:21	###SpeakerA44 . ###That sounds good , too . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###But \[ \[ that 's , \+ I guess 0 when you talk about dinner party *T*-2 , that 's probably not , \] \+ uh , that 's more for like \] when friends come over *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###Traditional E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###SpeakerA48 . ###right ? E_S ###SpeakerB49 . 
129612:36	###SpeakerA46 . ###Traditional E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###SpeakerA48 . ###right ? E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Traditional , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Yeah . E_S 
129612:104	###SpeakerA46 . ###Traditional E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###SpeakerA48 . ###right ? E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Traditional , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Yeah . E_S 
129637:55	###SpeakerA58 . ###Um , my father owns a restaurant . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###Oh , \[ in , \+ uh , Is it in \] Dallas ? E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] just \[ a , uh , c- , \+ a cafe , \] E_S ###so it 's not really anything *ICH*-1 , you know , that I want *-2 to , N_S ###it 's not the same . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###SpeakerA62 . 
129691:37	###SpeakerB2 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , lots , right ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Finally . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Really , E_S 
129702:16	###SpeakerA7 . ###Well , we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the , uh , Boy Scouts 0 our boys have been involved *-2 in *T*-1 have , uh , had a huge recycling bin , over at Resurrection Lutheran Church E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
129716:26	###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###so the Boy Scout troop quit *-1 doing it when the City took it over *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###So now we just put ours out for the City of Plano . E_S ###Do you live in Plano ? E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
129720:29	###SpeakerB16 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###So now we just put ours out for the City of Plano . E_S ###Do you live in Plano ? E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yes , E_S ###I do . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Okay , E_S 
129734:18	###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Have you had yours now ? E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Although \[ just , \+ just \] about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that , uh , *T*-1 work in the library for me said 0 they had n't gotten theirs . E_S 
129746:16	###I guess 0 \[ it \+ you know , it \] does go in cycles , E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###and not everyone got theirs right away . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And \[ I , \+ I \] was so relieved because I 've been making a real concerted effort , *-1 \[ make , \+ \] you know , recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it . E_S 
129841:25	###what are some of the things 0 they do n't recycle *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S ###Oh , one thing 0 I thought about *T*-1 the other day were batteries , E_S ###just everyday regular batteries . Supposedly , you know , leak \[ and , \+ and \] contaminate the landfills E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###and , yet , what am I going *-1 to do *T*-4 when I have a couple double A batteries 0 * to toss *T*-2 out *T*-3 . E_S 
129842:4	###Oh , one thing 0 I thought about *T*-1 the other day were batteries , E_S ###just everyday regular batteries .

129851:13	###SpeakerA75 . ###Yeah , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###And they do n't take , N_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###* Probably going *-1 to throw them in your trash . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's what *T*-1 happens E_S 
129851:39	###SpeakerA75 . ###Yeah , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###And they do n't take , N_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###* Probably going *-1 to throw them in your trash . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's what *T*-1 happens E_S 
129861:11	###because , N_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Well , there are places that *T*-1 take car batteries , E_S ###but I wonder if they would take , N_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###I mean , not that it would , N_S ###kind of a pain * to , you know , drive over somewhere special \[ just for that , \+ for two \] little tiny batteries E_S ###but , N_S 
129887:10	###SpeakerB88 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###and one thing 0 I thought 0 *T*-1 was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he , uh , scanned *T*-2 across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###SpeakerB92 . ###Oh , is that right ? E_S ###SpeakerA93 . 
129899:31	###SpeakerB94 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###but , uh N_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###* Registering our garbage . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###they must be trying *-1 to keep track of , you know , who *T*-2 is doing it , or what , I guess 0 *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Yeah . E_S 
129907:47	###SpeakerB98 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###Another , N_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Would n't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Ooh , for those who *T*-1 are really cooperating . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . 
129916:17	###SpeakerB102 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Now , that would encourage it . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Well , except I know 0 it would just not be cost effective .

E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm \] not really certain how I , \+ uh , I 'm not certain \[ that , \+ that \] it \] does a lot of good .

129977:9	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm \] not really certain how I , \+ uh , I 'm not certain \[ that , \+ that \] it \] does a lot of good .

130012:28	###SpeakerA11 . ###Right .

E_S ###And also , it does n't seem like it does that many harm , E_S ###I mean , sure , their life is taken *-1 , E_S ###but they 'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway , E_S 
130028:85	###SpeakerB16 . ###some people , N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###Except that , I mean , \[ the , \+ the \] average cost \[ to si- , \+ to society \] of * having somebody in jail for all their life \[ is , \+ is \] extremely high .

130654:14	###\[ We , \+ they \] recycle , N_S ###they have bins E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and , uh , plastic bottles *T*-1 E_S ###and I think 0 that 's all 0 they have *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . 
130660:20	###and I think 0 that 's all 0 they have *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###What about you guys ? E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Well , we , uh , N_S ###there is a lot of things that you can recycle *T*-1 down here , although the only thing 0 I guess 0 I wind up *-3 recycling *T*-2 religiously is , uh , aluminum cans . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
130688:14	###SpeakerA16 . ###Oh , \[ can you , \+ can you \] hold on for just a minute ? E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Sure .

130711:10	###SpeakerB25 . ###Uh , no , E_S ###you probably get charged *-1 like a nickel or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###SpeakerA28 . ###Exactly E_S ###and so it 's like they charge you for the deposit , E_S ###so when you turn in the cans unsmashed *T*-1 , you 're just , like , reimbursed *-2 . E_S 
130721:7	###SpeakerB29 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Type of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Okay , E_S ###no , E_S ###they do n't charge us that extra nickel . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###That 's sort of nice , though . E_S 
130735:8	###SpeakerA34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###So when we get like , uh , uh , a twelve pack *T*-1 , then that 's like twelve cents back . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so you guys can actually get ahead . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . 
130739:7	###SpeakerA36 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so you guys can actually get ahead . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###But , uh , they have sort of like , uh , things that \[ you c- , \+ you 're not \] like reimbursed for *T*-1 or paid for *T*-1 . E_S ###Like we can recycle , uh , clear glass , brown glass , green glass . Uh , and milk jugs and , uh , newspapers , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Yeah . E_S 
130762:45	###SpeakerB45 . ###Well , shoot , maybe what we ought *-1 to do *T*-2 is *-1 start *-3 sending unsmashed , uh , Pepsi cans and whatever up there . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###SpeakerA48 . ###Exactly , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###* send it to this address , E_S ###no . E_S 
130764:18	###SpeakerA46 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###SpeakerA48 . ###Exactly , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###* send it to this address , E_S ###no . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###SpeakerA50 . 
130779:17	###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's , N_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###In other words , * taking care of the environment \[ is , \+ is \] all well and good E_S ###SpeakerA54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###but if it 's going *-1 to cost you *-2 to take care of the environment , they 're not quite as , uh likely *-3 to do it as \[ if , \+ uh , if \] you get something back for it . You know . E_S 
130837:7	###SpeakerB77 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###And so that 's something that I 've never , N_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###\[ I , \+ \[ we 're , \+ we 're \] \] new to Iowa E_S ###so that 's something that I had n't , you know , looked into *T*-1 before . E_S ###But that 's one way 0 * to sort of get money and still recycle *T*-1 , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S 
130857:26	###SpeakerA3 . ###I 'm in Dallas , Texas . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###What about yourself ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , I 'm also in Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Okay . E_S 
130921:19	###SpeakerB30 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] probably do know , E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh , you , N_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###but I do n't know it by that name . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia , Skillman cross *T*-1 . E_S 
130931:16	###SpeakerA35 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###We 're just north of , uh , White Rock Lake . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Oh , okay , E_S ###yeah , E_S 
130979:40	###SpeakerB54 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###but some of those are pretty big . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yes , E_S ###those are over a million . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah . E_S ###So , \[ it 's , \+ that 's \] the strange thing about , I guess , Dallas because back where I 'm from *T*-1 , you would n't have that sort of a variation at all . E_S 
130989:67	###They 'd all be pretty similar to one another within \[ a , \+ a \] couple miles . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Well , we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Not as bad as Houston , E_S ###but , exactly what you 're describing *T*-1 is what *T*-2 happens all over . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . 
130998:12	###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I 've noticed that . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Well , now , do you live in \[ a , \+ a \] \[ home , \+ or zero lot home , \] E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###or , N_S 
130998:32	###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I 've noticed that . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Well , now , do you live in \[ a , \+ a \] \[ home , \+ or zero lot home , \] E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###or , N_S 
131063:17	###SpeakerA85 . ###SpeakerB86 . ###And we bought it from someone who *T*-1 was in it , E_S ###but before they had it , I found out after I had been in the house , \[ it , \+ it \] had sat * empty for the better part of a year . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###And I 'm not sure what *T*-1 happened , E_S ###but I do know 0 the folks that we bought it from *T*-1 had done virtually no maintenance \[ for , \+ for \] about four years .

131083:4	###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh , I guess 0 the first thing has been \[ the , \+ uh , for the \] right , for women to vote . E_S ###I think 0 that *ICH*-1 has been a major change and also the fact that , uh , there are so \[ mu- , \+ many \] more women *ICH*-2 in the work force nowadays than there were *?* E_S ###and that 's probably going *-1 to increase .

131138:25	###but , you know , women get maternity leave and stuff like that E_S ###and I know that \[ they 've , \+ there \] has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave *-1 to help out , E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###but you know , I have n't really heard much about that recently . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Well , you know , there is a lot of companies that *T*-1 wo n't give \[ mat- , \+ women maternity \] leave for that very reason . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
131162:7	###and that was the reason E_S ###because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men E_S ###\[ but , \+ So , \] uh , N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Huh , that 's interesting . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###That 's a bummer , though . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah E_S 
131182:16	###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###but , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###What do you see , uh , *T*-1 changing in the future ? E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###I think that we 're probably going *-1 to see a lot more companies , uh , run * by females . E_S 
131190:4	###SpeakerB52 . ###I think that we 're probably going *-1 to see a lot more companies , uh , run * by females . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Right , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] top level . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###And we 'll prob- , N_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###I 'm sorry ? E_S 
131263:36	###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###but , uh one of the big changes , uh , 0 they 're doing *T*-1 in Salt Lake is , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###and they 're probably , N_S ###I 'm sure , 0 in Dallas since you 're big places , a lot more women are , uh , working right out of their home with their P C 's or with their lap computers or whatever .

132156:4	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I watched something on T V *ICH*-1 a couple of months ago by , uh , \[ General , \+ ex , uh , Surgeon General \] Koop . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###And he talked about Canada 's system E_S ###and it appears *-1 to work fine for the normal colds and things like that , E_S ###but the expensive stuff , heart , uh , operations and things , they have a managed scarcity .

132169:36	###and there 's probably some truth to that . E_S ###I think that , uh , generally I do n't welcome added government responsibilities .

132185:31	###That 's where I think 0 most of the cost is coming *T*-1 .

133948:5	###You know , they try *-1 to have you form opinions or whatever , E_S ###and then \[ I , \+ I \] did n't like \[ the thi- , \+ the things \] that *T*-1 were going on when we had Desert Storm *T*-2 and stuff like that .

133968:22	###so \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I 'm \] well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking , \[ and , \+ and \] so forth . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###So , communications , huh .

138090:4	###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh , overall on campus about twelve hundred , but in the \[ upper school , \+ upper four grades , \] uh , about four hundred and something E_S ###so it 's maybe a hundred per grade .

138250:26	###so I , N_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 that probably does \[ have , \+ have \] something 0 *T*-1 to do with it , E_S ###and it 's also , N_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###\[ Do , \+ uh , does \] this school 0 your son goes to *T*-1 , do they , uh , \[ re- , \+ require \] * to wear a uniform E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###No , E_S

138272:5	###SpeakerA3 . ###Do you , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , \[ k- , \+ kind \] of , mainly the woodworking 0 I 've done *T*-1 lately is , uh , * made like , uh , for example a little nativity scene . ###Uh , not \[ the , \+ uh , the \] whole figurines and so forth , but mainly the stable , ###* put some shelves in ###\[ and , \+ and \] some odd stuff around the house E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh .

138335:76	###so I designed a space just the right size for the T V and then \[ the , \+ the \] V C R and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###And , uh , that 's worked pretty well . E_S ###Uh , \[ with , \+ uh , with \] the router you can make nice , uh , N_S 
138346:23	###SpeakerA29 . ###Right , E_S ###or yes , E_S ###I , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###I 'm aware of that . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh , And it 's , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###SpeakerB32 . 
138371:7	###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###And \[ I , \+ I \] debate whether it *EXP*-1 's better * to get \[ a , \+ uh , just a \] straight table saw or to get one of these , uh , rotary arm saws . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Radial arm saw is , I guess 0 *T*-3 , what they 're called *-1 *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
138379:33	###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh , it \[ t- , \+ seems to \] me 0 the radial arm saw \[ is , \+ is \] better , E_S ###well , \[ it , \+ it \] takes up less room . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###I mean , \[ you , \+ you \] set the wood down E_S ###and you move the saw . E_S 
138406:22	###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###and , I used *-1 to put all the stuff in my basement , E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###but not so here in Texas . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . 
138449:14	###SpeakerB2 . ###Oh , well , \[ my , \+ my \] feelings on it is , uh , 0 I would n't take a child to day-care . ###You know ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###I mean , \[ I 'd , \+ I 'd \] wind up , uh , N_S just a baby-sitter in a home .

138459:4	###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Just because of the , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , too many kids \[ and , \+ and \] I think *T*-1 too many infections and things coming in . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah , E_S ###they seem *-1 to pass a lot of , N_S ###SpeakerB10 . 
138497:4	###SpeakerA19 . ###Well , I think 0 \[ they had a , \+ they had \] two teachers E_S ###and I think 0 there were twenty kids , E_S ###but I only had her going two days E_S ###and most of the other kids were going more days E_S ###so that was probably my own fault that she did n't , N_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . 
138511:37	###SpeakerB24 . ###Oh , she did ? E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yes , E_S ###and , uh , I was kind of \[ m- , \+ mad \] that they had never noticed that and , either pointed it out to me \[ or , \+ or , \] uh tried *-1 to say , * look , you 're holding your , N_S ###she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff .

138566:124	###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###I think 0 it *EXP*-2 would be hard * to take them to people 0 you do n't know *T*-1 . E_S ###Preschool 's a different thing , E_S ###but I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's hard * to take kids to somebody 0 you do n't know *T*-2 \[ \[ and , \+ or \] \+ \] unless you have awfully good references .

138589:57	###and they usually adapt pretty well . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah .

138605:16	###I think 0 it 's , ###well , N_S I do n't know , E_S ###\[ then , \+ then \] on the other hand I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's harder * to stay home in some regards .

E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###and we ca n't *?* because it 's not accustomed to *-1 being on a leash E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###I mean , it just goes like a mad dog , E_S 
140948:69	###I mean , it just goes like a mad dog , E_S ###I mean it just jumps up and down and starts *-1 yapping , E_S ###and \[ it 's , \+ you know , I mean , it 's \] not even close to * even being trained *-1 on a leash .

140990:4	###SpeakerB78 . ###I think 0 it was like a six week program . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Every , what ?

141023:5	###Is it MUMBLEx ?

141048:27	###Oh , plus we watch a little T V together . E_S ###We really do n't watch , I think 0 *T*-1 , as much T V as a lot of people . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###We do n't have H B O . E_S ###We do get the Disney channel for the kids . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
141059:24	###and my husband sometimes joins them with that . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh , my little girl , Jennifer , likes *-1 to do crafty things , E_S ###and I 'll take some time and do that with her .

E_S ###I 'm , basically the story person because my husband does n't have , N_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
141096:59	###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###but , you know , on school nights , the two older ones get to bed about nine .

141124:16	###I admire , people \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 can do it all , E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###I can imagine . E_S 
141164:7	###SpeakerB52 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ a lot of people , \+ a lot of people \] \[ s- , \+ set \] their kids in front of the T V and H B O and rent movies \[ and , \+ and , \] kind of leave them to their own means . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###I think , you know , 0 it *EXP*-1 's \[ very , \+ very \] easy * to fall into that trap , E_S 
141175:49	###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###But , um , um , I think 0 different parts of the country , N_S ###I think 0 in Plano and maybe this area in Texas , there 's a lot of community activities that parents could join in *T*-1 with their kids . E_S ###People are , real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids , sports activities and , N_S ###SpeakerA61 . 
141210:43	###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###\[ And , \+ um , um , but , \] you know , if you have the type of job , N_S ###I have a friend that *T*-1 's a nurse E_S ###and she can pick her hours E_S ###and N_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB76 .

141282:47	###SpeakerB13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Most everybody is right in that area . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###That makes it a lot easier . E_S A lot more convenient . E_S ###That is why we only do it once every five or ten years *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . 
141289:11	###SpeakerA16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Spec- , N_S ###because it *EXP*-1 is always that hard * to get everyone together . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Yeah .

141303:11	###SpeakerA20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###\[ So , \+ so , \] *-2 to make one successful , I mean , I mean what do you all do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Oh , E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Do you all just start *-1 planning real far ahead of time ? E_S ###SpeakerA24 .

141361:10	###So , we have got , uh , uh , my wife and I have , uh , a bit longer ways 0 * to go *T*-1 than most . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###But , you also manage *-1 to make them .

E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###But we are both in school E_S ###so that makes it kind of tough . E_S 
141406:4	###SpeakerB61 . ###Originally , uh , I , uh , was born *-1 in Missouri . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###But , uh , you know , we have relatives scattered * out all over Louisiana , Mississippi , uh , here in Texas E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###but it *EXP*-1 is harder for everyone to \[ get in , \+ get \] home . E_S 
141421:51	###So it *EXP*-1 is easier for us few stragglers to go home . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###Then the majority of them are still in the Missouri area . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###Okay . E_S ###You know our family right now , uh , the most of it , there is only a few stragglers , uh , with any distance .

141435:14	###Do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend 0 we are going *-1 to do it *T*-2 , E_S ###or do you all like mail out stuff ?

E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Well , it is like , \[ wel- , \+ \] the one that I worked in *T*-1 , uh , you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day , E_S ###they would just roll themselves around all over the place E_S ###\[ and \+ and \] they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yes . E_S 
146629:16	###SpeakerB64 . ###Yes , E_S ###Alzheimer , E_S ###yes .

146635:81	###SpeakerB66 . ###Yes E_S ###and that can , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay , E_S ###so now what are your opinions on recycling *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Well , I definitely think that we need *-1 to start *-2 recycling . E_S ###I think 0 it has got *-1 to be an individual responsibility until , N_S ###I think 0 if we wait *ICH*-3 , uh , which *T*-1 is happening until somebody says 0 we have *-2 to do it it is going *-4 to be to late . E_S 
146641:10	###SpeakerA2 . ###Well , I definitely think that we need *-1 to start *-2 recycling .

146655:18	###It *EXP*-1 is very difficult here even if you care like I do * to do much . E_S ###I take , my paper , E_S ###I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###and I can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them E_S ###and there are some fire stations 0 I can take newspapers to *T*-1 E_S ###and that is very inconvenient cause I have *-1 to wait until I have enough of them * to make the trip worthwhile . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . 
146672:16	###but they would n't take them . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Yeah . E_S ###It *EXP*-1 is real hard * to find a spot E_S ###and then , I do n't know if you note , 0 even * doing that , the amount of trash 0 we throw *T*-1 away is incredible E_S ###bottles E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Oh I know . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###glass E_S 
146689:65	###SpeakerB17 . ###I think 0 that is a good idea . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###And I think 0 that is what it is going *-1 to have *-2 to come to *T*-3 . Where we are just forced *-4 to *T*-5 .

146712:50	###SpeakerB27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###I mean , I am willing *-1 to do it E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###Plus you have *-1 to have a place 0 *-2 to store all of it *T*-3 E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . 
146735:38	###SpeakerB35 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###and then you take it back to the store E_S ###and you get it back . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Uh , so that way it kind of forces you to recycle . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###You are forced *-1 to *?* . E_S ###And , uh , you also do n't see the litter there . E_S 
146814:18	###SpeakerB65 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###you add wa- , N_S ###well , I image 0 everybody else will start *-1 doing that sooner or later , E_S ###but I am going *-1 to stick with Downey because they were first .

146831:10	###SpeakerA70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###And I think that it 's just 0 people have got *-1 to be aware .

147100:51	###SpeakerB3 . ###\[ I , \+ you know , I \] assume , that the major sources are cars and factories . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###SpeakerB5 . ###SpeakerA6 . ###That 's what , I would think *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###But \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know for sure . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###SpeakerB9 .

147118:31	###I know 0 we have a lot of chemical , the indoor type pollution . E_S ###They have offices that *T*-1 are too well insulated *-2 .

E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###Um , I guess 0 there 's been a lot of pressure * to , um , do away with the C F C 's in these spray bottles which , *T*-1 has been a real problem . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Right . E_S 
147134:86	###SpeakerA16 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###SpeakerA18 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that is , \+ well that 's \] destroying the ozone , is n't it *?* ?

147159:118	###SpeakerB27 . ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I 'm \] wondering whether it 's going *-1 to get to the point where you ca n't , do that *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###I think 0 it will *?* .

147723:14	###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Well , I suspect that it is possible .

E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###But , uh , other than that I think 0 maybe it just depends on how you define honesty *T*-1 . E_S 
147728:54	###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###That 's a good point . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###But , uh , other than that I think 0 maybe it just depends on how you define honesty *T*-1 .

E_S ###But I think 0 maybe a lot of them , um , N_S ###say the more honest ones who *T*-2 are still looking out for themselves , it may be more matter of not what can I steal *T*-1 while in an office but how many friends can I make *T*-3 while , I 'm in office .

147760:19	###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And , you know , how good a name can I make *T*-1 for myself and so forth . E_S ###So I guess 0 it would be like anything else . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S

147794:14	###SpeakerA27 . ###That 's a problem , is n't it *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah .

147826:36	###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and it almost seems like in order *-1 to avoid , uh , some of the scandal , you would have *-1 to have the kind of wife that you would only find *T*-2 , \[ on , \+ say in \] the Bobsy twins or , something like that .

147909:14	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I have *-1 to say 0 my favorite type of music would probably be , uh , classical music . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Oh , same here . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh , really .

147939:143	###SpeakerA15 . ###Well , one thing that *T*-1 's helped us a lot is that , uh , \[ you , \+ you know , you \] can buy a lot of these operas now on \[ video casse- , \+ uh , video tape \] E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###and so we have quite a collection of those , E_S ###and you watch them at home , E_S ###and they have subtitles , E_S ###so \[ you , \+ you \] figure out what *T*-1 's going on after a while , E_S ###and then you can enjoy it in the , uh , theater .

147995:16	###SpeakerB38 . ###One is thirteen ###and one is eleven . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###So they 're doing this in school , or what ? E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 .

148072:34	###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###and they will , uh , record the music at that time .

149087:50	###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's what I learned a lot of languages on *T*-1 , was an Apple two E in my high school .

E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###so you have eight children . E_S ###Um , what type of things do you do *T*-1 as a family *-3 to spend time together . E_S 
149229:10	###SpeakerB2 . ###Oh , we spend a lot of time outdoors *-1 jogging , bicycling , uh , going to the park , um , some time *-1 watching V C R movies um , ###generally cheap things . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . 
149242:11	###Uh , with lots of kids you do n't have lots of money for recreation . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Well , that 's fun .

149252:35	###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###and that is so fun . E_S ###The kids just get a crack out of that .

E_S ###Have you taken a lot of vacations together E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
149274:12	###SpeakerB18 . ###In Arizona . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Oh , so that 's a bit of a drive for you there . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Oh , so you like *-1 to go there for the holidays E_S ###and . N_S ###SpeakerB22 . 
149292:9	###SpeakerB26 . ###They range from twenty-four to five . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###So you have some in the nest and some out , huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###How old are your children *T*-1 ? E_S 
149302:4	###SpeakerA31 . ###We have , N_S ###ours start at twelve E_S ###and then they go down to four .

E_S ###SpeakerB34 . 
149322:21	###and . N_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yes , E_S ###and then if you want *-1 to play something on the little kids ' level , then the older kids get real bored , E_S ###and they want *-1 to do something else . E_S ###So . N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah , E_S 
149365:40	###SpeakerA55 . ###Oh , good . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###I think 0 it 's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh .

149369:33	###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###and I think 0 more people are interested in * spending time with their kids now . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###I think so , E_S ###and I feel \[ like , \+ you know , like \] President \[ Bush , \+ Bush \] has mentioned quite often , that we are trying *-1 to become a kinder and gentler nation , E_S ###and it does begin with the families at home E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah . E_S 
149383:40	###So . N_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yes , E_S ###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] true . E_S ###Well , we see that a lot out here in Utah , E_S ###and , um , \[ hopefully , \+ hopefully \] it 's going *-1 to spread , huh . MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Utah 's a lot better than Texas . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Oh . E_S 
149383:62	###So . N_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yes , E_S ###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] true .

149587:67	###SpeakerA51 . ###Yes , E_S ###uh-huh , E_S ###we 're in a house , E_S ###but we 're in a subdivision where we really ca n't allow the dog *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###I see .

149592:22	###SpeakerB52 . ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###we could n't allow him to run free , E_S ###so , he was just chained *-1 up all the time , E_S ###and \[ it was , \+ it was \] unfortunate . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###So have you tried any other pets ? E_S 
149623:7	###SpeakerA65 . ###Oh , my word . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###uh , . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And do \[ they , \+ they \] just paper train it or something ? E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###I guess . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 .

149727:84	###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . 
149733:90	###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . ###Right , E_S ###and , uh , well , as you said , mostly they are token cuts . E_S ###Uh especially what , for instance , George Bush is offering *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
149740:11	###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###The ninety-seven cents a week . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah , E_S ###ninety-seven cents a week .

150331:32	###so , each assembly process has an inspection right after it 's done *-1 , E_S ###and then we do electrical tests on them during the process , E_S ###so .

E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
151268:27	###SpeakerA41 . ###Huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###So the whole thing had *-1 to be tried *-2 over again . E_S 
151302:10	###Was it a six or twelve member jury ? E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh , it must have been six . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah .

151737:8	###\[ and \+ and \] it 's all of like , ###\[ she , \+ she \] comes from a big family . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###She has like seven sisters I think 0 *T*-1 .

151761:9	###SpeakerB25 . ###Um , \[ the , \+ probably the \] biggest challenge was * getting a place where everyone , you know , could eat comfortably \[ and , \+ and \] everything *T*-1 , uh . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###I guess 0 probably the most helpful thing was that , um , for the rent , we rented like \[ a , \+ a \] rescue squad building or something like that .

151763:51	###SpeakerA26 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###SpeakerA30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . 
151806:7	###SpeakerB45 . ###Uh , she 's eighty-six . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###Oh , goodness . E_S ###\[ Is she pretty spry , \+ ###is she , you know , pretty . \] E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###Now she does , N_S ###she looks probably like she 's in her early sixties E_S ###SpeakerA48 . 
151830:11	###SpeakerA54 . ###Really . E_S ###Well that sounds fun . E_S ###Well , \[ I \+ I \] had a real challenge of * planning a family reunion a few years ago , E_S ###and there were , N_S ###we sent out five hundred , uh , announcements , because our family is quite large , like \[ your , \+ your \] family there .

E_S 
151957:10	###and then do , you know , that number , ###\[ and then \+ \] how many \[ a , \+ a \] freezer separate from ###and how many people , especially here in Texas , *T*-2 own cars and trucks with air conditioning .

151960:8	###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###I mean , \[ this is , \+ \[ there , \+ there \] are \] people \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 \[ make it , \+ have \] a thriving business , uh , that *T*-1 do nothing but heating and air conditioning \[ on , \+ on \] automobiles and trucks , E_S ###and , uh , the only reason 0 I did n't , uh , get into that more , when I \[ was , \+ had \] my little business *T*-1 *T*-2 , was because , uh , most of your , uh , air conditioning \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ on \] vehicles tend *-3 to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
151969:56	###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###and I mean , N_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###so , uh , that 's why I \[ stayed in , \+ stayed more \[ towar- , \+ towards , \] \] uh , uh , N_S ###and that 's a \[ pollut- , \+ polluting \] type deal too , is the excessive , um , you know , uh , petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth , ###and the dirt and grit and those two mixed * together \[ with , \+ with \] water \[ and , \+ \] uh , really \[ make , \+ uh , make \] a mess .

151976:20	###and that 's a \[ pollut- , \+ polluting \] type deal too , is the excessive , um , you know , uh , petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth , ###and the dirt and grit and those two mixed * together \[ with , \+ with \] water \[ and , \+ \] uh , really \[ make , \+ uh , make \] a mess . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Um , yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I hate *-1 to see a car *ICH*-3 *ICH*-2 going down the street , or even a truck or bus for that matter , that *T*-4 's putting out a lot of dark smoke , E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh .

151992:52	###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###because \[ when you , \+ when diesel \] is burned *-1 *T*-2 it 's it , N_S ###you know diesel fuel is burned *-1 \[ in a , \+ in the \] diesel engine E_S ###it 's burned *-1 so completely , that you do n't have any , uh , nitrous oxides , uh , or oxides of nitrogen , uh , 0 * to , uh , form *T*-4 \[ because of , \+ by virtue of \] the very combustion process of the diesel engine , because diesel oil \[ is , \+ uh , is \] not very volatile .

151996:25	###you know diesel fuel is burned *-1 \[ in a , \+ in the \] diesel engine E_S ###it 's burned *-1 so completely , that you do n't have any , uh , nitrous oxides , uh , or oxides of nitrogen , uh , 0 * to , uh , form *T*-4 \[ because of , \+ by virtue of \] the very combustion process of the diesel engine , because diesel oil \[ is , \+ uh , is \] not very volatile .

152012:11	###SpeakerA39 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###and so if the car sucks in , uh , fifty degrees , N_S 
152048:4	###SpeakerB10 . ###Well , uh , \[ we , \+ we \] do a lot of canoeing when we go *-1 camping *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###and \[ we , \+ uh , we \] also , uh , carry all our equipment with us E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###and so we canoe down the river and then , sleep on the river on one of the , um , sand bars and then get up the next morning , cook our breakfast , and go down the river again .

152050:48	###SpeakerA11 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###and \[ we , \+ uh , we \] also , uh , carry all our equipment with us E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###SpeakerB16 . 
152072:54	###So we 've tried *-1 to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out , E_S ###and we have gone up into the mountains and , uh , not necessarily roughed it , E_S ###but we have just found it *EXP*-1 just real enjoyable * to be alone up in the mountains . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Well , that 's good . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And , then \[ the boys are , \+ our boys are \] old enough now , E_S ###they 're twelve and eleven , E_S ###and so , they 're involved in the scouting E_S ###and they do a lot of camping with the scouts E_S 
152094:22	###Do they like it where they have tents *T*-1 E_S ###and , uh , do they cook on stoves ?

152121:11	###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh , it 's just a piece of material \[ that *T*-1 has , \+ uh , that *T*-2 has \] a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent uh , like a , uh *T*-3 , N_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###they 're very light weight E_S ###and we use them when we go *-1 backpacking *T*-2 . E_S

152188:13	###SpeakerA65 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh , they 're covered *-1 like with a heavy armor type stuff , E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . 
152249:44	###so I 'm pretty satisfied myself . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Um , what 's your situation *T*-1 ?

152283:55	###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , that 's good . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's one of the things 0 I guess 0 I would change *T*-1 about Honeywell , is , uh , N_S ###I used *-1 to work with the Army Research Institute , E_S ###and * being \[ a , \+ uh , a \] government organization you got quite a few holidays off . E_S 
152309:4	###SpeakerB30 . ###Well , I think , uh , 0 \[ the , \+ the \] health care , of course , is an important *RNR*-2 , and has *-1 to be the single most important *RNR*-2 benefit E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh .

152366:16	###SpeakerB52 . ###Well , we have two different plans that we can subscribe to *T*-1 under dental , uh , depending , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] the cost between them \[ is very , \+ is very \] little .

152387:36	###SpeakerA59 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh .

152387:155	###SpeakerA59 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh .

152403:71	###SpeakerA67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###That determines how much , uh , vacation time they get *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 'm kind of interested because \[ I 'm \+ actually , that 's the route 0 I 'd \] like *-1 to take *T*-2 when I finally get my degree *T*-3 \[ is * to , \+ uh , is * to \] teach in a university . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . 
152407:12	###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 'm kind of interested because \[ I 'm \+ actually , that 's the route 0 I 'd \] like *-1 to take *T*-2 when I finally get my degree *T*-3 \[ is * to , \+ uh , is * to \] teach in a university .

E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Right , E_S ###and in the case of the University of New Hampshire , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay Karen . E_S ###\[ You- , \+ you 're \] first . E_S 
152459:10	###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###somewhat that , E_S ###but then also there just is n't the ability * to in one sense have , uh , a broader scope for * rewarding people for their performances . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh , so that 's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution *T*-1 , E_S ###uh , it *EXP*-1 's a little more difficult * to recognize an individual 's performance E_S ###SpeakerB16 . 
152467:27	###uh , it *EXP*-1 's a little more difficult * to recognize an individual 's performance E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###and I suppose 0 that 's maybe a disadvantage of * being in a larger institution , perhaps somewhat even with the business , uh . E_S ###But I agree , you know , 0 the , uh , medical benefits and those kinds of things *ICH*-1 are one of the big pluses of * working for a large organization and also the , uh , security aspect for long term employment , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Well , you know that 's interesting though . E_S ###Because I do n't know if that 's necessarily the case anymore . E_S ###I use *-1 to think that , you know , after you work , N_S 
152498:183	###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###No doubt E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###yeah . E_S 
152511:85	###it 's where it 's most expedient *T*-1 which , ###Well , in one sense for us , it 's where it makes the least noise *T*-1 which *T*-2 means 0 it 's often the lowest support type roles .

152519:37	###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh . E_S ###See , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###So we , N_S ###SpeakerB38 . 
152537:54	###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###And then they wonder why it does n't get done *-1 in the same amount of time *T*-2 . E_S ###Well , those people are n't there anymore . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S ###Because it 's support people that *T*-1 are providing the speed for it . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S 
152537:77	###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###And then they wonder why it does n't get done *-1 in the same amount of time *T*-2 . E_S ###Well , those people are n't there anymore .

152555:8	###SpeakerA49 . ###Well the , uh , N_S ###that 's maybe the majority of the importance , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###because my perspective is from an institution , E_S ###uh , \[ the , \+ there \] is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . 
152605:9	###SpeakerB2 . ###I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###In what way ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###In that it seems to me that they are swayed *-1 more *ICH*-4 by emotion than , uh , by evidence that *T*-2 's presented *-3 .

152652:31	###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh , I think that , uh , in such cases , uh , they are not really looking for unbiased people , but rather for biased . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh , now I happen *-1 to know several judges E_S ###and there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has \[ me- , \+ \] doing sentencing without the jury . ###I would feel a little bit uneasy about E_S 
152652:109	###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh , I think that , uh , in such cases , uh , they are not really looking for unbiased people , but rather for biased .

152672:23	###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###I , guess 0 \[ I , \+ I \] definitely agree with you , E_S ###but \[ sin- , \+ \] the N_S ###well , what I do n't like *T*-1 about , uh , \[ sentence , \+ the jury doing the sentencing \] in that I think 0 it becomes a lot less , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###\[ the , \+ the \] same crime gets unequal sentences . E_S 
152678:10	###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###\[ the , \+ the \] same crime gets unequal sentences . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###This is very true . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 there is more of an ability \[ of \+ you know , you know for \] * selecting \[ a jury , \+ two different juries \] that *T*-1 would most of the time come up with \[ the same idea , \+ uh , the same idea \] versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
152696:68	###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###but one individual got twenty-five years E_S ###and the other one was sentenced *-1 to life . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA47 . 
152721:11	###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###Every now and then one is tempted *-1 *-1 to see \[ what , \+ what . \] E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I agree . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###But , \[ I , \+ it *EXP*-2 's taken me \] a long time * to understand that , uh , lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice \[ as we think of , \+ you know , \[ as , \+ as \] novices tend *-1 to think \] that , uh , attorneys care about justice . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
152744:29	###SpeakerB64 . ###And they are very effective too . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###That the , N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh , even , N_S ###I have been involved , uh , just \[ sli- , \+ slightly \] in a case where I know 0 the person is guilty *T*-1 E_S 
152754:52	###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###but , uh , his attorneys gotten him off . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh , the city has dropped their charges against him because \[ their , \+ the \] attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt * to convince the judge . E_S ###So I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . 
152770:9	###SpeakerB2 . ###I agree . E_S ###I think 0 taxes are high . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Right , E_S ###uh , where you live *T*-1 do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
152776:10	###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh , uh-huh . E_S ###In New Hampshire we have , uh , uh , \[ no , \+ no , \] what we call *T*-1 broad base taxes . E_S ###No income tax and no sales tax . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . 
152782:51	###No income tax and no sales tax . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh , we tax business , uh , eight percent , E_S ###businesses are taxed *-1 eight percent E_S ###and we have what we call *T*-1 the five B s *ICH*-2 .

152789:13	###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###So , uh , we do have a very low tax rate , E_S ###but you know , combined with the federal income tax . I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes E_S ###and MUMBLEx . N_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
152803:45	###well if you do get money back from like jobs , N_S ###I 'm still a student ###so , uh , I only work part time , E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###so \[ I , \+ I \] get a check back E_S ###so N_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Well that 's nice . E_S 
152826:26	###SpeakerB20 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh , \[ my , \+ my \] opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state E_S and they say 0 they are going *-1 to send some back , E_S ###\[ it 's like * giving yourself a tra- , \+ it 's like one arm giving the other a transfusion . \] E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###You know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S 
152836:11	###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh , \[ it , \+ it \] really , uh , N_S ###I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube \[ because , \+ ###Right ###because , \] uh , there 's an old saying *ICH*-1 in amongst taxes and politicians that there 's a fly paper effect E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###There you go *T*-1 . E_S 
152848:33	###and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol *T*-1 , uh , a lot of it stays there ###and not that much comes back to you . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###I , N_S ###* do n't seem like they are doing much with it , E_S 
152849:7	###and not that much comes back to you . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###I , N_S ###* do n't seem like they are doing much with it , E_S ###MUMBLEx I mean there 's plans there E_S 
152867:16	###but taxes get raise *-1 E_S ###so . I do n't know . E_S ###I 'm not really into politics , uh E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###That it , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###I do n't really understand it E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
152893:9	###and then there would be a set amount for however many \[ people , \+ you know , dependent \] you have *T*-1 , E_S ###and you would just pay a flat tax . No exemptions , no deductions or anything else \[ after \+ you know , after \] you figure up who *T*-1 's in your family . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Right . E_S ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S E_S ###and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S 
152895:86	###SpeakerB42 . ###Right . E_S ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S E_S ###and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###The could be nice . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . 
152941:29	###SpeakerB58 . ###Um , no E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Twenty percent ? E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] have no idea , E_S ###I just . N_S ###My dad does it all for me . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###\[ Just , \+ you just \] pay it , huh . E_S 
152955:42	###and , uh , she works as a waitress E_S ###and she is attending college full time also E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###and she sends her taxes to me E_S ###and I figure them up . E_S ###She really has no idea . E_S ###She gets a refund check E_S ###and , N_S

153288:11	###Ours is , uh , like a cockapoo . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###I think 0 it 's half cocker spaniel and half poodle . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###But , it 's a really good dog . E_S ###SpeakerB54 .

153381:4	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , uh , I mean I do n't think that guns should be outlawed *-1 E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Um .

153404:19	###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###There is no national , N_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###But , it 's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun , especially if you have the money 0 * to pay for it *T*-1 .

153596:41	###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###I am single , E_S ###so . I guess , ###I do n't know if that 's an excuse for * not having a tight budget , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###but I basically , N_S

E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###We *ICH*-2 're doing some here \[ in , \+ in \] Cash Valley , the community here . E_S ###SpeakerB18 .

154786:21	###The one 0 I think 0 *T*-1 is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that , uh , the industry seems *-2 to be doing *T*-3 with the recycled polymers .

E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Oh really . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###He came to the conclusion , 0 plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] low weight , but it 's high volume ###so it takes up a lot of space E_S

156171:76	###SpeakerA35 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Right .

156195:56	###SpeakerA45 . ###Right .

157372:46	###SpeakerB60 . ###Oh , really ?

157474:27	###\[ but , \+ so , \] I guess 0 \[ the , \+ the \] question was more like , uh , do you \[ get what you pay f- , \+ you know , get what you pay for *T*-1 . \] E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , I , N_S ###it just depends .

E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###There 's , N_S 
157475:114	###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , I , N_S ###it just depends .

E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###There 's , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
157486:90	###we have not paid them really what they 're worth *T*-2 in what they contribute *T*-3 to society . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh .

157499:96	###I go to a state sponsored school E_S ###and , uh , my education all up through high school and stuff , N_S ###so I guess 0 I 'm kind of in debt , \[ I , \+ I \] suppose , because I do n't , you know , been paying taxes \[ all that , \+ all that \] long .

157528:7	###SpeakerA23 . ###More taxes you pay *T*-1 .

E_S ###Is n't , N_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh , last year when they passed the tax laws for the , uh , nineteen ninety , ninety-one , whatever , nineteen ninety-one *T*-1 uh , I added up all the taxes that we were going *-2 to pay *T*-3 on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else , E_S 
157538:15	###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###and I totaled them all up E_S ###and basically , uh , we were going *-1 to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Wow . E_S 
157557:129	###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###there 's a \[ lot , \+ yeah , lot \] of hidden taxes .

157577:4	###was it Jerry Brown , E_S ###one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for * doing away with all \[ the , \+ the \] tax codes 0 they have *T*-1 now and implementing \[ a f- , \+ I think a flat \] percentage , something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah , E_S ###if you \[ impl- , \+ implemented \] a flat percentage , it would encourage people , uh , *-1 to make more money E_S ###and \[ the , \+ \] what people need *-1 to understand *T*-2 in my opinion , now this is just my opinion , okay , uh , is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###And , so , if they penalize businesses , business people are smart enough *-1 to say , here 's *T*-2 my break point , 
157583:22	###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###Exactly . E_S 
157599:15	###you 're talking to an employer . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###SpeakerA57 . ###Up until , like , eighty-five or something was the , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Hi . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay . E_S ###So , uh , with the issue of trial by jury , uh , I actually found the whole question about whether you need \[ \[ a , \+ a unan- , \] \+ a unanimous \] verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting . E_S 
157616:136	###SpeakerB5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I actually thought 0 I 'd read that , too E_S ###and that 's why I phrased it that way *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###I wonder , E_S ###\[ the difference , \+ yeah , the difference \] could be that for , uh , \[ state , \+ if there is such a thing , state \] felonies versus federal felonies that \[ federal , \+ things that *T*-1 are under federal \] jurisdiction require the unanimous vote , E_S ###and things that *T*-1 are under state jurisdiction , even criminal do n't require , N_S 
157620:13	###SpeakerA6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###I wonder , E_S ###\[ the difference , \+ yeah , the difference \] could be that for , uh , \[ state , \+ if there is such a thing , state \] felonies versus federal felonies that \[ federal , \+ things that *T*-1 are under federal \] jurisdiction require the unanimous vote , E_S ###and things that *T*-1 are under state jurisdiction , even criminal do n't require , N_S ###but I do n't know what \[ the , \+ the \] laws , N_S ###do you think that that 's an unreasonable , uh , requirement that they be unanimous ? E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###Well , I 'd be curious as to what the , uh , requirement for \[ a , \+ an \] acquittal is *T*-1 . E_S 
157627:18	###do you think that that 's an unreasonable , uh , requirement that they be unanimous ? E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###Well , I 'd be curious as to what the , uh , requirement for \[ a , \+ an \] acquittal is *T*-1 . E_S ###And \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be wrong * to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if , you know , six or seven voted * not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal . E_S ###But I do n't know whether you need \[ an , \+ a \] unanimous , uh , vote of not guilty *-1 to acquit . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that , \+ that \] would be an interesting change . E_S ###It was also allow the , uh , idea that if you had one person who *T*-1 was , uh , very disagreeable that ###, I mean , \[ it , \+ it \] fundamentally changes the way 0 the processing occurs *T*-2 because , uh , \[ the fact that it 's w- , \+ \[ the , \+ the \] principle is that the fact that it 's \] unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt , uh , criterion that it , uh , increases \[ the , \+ the \] likelihood of * getting the proper judgment . E_S 
157630:28	###And \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be wrong * to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if , you know , six or seven voted * not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal .

E_S ###So , \[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 if anything , it would have *-1 to be a very close to unanimous decision . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Yeah , E_S 
157636:48	###, I mean , \[ it , \+ it \] fundamentally changes the way 0 the processing occurs *T*-2 because , uh , \[ the fact that it 's w- , \+ \[ the , \+ the \] principle is that the fact that it 's \] unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt , uh , criterion that it , uh , increases \[ the , \+ the \] likelihood of * getting the proper judgment .

E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Yeah , E_S ###actually \[ I , \+ I \] thought that that would be very interesting thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . 
157662:30	###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 'd read one book , I think 0 it was calls *-1 TRIAL BY JURY of all things , that , uh *T*-2 went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases , and in many cases *-3 looking \[ at what *T*-4 had , \+ \] at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right , went back to the jurors , uh , based on the deliberations .

157683:37	###SpeakerB27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] understand .

157732:56	###but , uh , \[ I was , \+ I was \] working *-1 to get through college \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , trying *-1 to make it through that , E_S ###but , uh , I 'm married and have , uh , \[ a , \+ a \] couple of children E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###and we have *-1 to , uh , pretty much stick to a budget .

161778:30	###SpeakerA67 . ###Oh , that 's great . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###And we had a \[ n- , \+ \] different boat every day . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Oh , that 's fantastic .

161808:39	###Uh , my family 's pretty into it E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###and , uh , I took sailing lessons when I was about six *T*-1 E_S ###and then , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Is it pretty easy ? E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah , E_S 
161813:25	###and then , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Is it pretty easy ?

E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###So \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] not too bad , E_S 
161819:37	###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . 
161819:114	###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah .

161826:32	###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###SpeakerB84 . ###Well , that 's about all 0 we have *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###lot of people \[ do n't , \+ do n't \] see the excitement in sailing , E_S ###but , then , again , \[ they may \[ nev- , \+ m- , \] \+ they may never \] have tried anything like , uh , catamaran E_S 
161840:20	###\[ you actually , \+ some catamarans you can actually \] pull people *ICH*-1 behind *T*-2 , the skiers , E_S ###they get so fast , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###I did n't know that .

161866:22	###SpeakerA97 . ###Well , \[ he , \+ uh , he 's \] from Detroit E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###We 're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast , E_S ###and there 's a lot of places there 0 you can go *T*-1 , you know . E_S ###\[ So , \+ uh , so \] that 's a good thing . E_S 
161881:11	###SpeakerB102 . ###Uh , I build transformers . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Okay , E_S ###is that for T I E_S ###or , N_S 
161919:4	###SpeakerB118 . ###It 's real nice . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###Yeah ? E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###* Been here all my life . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###Oh , no doubt . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Yeah . E_S 
161982:52	###I mean , it seems like \[ \[ our , \+ our , \] \+ the \] prison systems , we ca n't seem *-1 to decide whether or not it 's a reform system or penal system . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 most people regard it as a warehouse . Where you put away the people that *T*-1 are so bad that , uh , you do n't want them out in circulation *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###\[ But , \+ but \] the problem \[ is , \+ is \] that \[ we , \+ we \] only have but so much room E_S ###and \[ we , \+ we \] try *-1 to put aside in the warehouse , E_S 
161986:37	###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
161993:44	###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###That 's what I hear *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###So it 's , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S 
161999:11	###SpeakerA23 . ###So it 's , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think , you know , N_S ###do n't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea ? E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###I get the feeling that a lot of people have *?* . E_S ###I 'm not convinced *-1 that I have *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
162049:19	###but I just assume 0 it was something that she could hit *T*-1 immediately \[ and , \+ and \] really annoy a lot of people . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###But , uh , you know MUMBLEx , N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###So she did n't feel safe . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###No , E_S ###she did n't . E_S 
162061:39	###and then later on \[ the , \+ uh , the \] administration kept *-1 getting worse , E_S ###and , uh , she got a couple of inmates that \[ she was n't , \+ she did n't \] feel quite as comfortable around *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah .

162087:77	###and it 's , uh , N_S ###you can get pretty hardened , I 'm sure 0 *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
162118:20	###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah , E_S ###there 's not enough beds and treatment programs , rising drug abuse , E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . ###and , yep , E_S ###it 's a mess .

162273:43	###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###But , you know I 've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###That 's right .

162316:32	###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###So , I guess 0 you 'd have *-1 to say , 0 if I was looking , I would definitely be looking for a foreign car .

162338:4	###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah , E_S ###because I guess , uh , N_S ###I mean , well , ninety-twos , * granted *-1 , ###but the new ones , you know N_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###fourteen to sixteen is what they go for *T*-1 on the lot , E_S ###SpeakerB80 .

163186:6	###SpeakerA17 . ###That 's true . E_S ###You d- , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Well , How would you go about *-2 changing it *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . 
163193:9	###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###You know , that 's a , N_S ###I 've nailed the problem down E_S ###but I , N_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###* Leave the details up to somebody else , huh . E_S 
163206:45	###I think , 0 * to begin with , \[ you would h- , \+ you would have , \] N_S ###like , here in Atlanta area , our crime rate is just astronomical , E_S ###yet , you go out on the streets E_S ###and they 're giving speeding tickets . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###I think 0 somehow you have *-1 to separate the revenues from , N_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Well , you know , uh , * talking about the lawyers , you know what *T*-1 might very well \[ do , \+ uh , cause \] \[ a , \+ uh , a \] drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is * to set the fees for cases . E_S 
163216:50	###It 's kind of like * \[ do it , \+ do it \] in the similar vein \[ similar , \+ like , \] uh , V C R or television repair . E_S ###If you take your T V in , a lot of these T V repair places will say , well , I 'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars , E_S ###and if he gets in there and starts *-1 rooting around and finds something in there that *T*-2 's really tremendously wrong with it , then he eats it . E_S ###\[ He , \+ he \] repairs it , gives it back to you , and takes your hundred dollars . E_S ###Now , if he comes in and says , you know , I 'll repair \[ your , \+ your \] V C R , or somebody else 's V C R , for a hundred dollars , gets in there , N_S maybe it 's a blown fuse , E_S ###* takes him two minutes , E_S ###he fixes it , E_S ###he still charges you that hundred dollars .

E_S 
163232:8	###SpeakerA33 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###And here 's *T*-2 this bum that *T*-1 did n't have a job E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###and he 's got a attorney that you and I could never afford *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###That 's true . E_S 
163244:4	###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Um , \[ \[ y- , \+ well , you , \] \+ you know , you 're \] talking to part of them that *T*-1 's paying for that .

163256:21	###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , that 's another problem . E_S ###I think 0 *-1 to really correct the judicial system , you have *-1 to get the lawyers out of it . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . ###I mean , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever , E_S ###and with that type person running it , I mean , \[ you , \+ you \] could expect that you , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S 
163289:54	###I guess 0 the , uh , city \[ is , \+ has \] bought the big green trash cans E_S ###and , uh , \[ we , \+ they \] have a recycling truck that *T*-1 comes around now E_S ###and you separate your glass and paper and , uh , aluminum E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh .

163325:66	###but I do n't know if they \[ get a , \+ get anything \] back on it E_S ###or , do you get money for it ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###No , E_S ###\[ I just , \+ I \] noticed it E_S ###Iowa and other cities like that , it 's a nickel per aluminum can . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###So you do n't see too many *ICH*-1 thrown * out around the streets . Or even bottles . E_S 
163341:103	###SpeakerA27 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###\[ I n- , \+ I \] remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###And \[ now , \+ now \] most of them are throwaway . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
163341:139	###SpeakerA27 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###\[ I n- , \+ I \] remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###And \[ now , \+ now \] most of them are throwaway . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA31 .

163362:21	###SpeakerB36 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###And , \[ it was , \+ they come \] in like , uh , \[ eight \[ and , \+ and \] \+ eight and \] ten packs , you know instead of six packs E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Right .

163379:33	###\[ but \+ but \] \[ it 's , \+ uh , it 's \] quite , N_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Right .

163430:9	###SpeakerB64 . ###That 's right , E_S ###that 's right . E_S ###It 's like * washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Right , E_S ###uh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###We all do it . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . 
163445:17	###SpeakerB70 . ###Oh , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 two or three minutes is fine . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###I- , N_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###Is that it ? E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . 
163489:48	###because \[ w- , \+ when \] I went *-1 to work for them *T*-2 , uh , they did n't do that , E_S ###but , uh , since then \[ they 've , \+ they 've \] started a drug testing policy , not because of their own , uh , convictions , but because the clients of our company \[ are \+ \] requests that we do that .

E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Other than that they do n't have random testing or anything like that , E_S ###but , a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first .

163558:43	###and \[ tha- , \+ they \] did n't find any problem with that , you know , E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Right .

163603:29	###\[ and , \+ and \] \[ it 's , \+ it was \] kind of a long story , E_S ###but \[ it was , \+ it was \] just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through *T*-1 , E_S ###and it amounted to , uh , * going in , uh , before any of these interviews , E_S ###I 'm not even working for this company , E_S ###I 'm going in for , like , interviews E_S ###and they flew me out to Chicago E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , before I went into any of the interviews , uh , they took me to the doctor *-1 to give me a physical .

163629:34	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a really hard question . E_S ###I do know that , uh , politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths .

163649:56	###SpeakerB4 . ###Right .

164429:51	###SpeakerB54 . ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I know that \[ \[ a , \+ a lot of the \] \+ lot of \] murders that you hear about *T*-1 are people that *T*-2 know each other . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###I mean , ###Yeah . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Right . E_S 
165108:96	###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###and I think 0 the difference for me was that \[ \[ my parents were , \+ you know , they were definitely , \] \+ they were always \] there , E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah .

165123:7	###SpeakerA2 . ###Uh , not too bad really .

165175:53	###SpeakerB19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###but , uh , you know , the transmission may be made *-1 in Japan or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Uh , like I 've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] I know for a fact that the transmission is made *-1 by Mitsubishi . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . 
165188:28	###SpeakerB25 . ###Yeah , E_S ###really . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###But , uh , that 's the way 0 it is *T*-1 . E_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] personally feel that , uh , uh , if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them , you know , that 's the way 0 it goes *T*-1 E_S ###and , you know , people , \[ man- , \+ \] more than manufacturers should get a clue E_S ###and , you know , they should start *-1 making quality products . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . 
165204:11	###SpeakerB29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Uh , they 've got \[ all the American , \+ well , \[ all the , \+ all the \] cars \] rated *-1 , you know , E_S ###and , uh , essentially , \[ I h- , \+ I do n't \] see much of a trend .

E_S ###There 's nothing wrong with them . ###Uh , and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars . E_S ###But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy E_S ###and they 're pieces of junk . E_S 
165238:15	###SpeakerA38 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###because technology is so , uh , you know , volatile and changing all the time . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###And can you think of any other industry where ###in software they , N_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB41 . 
165282:4	###SpeakerA56 . ###Yeah , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###They 'd sell more if they were honest .

E_S ###SpeakerA3 . 
165386:7	###and they , N_S ###I had them , N_S ###the other thing 0 I let them do *T*-1 some times is that I let them go through and \[ let them tell me what , \+ let them do \] the diagnostics .

E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###And they told me that \[ my , \+ my \] brake pads were gosh , you know , seventy percent still good , you know , E_S 
165416:7	###I bought the truck with about sixty thousand , ###I have almost one hundred and ten , E_S ###so I drove on those brake pads for , uh , you know , forty-five thousand miles E_S ###and there was hardly any wear to them .

E_S ###You know , it 's not dirty . E_S 
165478:10	###SpeakerA33 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###and , uh , probably about four months ago the water pump decided *-1 to go out . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh , oh .

165803:34	###and it 's so much easier , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###So . Have you heard about Saturns ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###I 've heard some about Saturns . E_S ###I do n't know a lot about them . E_S ###I have n't been over , uh , to a dealer *-2 to look at them although I did see something in tonight 's paper that *T*-1 said that their , uh reliability is rated *-3 to be equal to that of \[ the , \+ I guess , the \] Japanese cars .

165821:38	###SpeakerB8 . ###Um . Yeah , E_S ###I 've heard 0 a lot of people like them . E_S ###Uh , yet I do n't know \[ wh- , \+ whether \] I would buy Saturn or not at this point .

165837:19	###cause I do \[ al- , \+ almost \] all my own maintenance and , uh those types of things . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And , uh , yo- , N_S 
165858:7	###It 's not worth my time . E_S ###You ca n't get in there . E_S ###You ca n't do anything . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And it 's so complicated too . E_S ###I look at it E_S ###and I say , boy , you know , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I 'd \] have *-1 to almost go *-2 take a class or something like that . E_S 
165905:47	###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###And I 've always been very impressed with the Taurus . E_S ###It 's a really nice car . E_S ###I think 0 \[ it 's very \+ , it 's a \] stylish car both inside and out . E_S ###It 's comfortable 0 * to drive *T*-2 . E_S ###Uh , reasonable performance , E_S ###and this is out in California \[ where , \+ where \] they do n't make a car that *T*-1 's got reasonable performance anymore *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
165914:35	###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh , I 've been real impressed with that . E_S ###Yo- , N_S ###and I did n't realize that they were putting dual , uh , air bags in that car now . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Ninety , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###Or , * excuse me , the ninety-twos . E_S 
165945:4	###A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Year old ninety-two or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Sure . E_S ###Those are N_S ###SpeakerA55 . 
165968:23	###\[ What , \+ what \] *T*-1 attracts you to the Saturns ? E_S ###\[ Or , \+ or , \] of course , we 've already talked , you know , N_S ###the Taurus is safe . E_S ###But \[ wh- , \+ what \] kind of things are you looking for *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Well , the Saturns you can get air bags in them . E_S ###I do n't think 0 you can get dual side air bags . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . 
165969:16	###\[ Or , \+ or , \] of course , we 've already talked , you know , N_S ###the Taurus is safe . E_S ###But \[ wh- , \+ what \] kind of things are you looking for *T*-1 ?

E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###But one of \[ the , \+ the \] two things that I 'm really , N_S 
165972:19	###SpeakerA61 . ###Well , the Saturns you can get air bags in them . E_S ###I do n't think 0 you can get dual side air bags . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###But one of \[ the , \+ the \] two things that I 'm really , N_S ###\[ \[ the , \+ the \] \+ I 'd say 0 the \] most important thing is a car that *T*-1 's not going *-2 to fall apart . That *T*-3 does n't have problems . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
165987:35	###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Because you see the reliability and the types of problems 0 they have *T*-1 E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] the two cars that *T*-1 apparently are close to that . That *T*-2 actually have high reliability , the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###And the other one \[ is , \+ are \] the Saturns . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . 
166006:4	###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , basically , they 're just , uh , having various recycling , uh , bins , uh , located *-1 for , uh , trash pickup . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well that 's more than we have *?* up here in Massachusetts . E_S ###\[ Some , \+ some \] local communities are very active \[ in that , \+ uh , in that \] respect E_S ###and they do have bins set * up . E_S ###But I live in \[ a , \+ a \] metropolitan area E_S ###and , uh , they 're not , uh , too inclined *-1 to do something as aggressive as that . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
166023:21	###SpeakerA7 . ###\[ \[ I , \+ I know 0 a lot , \] \+ I think 0 a lot \] of , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] issues with regard to recycling are that , uh , people have *-1 to be motivated *-2 \[ to do , \+ to do \] something like that because it does take extra effort . E_S ###Whether N_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ and I think that , \] \+ and I know \] 0 Massachusetts has , N_S ###a bottle bill was passed *-1 E_S ###and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now , E_S ###and the majority of the incentive in * recycling bottles probably , * believe it or not , is just * to get the extra nickel at \[ the , uh , \+ the \] store and not , uh , N_S ###that 's the majority of people that I know of *T*-1 anyways . E_S ###Where people are n't really , you know , eco conscious *T*-3 . It 's just the fact that it 's something 0 they have *-2 to do *T*-1 . E_S ###And I 'm not going *-1 to throw a bottle away , E_S 
166032:5	###And I 'm not going *-1 to throw a bottle away , E_S ###it 's like * throwing a nickel away . E_S ###That type of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Right . E_S ###\[ \[ They , \+ Th- , \] \+ here they 're \] trying *-1 to push through a bill E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###But , uh , people need *-1 to be more conscious of it . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###and a lot of people are against it . E_S 
166058:148	###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's a good idea . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###\[ Th- , \+ there \] definitely has *-1 to be a motivation factor E_S ###and I know that , \[ at w- , \+ where I work *T*-1 , \] N_S 
166074:40	###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , \[ I know , \+ uh , I believe \] 0 it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books *T*-1 . E_S ###* Uh , usually have them come from MUMBLEx you know , projects *-1 to collect old ones . E_S ###* Usually just get dumped *-1 out with the trash . E_S ###And phone books are a large volume of annual trash . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ They , \+ they \] just , N_S ###matter of fact , \[ that , \+ that \] reminded me of an article 0 I saw *T*-1 in the pa- , N_S ###the local schools , you could send your phone book \[ to your , \+ uh , \[ to , \+ with \] your \] kid to school E_S 
166085:7	###Because there was an article or a story done * awhile ago that , uh , \[ trash , \+ uh , the telephone books \] are the type of thing that *T*-1 do n't break down over a long period of time . E_S ###A guy went to \[ a d- , \+ a landfill , \] dug down five feet \[ and , \+ and \] pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty E_S ###because \[ they do n't , \+ they do n't \] degrade over such a period of time . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Well , part of the problem with * recycling them in the past has been 0 the covers are made *-1 with a clay based paper . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###They contain the glue and stuff E_S ###and they used *-1 to have *-2 to take out all the , uh , pages and then cut the spine off *-3 to be able *-4 to recycle them . E_S 
166106:9	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I would say 0 as , far as social changes go *?* , uh , I think 0 *T*-1 families were more together . E_S ###\[ They , \+ they \] did more things together . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , they ate dinner at the table together . E_S ###Uh , the parents usually took out \[ time , \+ uh , you know , more time \] than they do now *-1 to come with the children and just spend the day *-2 doing a family activity . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
166119:9	###SpeakerA7 . ###We , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###Well , uh , actually ten years from today seems rather short . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh , but I do agree that , uh , generally \[ it 's , \+ society \] has sort of , uh , * let 's see , rushed everything ahead . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
166151:21	###SpeakerA21 . ###I 'm twenty-eight . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Twenty-eight . E_S ###Okay , E_S ###I 'm twenty-three . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###So there 's maybe a five year gap between us . E_S 
166168:22	###SpeakerB28 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###And now , uh , it *EXP*-1 's pretty much an economic necessity \[ \[ of , \+ for most , \] \+ in most \] places for both parents to work . E_S 
166206:138	###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###SpeakerB50 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . 
166222:4	###SpeakerA55 . ###I 'm saying that \[ the , \+ uh , the \] group that *T*-1 is just trying *-2 to survive from day to day , where both parents are working *T*-4 is more of the majority \[ than the , \+ than the \] people that *T*-3 have the higher standard of living . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who *T*-1 has the money and who *T*-2 the decreasing , uh , middle class in this country I think that that 's , in my opinion , the case .

166228:43	###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###SpeakerB60 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###So .

166258:46	###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] just \[ graduating col- , \+ graduating from college . \] E_S ###Uh , I did n't really perceive much \[ of a , \+ of a \] problem with the school system .

E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###Uh , I have n't , N_S 
166277:11	###SpeakerB6 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###But , uh , it seems like when \[ I li- , \+ I lived \] in Chicago *T*-1 , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I 've \] lived down here .

166302:96	###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , well , I do n't pretend *-1 to understand that either .

167026:15	###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh .

167043:78	###SpeakerA33 . ###Um .

167250:112	###So if you have someone \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 destroys that value uh , then \[ what \+ \] you want *-2 to take steps * to , uh , minimize the loss . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB22 . 
167272:84	###But one way of * doing it is , uh , by income .

167282:217	###well N_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###I suppose 0 you could say , well that has something 0 *T*-1 to do with potential for rehabilitation .

167315:13	###SpeakerA45 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###They found him E_S ###and he is on trial for capital murder . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###So it has n't been a long time ago . E_S ###Just recently .

E_S ###Uh , I 've , N_S ###the high school 0 I went to *T*-1 \[ was , \+ uh , was \] a good one also .

E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah . E_S 
167859:4	###SpeakerA21 . ###\[ And , \+ uh you know , and so \] the students were , you know , to some extent , motivated *-1 to learn . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###I mean you know . N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And I 'm also N_S 
167872:42	###yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###\[ But \+ , but , \] uh , I think , I mean 0 even more than that , even , I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able *-1 to read , you know ?

167872:252	###yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true .

167877:133	###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###now I think maybe 0 it 's started *-1 changing in the past few years because , uh , they have \[ of \+ \] these , uh , sort of \[ mandatory \+ , -tory \] tests \[ if \+ \] 0 you have *-2 to take *T*-3 before you get a diploma . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Right . E_S 
167894:60	###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###But these people obviously were n't *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###That 's hard 0 for me to say *T*-1 since \[ I did n't , \+ I did n't \] really grow , N_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . ###well when I went to elementary school *T*-1 \[ it , \+ it \] was n't in a great area E_S ###but \[ \[ I still , \+ I mean , I learned * to read , \] \+ started *-1 learning *-2 to read \] when I was in kindergarten *T*-3 , you know .

167904:84	###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###So I guess 0 \[ I ca n't really \+ I ca n't \] say what it *EXP*-2 would be like *T*-1 * to , uh , grow up in a really oppressed region . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . 
167908:50	###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###You know , I guess 0 \[ the whole , \+ the whole \] environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the MUMBLEx people . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And I think 0 that 's almost a bigger factor , than anything else probably . E_S 
167929:201	###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###I think 0 that 'd be an interesting experience . E_S 
167996:42	###and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Huh . E_S ###Well , here in Seattle , uh , \[ it 's g- , \+ the air 's getting \] more and more polluted . E_S ###\[ We 're , \+ uh , we 're \] in kind of a basin . E_S ###And , uh , Seattle is on Puget Sound which *T*-1 is a inland waterway between two mountains .

E_S ###I think 0 most of it is from cars . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###SpeakerA6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Definitely . E_S ###Here in Utah up along the Wasatch MUMBLEx along the western side \[ of the , \+ of these \] Rocky Mountains here , where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo *T*-1 E_S and Logan 's up in the valley a little bit further north , E_S we get a lot of pollution E_S 
168012:73	###and it 's like seventy percent of it is from cars . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###And , uh , it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion *T*-1 . E_S And when we \[ get , \+ get \] cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###SpeakerA10 . ###and it just sits and sits and sits E_S ###and we 're starting *-2 to hit pollution levels *ICH*-3 now on the Wasatch front which *T*-1 match that of L A a few years ago .

E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###\[ It 's not , \+ it 's \] almost sad .

E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I live in the , university district E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###SpeakerB15 . ###and , uh , uh , it 's supposed *-1 to have about the worst air pollution . E_S ###I think probably due to , uh , a lot of students going back and forth to school . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . 
168042:24	###emissions . N_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###MUMBLEx have they started *-1 doing that yet ? E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###They 've actually started *-1 doing it down along the , N_S ###not in Logan up here cause we 're doing a lot better . E_S ###\[ We have a lot , \+ population is a lot \] lighter up here . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . 
168067:47	###Kind of like a radar gun . E_S ###And ... N_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Oh , really , E_S ###You mean 0 they could do that remotely ? E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###SpeakerA30 . ###Yeah . E_S 
168067:128	###Kind of like a radar gun . E_S ###And ... N_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Oh , really , E_S ###You mean 0 they could do that remotely ? E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###SpeakerA30 . ###Yeah . E_S 
168079:5	###Sometimes they put a source light E_S ###and they look at the source light E_S ###and then as the car goes by , you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it E_S ###and you can look at the emissions actually . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###And ... N_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Now where does the source light go *T*-1 ? E_S 
168089:7	###SpeakerA34 . ###Like across the street . E_S ###They 'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###And they 're also looking at , uh , other , you know , ways of * monitoring this \[ and , \+ \] cause they 've found out something *ICH*-1 basically that , uh , N_S ###and a poorly tuned car can emit something , E_S ###it 's an incredible amount . E_S ###It was like four hundred times as much uh , of certain pollutants , and it was like unburned hydrocarbons , then a properly tuned car . E_S 
168113:83	###SpeakerA42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###But \[ if I , \+ uh , if I \] take the bus , it requires several transfers E_S ###and it takes over an hour . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###Huh .

N_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###And you know , I feel guilty cause I 'm driving a , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Uh , anyway , we 're supposed *-1 to talk about recycling . ###Basically , \[ what , \+ what \] your personal opinion *ICH*-3 is *T*-2 on it . E_S ###Uh , \[ this is , \+ this is \] really for a speech research project 0 they 're doing *T*-1 E_S ###so , uh , I do n't know . E_S 
168130:22	###Uh , \[ this is , \+ this is \] really for a speech research project 0 they 're doing *T*-1 E_S ###so , uh , I do n't know . E_S ###Florida is pretty good about recycling is n't it *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Well , they just kicked it off down here \[ in , \+ in \] Sarasota county . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Oh , they did ? E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Uh , they had been doing it , E_S ###they started first in Sarasota City . Uh , you know , which *T*-1 makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually . E_S 
168140:40	###SpeakerB5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###SpeakerB7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###And , uh , they 've got these , I do n't know what , if you 're familiar with Sarasota county at all . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Not quite , E_S ###no . E_S 
168157:7	###SpeakerB13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###SpeakerB15 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###SpeakerB17 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Which , in the paper , *T*-3 it 's just , uh , newspaper and corrugated cardboard . Is the only thing 0 you 're supposed *-1 to put *T*-2 in there . E_S 
168167:4	###SpeakerB19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###SpeakerB21 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###No slicks . Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Oh , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] good . E_S ###* Let me ask you this . E_S 
168185:7	###SpeakerA26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###and they 'd just sort it out for you . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###It was really pretty good if you 're lazy like I am *?* , E_S ###so . N_S 
168202:4	###It 's not Amway E_S ###but it 's the other big vitamin company ? ###Shaklee . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Oh , okay , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Okay .

168217:40	###SpeakerB35 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###\[ Which \+ \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] \] what recycling at home sorting does *T*-1 , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###I mean it 's a little extra work . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S

168333:6	###Are you north of Sarasota or , East , E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###East of Sarasota . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###okay . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###And Sarasota is on the west coast ? E_S ###SpeakerA86 . 
168394:128	###and you need *-1 to make * sure 0 all your bills are paid *-2 . E_S ###Uh , about yourself ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , I have *-1 to say 0 I really do n't have a budget .

168402:65	###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well I guess 0 that really is sort of , uh , keeping a budget , E_S you know . ###You stay \[ within your , \+ uh within your \] means .

168420:77	###SpeakerB12 . ###Oh , you moved from Dallas to San Francisco . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###So , uh uh , that presents \[ a , \+ a \] real shock . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###That is a hugh difference . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah . E_S 
168450:5	###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###And , uh , I noted at that point that \[ I was , \+ you know , if that 's \] what my salary *ICH*-3 was *T*-2 that I drew *T*-1 then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made *?* during his best year ever .

168723:11	###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###It seems bizarre to me . E_S ###I do n't quite understand it , although I think probably 0 \[ the , \+ the \] worst thing that *T*-1 's happening \[ in the world , \+ at least the modern world \] today , is television .

E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Not so much because , uh , it 's bad per se , although there is some pretty crappy programming E_S ###and \[ I thin- , \+ there 's also some , uh , I think , \] uh , poorer lifestyles illustrated * but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time .

168777:19	###SpeakerB24 . ###Do you keep your kids , uh , active in sports or anything E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh , I guess 0 our big outlet is music . ###Uh E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###our thirteen year old son plays violin E_S

168902:197	###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh .

168908:41	###but I know 0 \[ they use that , \+ I mean they sell those , \] N_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well what about , uh , required drug testing , uh , as a , uh , condition of employment ? E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that was , \+ \[ that , \+ that \] was \] the other one 0 I was thinking of *T*-1 . E_S ###I think 0 that 's , uh , N_S 
168926:49	###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###and actually , * to tell you the truth , I really did not think much about it . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] had n't *?* , you know , E_S ###it really did n't relate to me . E_S ###But there were some things *ICH*-3 that people brought *T*-1 up like well what *T*-2 happens if \[ they , \+ they \] get a false positive , you know , what recourse do you have *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . 
168933:47	###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And , also , uh , uh , this is against the law for the government to do \[ this kind of thing , \+ this kind of big brother activity \] E_S ###and yet , uh , a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments , although they do n't admit to it , \[ it 's \+ actually , oh , a drug testing policy comes \] about as a result of government pressure . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###So what that means *T*-1 is , to me , that really it 's the government that *T*-2 's requiring this , E_S ###although they do n't actually \[ e- , \+ execute \] it themselves , it 's really the government that MUMBLEx . N_S 
168933:102	###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###Well \[ \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the , \+ I think that , \] you know , a person 's competence should be more determined *-1 by , you know , their actions and their behavior E_S ###and \[ if they 're , \+ you know , if they 're \] on some kind of , you know , \[ contol- , \+ controlled \] substance then , you know , it kinds of takes away from the job of , you know , the supervisor or manager type person , you know , who *T*-1 is able *-2 to evaluate them .

169056:16	###There are other things such as civil service uh , which many people , uh , are lifelong employees of *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Well , i- , N_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###SpeakerB23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###SpeakerB25 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA26 .

169067:25	###More of a voluntary kind of thing E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###or , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S ###\[ i- , \+ i- , \] N_S ###\[ for , \+ for \] years there has been an idea *ICH*-2 batted * around of * having some sort of alternative , uh , public service 0 for , uh , young people to go into *T*-3 , uh , after high school .

169578:73	###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###And , I guess , also what the system will absorb *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Right .

E_S ###Possibly though on , uh , capital cases like maybe the death penalty N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###uh , I 'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole , N_S ###I mean he could have like a personal prejudice . E_S 
169628:25	###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I , N_S ###something like that , I 've got no problem with it . ###Uh E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
169668:32	###and you 'd hate *-1 to be one of those . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Oh , I 'm sure . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###The other thing 0 they asked about *T*-1 was whether uh , uh , the verdict should be required *-2 to be unanimous .

169677:77	###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###well maybe not . E_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###At least in capital cases I 'd think 0 they 'd have *-1 to be unanimous . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###I believe 0 it is *?* in capital . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###SpeakerB60 . 
169736:70	###SpeakerA81 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###That has been going on . E_S ###My , uh , cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Oh really ? E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###So she follows that stuff pretty closely . E_S 
169788:28	###SpeakerB4 . ###So it 's just sort of , uh , N_S ###they can *?* if they , N_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###They can *?* if they choose *-1 to *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Oh , okay .

169805:6	###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 they 're very accurate E_S ###because , I mean , I know 0 their lifestyles changed \[ p- , \+ prior \] to the drug test E_S ###and I know 0 they changed afterwards . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###See I know of that too . E_S ###And I also know that things like antihistamines , Sudafeds , things like that , can really throw it off . E_S ###And you can not get a job because of it E_S 
169825:7	###and it was some Malaria medication E_S ###and she tested positive for that . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###See , and so it really is a dangerous thing that way E_S ###because I know of somebody that *T*-1 tested for an airline and did n't get the job E_S ###and they were n't told why . E_S ###But a lot of people say 0 the reason why , after you take a physical , will be because of the drug testing E_S ###or they would tell you . E_S ###Or this person never use any drugs . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . 
169844:26	###\[ Are they , \+ I mean , is there \] a margin of error ? E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###The accuracy ? E_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###But , I know 0 there are a lot of things that *T*-1 can influence them E_S ###and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
169865:96	###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###So I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###And \[ I , \+ I 'm \] not so sure 0 they are that needed . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
169893:18	###You know , as a health professional , I would n't want somebody *ICH*-1 to take care of me that *T*-2 was using drugs . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###You know , so as a patient , I feel 0 well , yeah , we probably should be protected *-1 . E_S ###But , on the other hand , there 's a lot of things 0 I should be protected *-1 from *T*-2 that they do n't test my patients for *T*-3 too . E_S ###So you know , I guess 0 \[ you sort of , \+ you \] have *-1 to have trust some place along the way . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
169912:14	###SpeakerB42 . ###And \[ \[ it , \+ it 's \] like , \+ it seems like \] now they have tests E_S ###I guess 0 they can test your hair E_S ###and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Oh , wow ! ###But maybe you should n't be held *-1 responsible for something 0 you did *T*-2 several years ago . E_S

170143:7	###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###And that worked out real well cause we did n't have *-1 to keep *-2 writing down what we 'd spent *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
170560:46	###it was * making the friends and going all the places E_S ###and it was a really neat experience , E_S ###but it took our total time . E_S ###I did not work , uh , when I did this *T*-1 .

170581:16	###SpeakerA58 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###I mean , there were five of us E_S ###and I do n't recall , you know , *-1 wanting anything in particular .

170601:16	###SpeakerB63 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###and I do n't think 0 our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###Atlanta is horrible . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###Is it *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Yes . E_S 
170624:11	###SpeakerB73 . ###They sell their house , E_S ###they stash away a good bit of money and come down here E_S ###and I work with a lot of them , E_S ###\[ they , \+ they \] think 0 \[ they , \+ they \] have really done something .

170630:8	###SpeakerA74 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###SpeakerA76 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###The housing is cheaper , E_S ###but that 's about it . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###I 'm surprised *-1 to hear that . E_S

170695:11	###SpeakerA21 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh , so , N_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###So , \[ wha- , \+ what \] do you have *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###I have a Pontiac Six Thousand . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###All the more reason 0 * to , uh , have \[ a , \+ a \] Honda *T*-1 . E_S

E_S ###But our Honda just got old and just wore out . E_S ###It was , * let 's see , eleven years old E_S ###and it \[ just , \+ just \] out of it N_S ###so . No , E_S 
170719:19	###and everything is wrong with it . E_S ###I mean , the power steering fluid leaks , ###the oil leaks , ###the brake fluid leaks , you know , E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Now thi- , N_S ###\[ wha- , \+ how \] old is the car *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh , eighty-seven . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
170726:16	###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh , eighty-seven . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###And he just does n't take care of things E_S ###\[ and \+ but \] I was awarded *-1 the car E_S ###so .

170754:21	###And , uh , he showed it to me E_S ###and it was old , rusty , just awful . E_S ###It was no more new than nothing . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###So apparently it was the same one that *T*-1 was on there . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh , more than likely . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###* \[ Apparently just , uh , \[ re- , \+ re- , \] \+ uh , probably filled \] \[ the , \+ the \] brake fluid up E_S ###and that was it . E_S 
170771:6	###I guess find a reputable service , E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###\[ And , \+ and \] you \[ ju- , \+ \] can hardly find one , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Huh .

E_S 
170802:16	###because the place where you buy your car *T*-2 , they 're usually the worst one of all . E_S ###We took our Honda to the Honda dealership E_S ###and they ended up *-1 telling us 0 we needed a brand new engine for our car . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And so , idiots as we were *?* , neither one of us knew much about cars , E_S ###\[ we , \+ you know , they told us 0 we \] just had *-1 to have one E_S ###and we bought one . E_S 
170803:14	###We took our Honda to the Honda dealership E_S ###and they ended up *-1 telling us 0 we needed a brand new engine for our car . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Oh , really ?

170825:13	###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , I 'm trying *-1 to think . E_S ###My , uh , uh , wife 's grandmother had Alzheimer 's E_S ###and they were going *-1 to put her into \[ a , \+ a \] nursing home E_S ###and , uh , \[ they , \+ when they \] put her in *T*-1 , she had all kinds of trouble E_S ###and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being \[ \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ you know , a , \] \+ a \] nuisance .

170834:26	###and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being \[ \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ you know , a , \] \+ a \] nuisance . Or worse than a nuisance , E_S ###I mean she sort of went , you know , bananas E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Oh they thought 0 it was too much of a bother . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###and they \[ could n't , \+ could n't \] deal with her . E_S ###So , I guess 0 you need *-1 to , uh , know whether it 's \[ a , \+ you know , a \] no deposit , no return kind of thing whether , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Right . E_S ###If they 're equipped *-1 *-1 \[ too , \+ to \] handle the kind of patients 0 you 're going *-3 to have *T*-2 you know , put *-4 in there too . E_S 
170869:78	###But I think 0 the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home *T*-1 is only like six months or something . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Well a lot of it 's probably *-1 to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###They need health care E_S ###so they 're already ill before they go . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S 
170884:91	###Then you only go there as a last resort . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Or people send you there as a last resort . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###That 's what my grandparents , N_S ###it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind *-1 knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . E_S 
170893:11	###it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind *-1 knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So that was their thinking . E_S ###Somebody who *T*-1 would know what * to do *T*-2 in the event of an emergency . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed *T*-1 while they still had choices 0 * to make *T*-2 . So they would n't be stuck *-3 going into just whatever nursing home *T*-4 was available at the time . E_S 
170899:8	###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed *T*-1 while they still had choices 0 * to make *T*-2 . So they would n't be stuck *-3 going into just whatever nursing home *T*-4 was available at the time . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###I guess 0 that 's a problem *ICH*-1 too for people . Wait lists and all . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S 
170899:22	###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed *T*-1 while they still had choices 0 * to make *T*-2 .

170903:109	###SpeakerA31 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###I guess 0 that 's a problem *ICH*-1 too for people . Wait lists and all . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###That , uh , N_S ###you ca n't always get in when you want *-1 too *?* *T*-2 E_S 
170913:22	###and of course , you ca n't just sit around and wait . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Right . E_S ###When you need it *T*-1 , you need it I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###And the money *ICH*-3 is also another issue . How you 're going *-1 to pay for it *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
170917:6	###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###And the money *ICH*-3 is also another issue . How you 're going *-1 to pay for it *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###At that stage of life you only have so much money left * E_S ###and I guess 0 it *EXP*-1 's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have *-3 to put it in their savings . E_S 
170922:29	###SpeakerA39 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###At that stage of life you only have so much money left * E_S ###and I guess 0 it *EXP*-1 's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have *-3 to put it in their savings . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###I mean it is kind of fair , E_S ###but it 's also not fair because they have their own children 0 * to raise *T*-1 . E_S 
170944:54	###and they 're not necessarily enjoying life anymore . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well maybe that 's the purpose of the nursing home is * to have them go someplace where they can see that it 's not worth * continuing *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###It *EXP*-3 's just a shame 0 that 's the way 0 it has *-1 to be *T*-4 . E_S ###I think 0 the retirement home idea 's a nice idea . ###* To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace 0 * to stay *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S 
170948:58	###SpeakerB48 . ###It *EXP*-3 's just a shame 0 that 's the way 0 it has *-1 to be *T*-4 .

E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###and cause like if your spouse died , MUMBLEx all alone , it *EXP*-1 'd be nice * to go someplace with people similar to you . To have friends . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S 
170969:74	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well I can profit by this because I 'm due with my first in about three months . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Is that right . E_S ###I guess , uh , 0 the only rule , uh , 0 I can think of *T*-1 is that I like *-2 to look for places with , uh , good respectable , nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that . E_S ###If they 're associated *-1 with a college or a university , they 're usually a pretty good bet . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh , I think 0 it 's sort of the opposite of what you would want *T*-2 when you buy a car or refrigerator something *T*-1 . E_S 
170979:40	###You 'd like *-1 to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###I guess not , E_S usu- , N_S ###I suppose 0 you 're absolutely right there . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###For profit places , I would really look at them awfully carefully E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
170979:57	###You 'd like *-1 to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care .

E_S ###For profit places , I would really look at them awfully carefully E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
170990:32	###and , uh , the child care center associated * with our university was quite good E_S ###so I felt confident that they 'd do right . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###Of , N_S ###\[ are n't \+ do n't \] \[ they kind of use them for , \+ everybody kind of use them for \] guinea pigs ? \[ For their per- , \+ for their pet theories \] or some such thing ? E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Oh , you mean , uh , learning type , 
171030:64	###but N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###I do n't think 0 it 's as common as , uh , the newspapers would make you believe . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###And another thing is cost . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S 
171043:50	###and \[ they finding , \+ in some cases they 're finding \] 0 it *EXP*-1 's just not worth it * to work because it 's all going out in daycare . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Well , in our case , we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were , uh , in school . E_S ###And I 'm really happy 0 we did it , although it was very , very difficult . E_S ###And I think 0 it was the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
171090:40	###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###And \[ I think 0 you have , \+ the main thing is that you have \] *-1 to determine that they 're perfectly open .

171090:74	###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh .

171135:4	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , uh , I ca n't be terribly authoritative on what life was like *T*-1 thirty years ago , uh , because I 'm not that old yet . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###I can be *?* , E_S ###but * go ahead . E_S ###SpeakerB6 .

171174:43	###and you had *-1 to do something , E_S ###this was concerning the S E C , E_S ###and so if they had business 0 * to do *T*-1 , they had *-2 to finish it , you know , three days in advance so they could get it through the mail .

171239:24	###SpeakerB38 . ###Well , there 's that E_S ###and there 's the fact that , you know , nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding *-1 to have kids which *T*-2 generally tends *-3 to happen . E_S ###I mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it were n't for the fact that we , have continuation , large scale immigration into the country .

171262:4	###SpeakerB44 . ###Well , uh , In terms of the long term \[ effect , \+ effect \] \[ on , \+ on \] America , in terms of the culture and everything , I do n't know .

E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I do n't know either . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
171279:43	###SpeakerA53 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###I mean , it 's no longer \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ uh , the \] accomplishment \[ that it , \+ that it \] once was *T*-1 E_S ###and not that many people are really trying I do n't think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's kind of scary . E_S 
171297:23	###Uh , I know 0 what I 'm seeing *T*-1 here at \[ m- , \+ my \] job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they 're establishing careers E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah , E_S ###tha- , N_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###and they 've got their homes E_S ###and they 've got , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Why do n't you go ahead and start *T*-1 .

173858:69	###I think 0 it was added *-1 afterwards . E_S ###I think 0 \[ the real , \+ the principal \] was , uh , education for civic participation . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Right .

174524:23	###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh .

174561:95	###SpeakerA53 . ###Right , E_S ###exactly .

174685:11	###There is , N_S ###like , uh , that 's , N_S ###in fact , a big gubernatorial issue is \[ the \+ the \] turnover rates of , uh , \[ r- , \+ uh , repeat \] offenders being let *-1 out and doing it again .

176534:11	###* Goes , well , okay , E_S ###so it 's not like he 's going *-1 to infect her kids .

176563:28	###No , E_S ###she did n't do that . E_S ###So , it got to the point where \[ he 's , \+ he 's \] supposed *-1 to get out of , uh , kindergarten like about two thirty *T*-2 .

176582:53	###SpeakerA66 . ###Yeah , E_S ###a little more flexibility . E_S ###You can come and go .

176700:74	###SpeakerB31 . ###Is that done *-1 , N_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###SpeakerB33 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###And , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###Now * \[ l- , \+ let \] me ask you this .

177158:8	###SpeakerA57 . ###I 'm with the F B I . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Oh . E_S ###Oh , that 's interesting . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yes . E_S ###\[ \[ \[ An- , \+ and so , \] \+ uh , uh , and , \] \+ and \] the reason 0 I 'm doing this whole thing *T*-1 is because Rick , who *T*-4 's another government employee wanted \[ a spe- , \+ segments \] of my speech , \[ that \+ that \] *T*-2 were done *-3 a year ago E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . 
177166:105	###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###SpeakerB62 . ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###and he wanted another collection a year later . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Oh . E_S 
177183:65	###SpeakerA1 . ###And you say 0 you have some strong feelings about , uh , the issue ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , yes E_S ###I do \[ \[ as far as , \+ uh , as far as , \] \+ uh , as far as \] immigration as a whole goes *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###I think that , uh , we simply must start *-1 accepting everybody in the world . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
177199:51	###Uh , I hope 0 you 're one of the employed right now . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###I am one of the unemployed right now . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company E_S ###and , uh , I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that *T*-1 they had two hundred openings E_S ###but they had two thousand applications . E_S 
177221:9	###SpeakerA17 . ###Well , I 'm a little bit ambivalent . E_S ###\[ The problem with , \+ uh , and I think 0 one of the problems with \] immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing *-1 to discuss it , uh , \[ in , \+ in \] terms of what , uh , *T*-2 really is driving it . E_S ###They 're not willing *-1 to tell the truth . The same way with , uh , issues of , uh , race and things like that . E_S ###I mean right now , uh , I believe 0 there are two policies \[ that , \+ uh , that \] the government uses *T*-1 *-2 to modulate immigration . ###Three actually . E_S ###One is at the high end , uh , E_S ###they always want *-1 to be able *-2 to , uh , do some brain draining . E_S ###They always like *-1 to be able *-2 to attract the , uh , Einsteins or the Professor Chou E_S ###or , you know . N_S 
177224:143	###They 're not willing *-1 to tell the truth . The same way with , uh , issues of , uh , race and things like that .

177256:4	###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh , that 's one of the few things I guess 0 I found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan *T*-1 . E_S ###I think 0 they 're a very difficult group 0 * to integrate *T*-1 into , uh , society . E_S ###They 're very difficult , uh , group 0 * to find jobs \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] uh , places for *T*-1 . E_S ###And so , uh , uh , I do n't deny that we may have been involved in * causing the problem \[ that , \+ uh , in that \] they 're pretty miserable where they are *T*-1 . E_S ###But I 'm not to sympathetic about , uh , * letting large numbers of Haitians in . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Actually , actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S 
177261:104	###But I 'm not to sympathetic about , uh , * letting large numbers of Haitians in . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Actually , actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###And it would have nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with political situations . E_S ###It would have *-1 to do with poverty . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Right . E_S 
177290:89	###SpeakerB42 . ###But there 's some differences in the immigrants , \[ that , \+ that \] we 're getting *T*-1 now . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###SpeakerB44 . ###Well I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . ###Sure . E_S 
177290:100	###SpeakerB42 . ###But there 's some differences in the immigrants , \[ that , \+ that \] we 're getting *T*-1 now .

177302:43	###SpeakerA49 . ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###But , uh , the majority of the illegal immigration 0 we 're getting *T*-1 now , they do not come here *-2 to blend into America . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh , \[ they , \+ they \] do n't bother *-1 to learn our language E_S ###and , uh , first of all , \[ th- , \+ they , \] N_S 
177322:28	###And we keep the newspapers \[ in a , \+ in a , \] N_S ###they *ICH*-5 're collected *-6 twice a month and the trash \[ and , \+ and \] this bottled stuff that *T*-1 is put *-2 \[ in a , \+ in a \] little blue bin that *T*-3 's picked *-4 up and sorted *-4 out into a truck . E_S ###So they \[ ma- , \+ actually have \] about three passes at this collection . One for the regular trash , one for the , uh , uh , you know , the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###* Sounds , N_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###SpeakerB5 . ###But I gather 0 you do not separate , uh , the bottles and cans . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###No , E_S 
177351:35	###and , uh , landfill space is , in deed , the driving factor here . E_S ###And , in fact , uh , despite all of our open space out here , landfill space is still , uh , very hard 0 * to come by *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###My , you 've got \[ a lot \+ \[ a , \+ a \] lot \] of nothing out there .

177365:65	###SpeakerB17 . ###Well , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Uh , \[ other , \+ other \] than * nuking it . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Yes , E_S ###other than * nuking it . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###SpeakerB21 . ###Um , in fact , Los Alamos , uh , has , uh , done a fair amount of research , uh , in * recycling things in general . E_S 
177376:59	###SpeakerA22 . ###Well , \[ \[ is n't that a , \+ that 's a , \] \+ that 's \] pretty , uh , upscale , uh , trash , uh , uh , situation . E_S ###I do n't think 0 anybody around here would understand \[ all the , \+ all those \] exotic techniques , you know , * getting rid *-1 of the heavy metals . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###SpeakerA24 . ###SpeakerB25 . ###And the thing that *T*-1 just was in the local news bulletin was , somebody \[ \[ has , \+ uh , ter- , \] \+ made \] some special , uh , polymers that *T*-2 have the ability * to , uh , make certain actinide elements adhere to them . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###SpeakerB27 . ###Uh , uh , they 've , uh , looked at , uh , plutonium and uranium and , uh , some other similar things *-2 to try *-1 to remove those from radio active waste E_S 
177395:8	###and , uh , in fact I think 0 I was the first person in our department 0 *T*-1 to have my thesis published *-2 on \[ recyclable pa- , \+ recycled paper . \] E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###SpeakerA34 . ###Well that 's certainly , uh , you know , uh , getting into the swim of things . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ it should be , \+ \[ i- , \+ it \] should go \] \[ to the , \+ to the \] heart of the matter though and say , okay guy , E_S ###\[ \[ you , \+ y- , \] \+ everybody \] gets , you know , five pounds of garbage that they can throw *T*-1 away , you know . E_S ###Uh , but more than that every week , uh , you 've got *-1 to pay by the pound . E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I \] think \+ I think \] 0 \[ people \[ would be , \+ would get \] \[ very , \+ very , \] \+ you know , they 'd be very \] careful about how they bought stuff *T*-1 . E_S 
177405:132	###SpeakerB35 . ###I think 0 that 's a wonderful idea . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###SpeakerB37 . ###The only alternative 0 I would see *T*-1 is , uh , and this would actually be a little more workable since * weighing everybody 's garbage would be a real pain . Uh , if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would , uh , speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . 
177431:7	###and I like *-1 to run , uh , m- , N_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I like \] *-1 to run , get my heartbeat up .

177625:78	###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and , uh , we stripped it all the way down and refinished it E_S ###and it turned out *-1 to be \[ really nice , \+ uh , a nice desk . \] ###Maple top I think \[ or \+ or \] something of that sort .

177701:16	###You know I , N_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh , I guess 0 it , N_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Because he was tell me like the ones that you dial *T*-1 in are n't all that great .
