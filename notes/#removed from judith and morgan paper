\citeA{hamblin1973} proposed that the meaning of a question was the set of possible answers, and that to know the meaning of a question was to know the possible answers. Hamblin himself did not extend his semantic theory beyond root question, so when researchers began looking into embedded \whqs, discussion revolved around which answers the answer set should contain. \citeA{karttunen1977} noted that questions in embedded contexts appeared to impose a veridicality requirement on the set of possible answers, and proposed a semantic treatment that would later be described as denoting \emph{weak exhaustivity}. On a weak exhaustive semantics, a sentence like \ref{coffee2} would be true if Dana knew all the true answers to the questions (=the positive extension)---the \emph{wh}-clause denotes the conjunction of the true answers. It is weakly exhasutive because it predicts that the sentence would be true even if she was ignorant or had false beliefs about the false answers to the question (=the negative extension).

\begin{exe}
\ex Dana knows where we can find coffee. \label{coffee2}
\end{exe}

\citeA{groenstok1982,groenstok1984} argued that Karttunen's semantics was in fact too weak, and proposed a partition semantics that would later be called \emph{strongly exhaustive}. It is strongly exhaustive because it predicts that knowing where to find coffee means knowing, for every relevant place, whether one can find coffee at that place (i.e., both the positive and negative extension).

Later researchers would come to distinguish a third degree of exhaustsivity \mm{Spector 2005?? Kleindinst \& Rothschild 2011...}. Intermediate exhaustivity is essentially weak exhaustivity plus a ban on Dana's having any false beliefs about the negative extension. Thus, an intermediate exhaustive reading would be true in a context where Dana is only ignorant about the negative extension, and false in a context where she had false beliefs about it. In contrast, a weak exhaustive reading would be true in both contexts.

\citeA{heim1994} provided an innovation by introducing two different \textbf{answerhood operators}, thus capturing both weak and strong exhaustivity. The choice between operators is determine by the lexical semantics of the matrix question-embedding verb. Verbs like \emph{know}, or verbs who have similar meanings (Heim mentions \emph{find out}, \emph{realize}, \emph{remember}, \emph{wonder}) seem to require strong exhaustivity; while \emph{surprise}; and then ``speech act verbs'' like \emph{tell}, \emph{write down}, \emph{divulge}, \emph{remind}, \emph{ask} appear to allow both. Heim presents these as mere observations, but her theory in principle allows flexibility between verbs and the two readings. \citeA{dayal1996} argued that the answerhood operator functioned similarly in meaning to a definite description, including a uniqueness presupposition that there was a single (maximally informative) true answer to the question. This captures a Karttunen weak exhaustivity. To capture strong exhaustivty, \cite{dayal2016} adopts Heim's second operator. \citeA{beckrull1999} also adopt a multiple answerhood operator approach, and include a third one for MS.

\citeA{klineroth2011} also introduced a reconciliation using an exhaustivity operator. They derive weak exhaustivity from the question denotation without the operator, strong exhaustivity when the operator is in the embedded clause, and intermediate exhaustivity when the operator is in the matrix clause (of an embedded \emph{wh}-report). 

The bulk of work in semantic theory after the greatest hits of Karttunen and Groenendijk \& Stokhof have been concerned with degrees of MA (weak, intermediate, and strong exhaustivity) and how \whqs in embedded environments interact with Matrix embedding verbs (\cite{heim1994,beckrull1999,sharvit2002,lahiri2002,specegr2015,uegaki2014,uegaki2015,theiler2014,theiroealo2016}), and negative polarity items (\cite{guerzshar2007,sharvit2002,nicolae2014,vanrooij2003}\mm{schwarz 2017}) to test which level of exhaustivity should be underlying. It's possible that some of these accounts could be extended to deal with MS and so are not necessarily inherently opposed. \jd{opposed to what? what is the relevance of this paragraph? none of this appears to be related to the experimental work reported below -- either relate or delete}




\subsubsection{Disagreement about the representation of Mention-Some}
Despite the traditional focus on MA readings, there is work on MS readings. MS readings were acknowledged as early as \citeA{hintikka1976} \mm{and 1978}, who argued that questions should be \textbf{semantically ambiguous} between an existential (MS) and universal (MA) reading. Other semantic treatments of MS didn't arise until much later, when \citeA{ginzburg1995a,ginzburg1995b} argued that neither strong (i.e., a G\&S semantics) nor weak (i.e., a Karttunen semantics) exhaustivity should be semantically encoded. He argued that \whqs should be treated as underspecified in the semantics, and left the question of (non-)exhaustivity to a pragmatic process determined by an inference about what resolves the questioner's goal, given their epistemic state. The inference concerns the rhetorical relations between information in a discourse. Whereas Ginzberg's theory did not implement this relation in a compositional semantic framework, \citeA{asherlascarides1998} did so using Segmented Discourse Representation Structures (\mm{asher1993, asher lascarides 1994}). \citeA{vanrooij2003,vanrooij2004} also provided a semantic treatment of MS and MA, where questions involve a covert operator \mm{anaphoric} to a contextual decision problem which determines a ranking of answers based on the answer's utility. 

Other researchers have provided semantic explanations for MS using more traditional formalisms. For example, \cite{beckrull1999}'s semantic theory build off Heim's by essentially including a third answerhood operator for MS. \citeA{lahiri2002} similarly defines several answerhood operators. Lahiri derives MS from two components: a covert quantifier with semantics similar to \emph{enough} whose quantificational force varies contextually; and, a contextual variable on a generalized answerhood operator who relativizes the the informativeness of an answer to context.

\citeA{george2011} Chapter 2 provides a syntactic/semantic account for MS. In their theory, (strong) MA is derived via presence of an exhaustivity operator (EXH) which takes a Hamblin set and turns it into a partition on logial space (a strong exhaustive denotation), while MS (and weak MA) is derived from the absence of the operator. Theories appealing to multiple answerhood operators could be described as lexical ambiguity theories, while theories that appeal to structural differences could be descibed as structural ambiguity theories.

Some theoreticians provide \textbf{mixed accounts}, which posit semantic MS in a subset of \whq forms. \citeA{george2011}, Chapter 6, \citeA{nicolae2014}, \citeA{fox2014}, \mm{fox 2018? 2020?}, and \citeA{xiang2016} \mm{xiang 2020}. These accounts have responded to observation 2 \mm{reference it}, that MS appears to be grammatically licensed by some kind of existential element. Because all of these theoretical accounts involve some kind of exhaustivity operator, the presence of the existential element is necessary to causes a scope interaction that allows for semantic MS. Accordingly, questions that do not contain such an element would then have an MA semantics due to the presence of the exhaustivity operator. The only way to derive MS in these non-modal/non-existential questions would be through appeal to a pragmatic mechanism (see for example discussions in \cite{xiang2016} pp. 55), or by attributing MS to some other lexical/syntactic element in the question form.

\citeA{karttunen1977} presented the first arguments against a semantic treatment of the mention-some reading. First, if an existential readings was indeed available, then (\ref{contradiction}) should not be a contradiction, contrary to Karttunen's intuitions. Second, Karttunen argued that the unavailability of explicitly marked non-exhasutivity in embedded questions, as in (\ref{forinstance}), provided further evidence against a semantic mention-some.
\begin{exe}
\ex {} \label{contradiction}
    \begin{xlist}
        \ex \# Dana remembers who came to the party last night, but she doesn't remember that Mary came.
    \end{xlist}
\ex {} \label{forinstance}
    \begin{xlist}
        \ex Who, for instance, came to the party last night?
        \ex $\ast$ Dana knows who, for instance, came to the party last night.
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The unembeddability of pragmatic phenomenon was a typical argument against embedded pragmatic MS, and relfections of it can be seen even as recently as George (2011) and Xiang (2016). However, the legitimacy of this kind of argument has been called into question with the rise of semantic theories that can predict embedded MS and still appeal to contextual/intentional information, as well as advances in the psycholinguistics of pragmatic processing which questions the modular separation between semantic and pragmatic processing that unembeddability arguments assume.
